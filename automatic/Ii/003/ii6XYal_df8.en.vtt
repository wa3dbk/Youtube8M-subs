00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.549
 good friends of youtube in this new 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.490
 We are going to show you how to make a video 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:14.019
 backup or save our applications 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:17.110
 of our iphone or ipod touch since yes 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.950
 some day some mistake happens or we have to 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.720
 make a manager of our iphone 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.150
 we will have our applications 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.420
 saved in our pc for then without 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.510
 pay for them let's start 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.460
 The first thing we need is a 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.620
 program called tools 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.390
 in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.760
 leave the link to download it 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.970
 this program works for both mac 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.650
 as for windows 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.320
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.840
 connect our iphone to our 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.540
 computer 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 open the itunes program that I'm here 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.770
 and that has the balloon as if it were from a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.770
 Bunny we open it 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 here 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.310
 how can you see 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.350
 is the description of our iphone in 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 iphone 3gs case 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.860
 in our summary presents some 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.430
 information like the name of the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.880
 device if it is activated or not if 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 has jailbreak or no color and those things 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.759
 to make a backup we direct it to the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.159
 Application tab below 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.200
 name of our iphone and here we 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.350
 can present all applications 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.290
 that we have installed in our 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.210
 device 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.610
 here gives us some options like 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.800
 uninstall make a backup that is what 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.630
 what will we do now 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.159
 to open the folder where 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.400
 the files of said are located 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.130
 application 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.290
 what we are going to do first is to do 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.800
 click on any application that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.520
 we want to save as for example this 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.039
 Facebook Messenger called them to backup 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 new to a question that if we want 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.050
 do a little bit of this application we are 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.350
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.440
 and we choose a folder in which they go 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.000
 to store all 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.030
 the applications that we will be this 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 Bank 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.350
 ok open and instantly 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.240
 you start calling a bar the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.240
 bosco process 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.010
 once the process is finished we 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.939
 we go to that folder where 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.939
 we save your application 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.950
 as you can see it is here and it is saved 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.530
 as a point and for 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.989
 that we can either move to another 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 device or return it to 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.500
 reinstall on our device 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.330
 such as I will uninstall 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.450
 mine only that leaves you with style or 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.319
 uninstall 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.319
 to confirm 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 as you see, our 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.100
 application to reinstall 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 after the baco we go here 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.350
 above 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.350
 where it says install or install 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.480
 we look for the application that we want as 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 for example facebook messenger like this 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.010
 we give to open 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.080
 and they wait like here under gun put it 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.080
 it's being installed 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.489
 and unpacking the package from the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.430
 installation 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.609
 this can sometimes take a lot 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.299
 sometimes little depending on the 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.519
 resources of our browser this is 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.109
 something very important because if we do not have 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.129
 to download again all the 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:12.189
 applications that we had installed in 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.700
 our device should be noted that this 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.280
 program does not work for tweets or 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.250
 for installed applications 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.490
 directly from cydia unfortunately 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.490
 since this does not recognize 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.800
 we'll see 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.250
 lasts a little 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.980
 is that my device is an iphone 3gs 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.000
 already a little old and for that reason lasted more 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.600
 to iphone 4 4 times 5 users 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.540
 act more 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.540
 Quick 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.540
 logically 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.810
 ok here we see how it has been installed 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.260
 again our application 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.730
 in our very practical device very 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.730
 simple easy to use 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.849
 hopefully this video has served 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.189
 Of something 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.320
 and do not have any problem any 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.560
 doubt comment 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.690
 do not hesitate to answer
