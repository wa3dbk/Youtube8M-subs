hey guys pxq in here and today i'm going
to<00:00:02.520> be<00:00:02.580> unboxing<00:00:02.850> animo<00:00:03.389> u<00:00:03.449> s--<00:00:03.600> cube<00:00:04.049> from

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
to be unboxing animo u s-- cube from

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:16.910 
to be unboxing animo u s-- cube from
cubes<00:00:04.770> calm<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> when<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> got<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> package<00:00:16.619> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
cubes calm so when I got this package it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.599 
cubes calm so when I got this package it
was<00:00:17.250> already<00:00:17.880> open<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:20.340> came

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
was already open like this and it came

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
in a guys package like that I think

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.029 
in a guys package like that I think
customs<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> hold<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.650> opened

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
customs got a hold of it and they opened

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.900 
customs got a hold of it and they opened
it<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> pieces<00:00:29.220> some

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it all up and so all the pieces some

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.139 
it all up and so all the pieces some
pieces<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.300> inside<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> big<00:00:30.900> package<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
pieces are inside the big package and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
pieces are inside the big package and
it's<00:00:33.149> been<00:00:33.710> disassembled

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's been disassembled

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's been disassembled
but<00:00:34.950> anyways<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:35.489> first<00:00:35.760> looks<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> looks

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but anyways from first looks it looks

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.139 
but anyways from first looks it looks
really<00:00:37.140> nice<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.700> excited<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
really nice and I'm really excited for

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.690 
really nice and I'm really excited for
this<00:00:39.360> cube<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.530> course<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.160> by<00:00:41.399> MOU

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
this cube because of course it's by MOU

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250 
this cube because of course it's by MOU
and<00:00:42.149> recently<00:00:42.629> I've<00:00:42.809> gotten<00:00:42.840> really

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and recently I've gotten really

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
and recently I've gotten really
interested<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.890> SKU<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.640> surprised

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
interested in SKU I'm surprised

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
interested in SKU I'm surprised
surprised<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> special

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
surprised that they don't have a special

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.209 
surprised that they don't have a special
name<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.680> they<00:00:49.680> even<00:00:49.890> had<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> name

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
name for it like they even had a name

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
name for it like they even had a name
for<00:00:50.280> their<00:00:50.520> shapeshifter<00:00:51.090> cubes<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> Yi

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
for their shapeshifter cubes like the Yi

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860 
for their shapeshifter cubes like the Yi
lines<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.980> I'm<00:00:53.430> surprised<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.660> called

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
lines but I'm surprised they just called

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.439 
lines but I'm surprised they just called
it<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> ammonia<00:00:55.289> cube<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.070> that's

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
it the ammonia cube so that's

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:57.740 
it the ammonia cube so that's
interesting

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
interesting

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
interesting
so<00:00:58.140> anyways<00:00:58.440> while<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> open<00:00:59.219> let's<00:00:59.640> just

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so anyways while it is open let's just

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420 
so anyways while it is open let's just
take<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> quick<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> internals<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
take a quick look at the internals so we

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
take a quick look at the internals so we
can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.180> large<00:01:03.449> torpedoes

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can see it has these large torpedoes

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
can see it has these large torpedoes
here<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.589> been<00:01:04.739> screwed<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.159> love<00:01:05.309> with

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
here that have been screwed in love with

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.840 
here that have been screwed in love with
that<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.260> we've<00:01:07.260> got<00:01:07.530> ball<00:01:07.979> bearings<00:01:08.490> here

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that and we've got ball bearings here

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.800 
that and we've got ball bearings here
and<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:10.470> looks<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.040> interesting<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.600> has<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and it looks very interesting it has a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
and it looks very interesting it has a
lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.290> indents<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.729> that's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
lot of these indents here so that's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
lot of these indents here so that's
really<00:01:15.360> cool<00:01:15.630> okay<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.830> wasn't<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.340> hard<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
really cool okay so it wasn't as hard to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
really cool okay so it wasn't as hard to
put<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:17.939> together<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.170> shrink<00:01:19.409> house

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
put back together as the shrink house

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 
put back together as the shrink house
cube<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.479> mean<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.200> let's<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.530> into

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
cube so I mean it's now let's get into

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.990 
cube so I mean it's now let's get into
first<00:01:22.920> terms<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.549> excited<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.880> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
first terms I'm really excited for this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
first terms I'm really excited for this
because<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:25.020> looks<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> pre

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because it looks a lot like a pre

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
because it looks a lot like a pre
florian<00:01:26.610> modded<00:01:26.970> violence<00:01:27.689> cube<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.439> has<00:01:28.680> very

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
florian modded violence cube it has very

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
florian modded violence cube it has very
large<00:01:29.220> holes<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> has<00:01:30.360> large<00:01:30.750> torpedoes

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
large holes here and has large torpedoes

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:48.539 
large holes here and has large torpedoes
as<00:01:31.530> well<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.400> let's<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:32.909> first<00:01:33.090> terms

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.359 

okay<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.319> it's<00:01:51.319> really<00:01:51.469> nice<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.859> has<00:01:52.039> it's

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
okay so it's really nice it has it's

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.240 
okay so it's really nice it has it's
more<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.630> feeling<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.049> closer<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.770> landline

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
more the feeling is closer to a landline

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.179 
more the feeling is closer to a landline
than<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> trying<00:01:55.759> show

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
than a trying show

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.760 
than a trying show
and<00:01:58.189> how's<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.060> clicky<00:01:59.479> feel<00:01:59.719> whereas<00:02:00.649> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
and how's that clicky feel whereas the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.359 
and how's that clicky feel whereas the
Changjo<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.789> more<00:02:01.999> boxy<00:02:02.630> feeling<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.369> don't

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
Changjo is more boxy feeling I don't

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.440 
Changjo is more boxy feeling I don't
know<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.549> lot<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.729> people<00:02:04.969> when<00:02:05.090> they<00:02:05.119> took<00:02:05.329> out

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
know a lot of people when they took out

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.910 
know a lot of people when they took out
the<00:02:05.569> ball<00:02:05.719> bearings<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:06.170> their<00:02:06.439> trunk<00:02:06.740> shows

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the ball bearings in their trunk shows

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.719 
the ball bearings in their trunk shows
cube<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.310> got<00:02:07.459> a<00:02:07.609> lot<00:02:07.759> faster<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:10.009> feels

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
cube it got a lot faster but it feels

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.520 
cube it got a lot faster but it feels
very<00:02:10.759> sluggish<00:02:11.330> compared<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> mill<00:02:12.349> used

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
very sluggish compared to the mill used

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.690 
very sluggish compared to the mill used
to<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.769> because<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.099> volume<00:02:13.340> tube<00:02:13.519> is

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
to do because the volume tube is

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:27.190 
to do because the volume tube is
incredibly<00:02:14.330> fast<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.599> hear<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> springs

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
incredibly fast you can hear the springs

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.069 
incredibly fast you can hear the springs
are<00:02:27.349> very<00:02:27.530> loud<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.599> clicks

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
are very loud in there and it clicks

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:39.520 
are very loud in there and it clicks
into<00:02:30.319> place<00:02:30.470> nicely<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.900> when<00:02:39.230> you're<00:02:39.349> in<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
into place nicely but when you're in the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.410 
into place nicely but when you're in the
momentum<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.220> turning<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.910> doesn't<00:02:41.239> click

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
momentum of turning it doesn't click

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.809 
momentum of turning it doesn't click
into<00:02:41.629> place<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:42.079> lot<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.859> very<00:02:43.190> similar<00:02:43.730> to

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
into place a lot it's very similar to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.309 
into place a lot it's very similar to
the<00:02:43.970> landline<00:02:44.209> skew<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.569> has<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.900> clicky

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
the landline skew it has that clicky

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:54.490 
the landline skew it has that clicky
sound<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:52.519> feels<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.090> much<00:02:53.150> faster<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.170> I

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
sound it feels so much faster and I I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.259 
sound it feels so much faster and I I
feel<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.340> can<00:02:55.489> do<00:02:55.609> finger<00:02:55.910> tricks<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.239> lot

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
feel like I can do finger tricks a lot

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.020 
feel like I can do finger tricks a lot
easier<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.260> lot<00:02:57.500> faster<00:02:58.040> compared

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
easier on this and a lot faster compared

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.129 
easier on this and a lot faster compared
to<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.299> shengshou<00:03:01.359> it<00:03:02.359> also<00:03:02.480> has<00:03:02.780> kind<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.049> a

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
to the shengshou it also has kind of a

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.650 
to the shengshou it also has kind of a
dry<00:03:03.319> feeling<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.160> aolong<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.359> not

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
dry feeling like the aolong but it's not

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.559 
dry feeling like the aolong but it's not
as<00:03:05.900> much<00:03:06.440> it's<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.669> very<00:03:08.030> subtle

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
as much it's just it's very subtle

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.759 
as much it's just it's very subtle
so<00:03:09.109> it's<00:03:10.010> also<00:03:10.310> has<00:03:10.760> very<00:03:11.299> loose<00:03:11.480> tensions<00:03:11.959> Wow

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
so it's also has very loose tensions Wow

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.400 
so it's also has very loose tensions Wow
you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.669> just<00:03:13.849> open<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.389> up<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.810> look<00:03:15.079> at<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
you can just open it up and look at the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.860 
you can just open it up and look at the
core<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.669> you<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.630> see<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
core just like that and you can see the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.140 
core just like that and you can see the
screws<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.440> everything<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:19.489> very<00:03:19.790> loose

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
screws and everything it's very loose

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.870 
screws and everything it's very loose
and<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.690> just<00:03:20.840> easy<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:22.549> with<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and it's just easy to like with the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.059 
and it's just easy to like with the
shank<00:03:23.090> show<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.569> very<00:03:23.660> tight<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:26.919> using<00:03:27.919> the

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
shank show it's very tight and using the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.970 
shank show it's very tight and using the
MOE<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.280> skew<00:03:28.669> reminds<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.389> of<00:03:29.419> mo<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.349> cubes

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
MOE you skew reminds you of mo you cubes

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.129 
MOE you skew reminds you of mo you cubes
in<00:03:31.190> general<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:31.819> its<00:03:32.599> name<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.930> shank

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
in general and its name with the shank

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.990 
in general and its name with the shank
shot<00:03:33.349> reminds<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:33.889> Changjo<00:03:34.459> brand<00:03:34.760> cubes

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
shot reminds you of Changjo brand cubes

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.909 
shot reminds you of Changjo brand cubes
it<00:03:35.150> gets<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.109> kind<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.349> like<00:03:36.530> shank

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
it gets this just kind of like shank

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.460 
it gets this just kind of like shank
shot<00:03:37.130> through<00:03:37.310> by<00:03:37.430> threes<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.690> French<00:03:39.079> f4

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
shot through by threes and a French f4

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.250 
shot through by threes and a French f4
f4<00:03:39.769> sort<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.669> this<00:03:41.239> one's<00:03:41.419> a<00:03:41.510> lot<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.870> MOU

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
f4 sort of this one's a lot like MOU

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.710 
f4 sort of this one's a lot like MOU
speed<00:03:42.680> cubes<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.970> definitely<00:03:44.359> gives<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.690> a

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
speed cubes so it definitely gives you a

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.009 
speed cubes so it definitely gives you a
mo<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.079> feel<00:03:45.590> when<00:03:46.010> you're<00:03:46.190> solving<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:47.019> it's

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
mo you feel when you're solving it it's

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.159 
mo you feel when you're solving it it's
definitely<00:03:48.349> a<00:03:49.220> really<00:03:49.910> really<00:03:50.540> good<00:03:50.720> cube<00:03:51.049> I'd

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
definitely a really really good cube I'd

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.050 
definitely a really really good cube I'd
probably<00:03:51.500> say<00:03:51.799> it's<00:03:51.919> the<00:03:52.040> best<00:03:52.220> skew<00:03:52.819> right

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
probably say it's the best skew right

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.660 
probably say it's the best skew right
now<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:54.319> can't<00:03:54.530> believe<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.739> just<00:03:54.919> pumped

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
now and I can't believe that just pumped

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
now and I can't believe that just pumped
so<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.390> think<00:03:57.690> this<00:03:58.080> might<00:03:58.319> have<00:03:58.470> really<00:03:58.770> loose

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
so I think this might have really loose

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.010 
so I think this might have really loose
tensions<00:03:59.610> I'll<00:03:59.790> probably<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.450> tension

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
tensions I'll probably have to tension

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.100 
tensions I'll probably have to tension
this<00:04:01.140> if<00:04:01.440> popping<00:04:02.220> becomes<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.640> problem<00:04:02.850> but<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
this if popping becomes a problem but I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.320 
this if popping becomes a problem but I
don't<00:04:04.980> think<00:04:05.130> popping<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:05.940> be<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> problem

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
don't think popping will be a problem

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.620 
don't think popping will be a problem
right<00:04:06.840> now<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:07.260> least<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.620> me<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.420> does

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
right now at least for me but it does

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:18.830 
right now at least for me but it does
have<00:04:09.840> very<00:04:09.959> loose<00:04:10.200> tensions<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:18.359> yeah<00:04:18.510> guys<00:04:18.780> uh

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
have very loose tensions so yeah guys uh

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.380 
have very loose tensions so yeah guys uh
so<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.709> think<00:04:19.890> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> best<00:04:20.609> cube<00:04:20.970> right

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
so I think this is the best cube right

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.490 
so I think this is the best cube right
now<00:04:21.570> it's<00:04:22.520> it's<00:04:23.520> uh<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.020> lot<00:04:25.320> more

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
now it's it's uh I like it a lot more

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.050 
now it's it's uh I like it a lot more
than<00:04:25.560> string<00:04:25.950> show<00:04:26.160> some<00:04:26.760> people<00:04:27.000> were

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
probably for the shrimp show it kind of

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.370 
probably for the shrimp show it kind of

locks up it sometimes and it has a very
