that<00:00:42.540> sometimes<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.649> 55<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.640> there

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that sometimes around 55 here and there

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.139 
that sometimes around 55 here and there
but<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.960> usually<00:00:46.350> around<00:00:46.469> 60<00:00:47.190> FPS<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
but it's usually around 60 FPS and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.270 
but it's usually around 60 FPS and
usually<00:00:48.960> intense<00:00:49.260> fights<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:49.980> not

recording<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> lowest<00:00:52.199> i've<00:00:52.350> seen<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.860> 45

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399

FPS<00:00:54.110> which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.680> still<00:00:55.949> pretty<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:58.260> when

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
FPS which is still pretty good like when

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 
FPS which is still pretty good like when
it<00:00:58.500> starts<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.980> 30<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.489> grab<00:00:59.910> issues

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
it starts going to 30 then grab issues

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.630 
it starts going to 30 then grab issues
but<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:01.020> ever<00:01:01.530> goes<00:01:01.980> authority<00:01:02.430> i

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
but it really ever goes authority i

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
but it really ever goes authority i
barely<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.750> dirty<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.920> i'm<00:01:05.070> pretty

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
barely see it go dirty but i'm pretty

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
barely see it go dirty but i'm pretty
sure<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> same<00:01:06.119> clan<00:01:06.330> guys<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.750> 64<00:01:07.290> combo

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sure in the same clan guys like 64 combo

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
sure in the same clan guys like 64 combo
which<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
which is pretty good for I think it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
which is pretty good for I think it's
like<00:01:10.290> five<00:01:10.560> thugs<00:01:10.890> pretty<00:01:11.280> sure<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> wish<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
like five thugs pretty sure but I wish I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.870 
like five thugs pretty sure but I wish I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
got a next bench market hi guys in one

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
got a next bench market hi guys in one
bar<00:01:15.060> wonder<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.380> other

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
bar wonder well back to the other

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
bar wonder well back to the other
benchmark<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> dayz<00:01:17.610> standalone<00:01:18.259> just

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
benchmark this is dayz standalone just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.820 
benchmark this is dayz standalone just
came<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.299> here's<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> benchmarks<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.110> get

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
came out and here's the benchmarks I get

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.060 
came out and here's the benchmarks I get
around<00:01:22.950> 40<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> 50<00:01:23.939> FPS<00:01:24.619> enforced<00:01:25.619> his<00:01:25.770> games

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
around 40 to 50 FPS enforced his games

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
around 40 to 50 FPS enforced his games
done<00:01:26.250> awful<00:01:26.549> remember<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.119> an<00:01:27.240> alpha<00:01:27.479> guys

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
done awful remember it's an alpha guys

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
done awful remember it's an alpha guys
remember<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.860> cities<00:01:31.860> usually<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.280> 25

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
remember and and cities usually get 25

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.710 
remember and and cities usually get 25
the<00:01:33.060> 30<00:01:33.270> FPS<00:01:34.159> which<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.240> alpha<00:01:36.540> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the 30 FPS which it is an alpha so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.499 
the 30 FPS which it is an alpha so
hopefully<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.799> fix<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.299> get

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
hopefully they will fix it but let's get

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.740 
hopefully they will fix it but let's get
to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> next<00:01:39.900> benchmark<00:01:41.000> uh<00:01:42.000> here's<00:01:42.450> our<00:01:42.630> next

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to the next benchmark uh here's our next

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.069 
to the next benchmark uh here's our next
benchmark<00:01:43.409> battlefield<00:01:43.860> 4<00:01:44.930> with<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

benchmark<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.000> not

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
benchmark we got this is all not

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
benchmark we got this is all not
recording<00:01:48.930> move<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.220> rounded<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
recording move and also I rounded the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.690 
recording move and also I rounded the
number<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.380> does<00:01:52.680> amok<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.100> confusing<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
number so it does amok is confusing I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.709 
number so it does amok is confusing I
got<00:01:53.850> minimum<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.570> 25<00:01:55.020> FPS<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.549> rounded<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
got minimum of 25 FPS and I rounded the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.440 
got minimum of 25 FPS and I rounded the
40<00:01:58.200> FPS<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> average<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.240> at
