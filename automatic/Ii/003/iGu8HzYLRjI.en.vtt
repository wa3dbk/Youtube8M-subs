structure this season I felt for the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.470 
structure this season I felt for the
first<00:03:39.020> time<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.190> almost<00:03:40.640> had<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.940> character

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
first time that I almost had a character

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.500

or<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> muse<00:03:41.990> that<00:03:42.320> was<00:03:42.440> talking<00:03:42.830> back<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.250> me

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
or a muse that was talking back to me

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.250 
or a muse that was talking back to me
and<00:03:44.510> developing<00:03:45.080> her<00:03:45.560> own<00:03:45.710> identity<00:03:47.110> who<00:03:48.110> is

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
and developing her own identity who is

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.440 
and developing her own identity who is
she<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.890> good<00:03:49.070> question<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.970> guess<00:03:50.240> it's

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
she it's a good question I guess it's

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.630
