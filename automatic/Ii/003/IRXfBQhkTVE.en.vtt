hi I'm Jody Worrell today we're gonna
look<00:00:09.090> at<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> lick<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.990> use<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.230> work

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
look at a lick that we can use to work

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.629 
look at a lick that we can use to work
on<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.889> speed

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
on our speed

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.879 
on our speed
it<00:00:11.969> features<00:00:12.389> an<00:00:12.570> even<00:00:13.019> number<00:00:13.289> of<00:00:13.320> notes<00:00:13.620> per

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it features an even number of notes per

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
it features an even number of notes per
string<00:00:13.919> which<00:00:14.549> makes<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> picking<00:00:15.330> hands<00:00:15.570> job

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
string which makes the picking hands job

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:39.120 
string which makes the picking hands job
easier<00:00:16.410> let's<00:00:17.099> look<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.550> moveable<00:00:18.060> lick

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.110 

I'm<00:00:40.130> starting<00:00:40.730> on<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.910> 15th<00:00:41.330> fret<00:00:41.630> on<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
I'm starting on the 15th fret on the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.830 
I'm starting on the 15th fret on the
first<00:00:44.120> string<00:00:44.300> I'm<00:00:44.810> going<00:00:45.050> 15<00:00:45.560> 12<00:00:46.030> 15<00:00:47.030> 12<00:00:47.390> on

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
first string I'm going 15 12 15 12 on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.930 
first string I'm going 15 12 15 12 on
the<00:00:47.990> next<00:00:48.260> string<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.530> then<00:00:48.740> 14<00:00:49.190> 12<00:00:49.460> on<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the next string and then 14 12 on the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.760 
the next string and then 14 12 on the
third<00:00:50.210> string<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.059> do<00:00:53.150> three<00:00:53.690> strings<00:00:54.350> worth

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
third string so I do three strings worth

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.760 
third string so I do three strings worth
of<00:00:55.390> those<00:00:56.390> two<00:00:56.690> notes<00:00:56.930> per<00:00:57.050> string<00:00:57.200> it's<00:00:57.590> in

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
of those two notes per string it's in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.820 
of those two notes per string it's in
this<00:00:57.950> minor<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:58.940> G<00:00:59.630> major<00:00:59.870> pentatonic<00:01:00.020> or<00:01:00.680> a

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
this minor this G major pentatonic or a

minor pentatonic whichever you want to
look<00:01:02.540> at<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:05.380> so<00:01:06.380> 15<00:01:06.860> 12<00:01:07.160> 15<00:01:07.610> 12<00:01:07.880> 14<00:01:08.450> 12<00:01:08.750> on<00:01:09.020> 1<00:01:09.560> 2<00:01:10.130> &amp;

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
look at it so 15 12 15 12 14 12 on 1 2 &amp;

look at it so 15 12 15 12 14 12 on 1 2 &amp;
3<00:01:10.369> strings<00:01:10.970> then<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:12.259> back<00:01:12.500> up<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.860> string

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
3 strings then we just back up a string

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.890 
3 strings then we just back up a string
and<00:01:13.430> go<00:01:13.610> 15<00:01:14.180> 12<00:01:14.680> 14<00:01:15.680> 12<00:01:15.979> 14<00:01:16.640> 12<00:01:16.910> on<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.660> next

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
and go 15 12 14 12 14 12 on the next

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.230 
and go 15 12 14 12 14 12 on the next
three<00:01:18.050> things<00:01:18.350> three<00:01:19.070> strings<00:01:19.550> second<00:01:20.030> third

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
three things three strings second third

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the way to remember this is always when

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.380 
the way to remember this is always when
you<00:01:27.979> jump<00:01:28.280> back<00:01:28.490> up<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.970> next<00:01:29.180> higher

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
you jump back up to the next higher

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.210 
you jump back up to the next higher
string<00:01:29.720> just<00:01:29.930> do<00:01:30.020> exactly<00:01:30.440> what<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.770> did<00:01:31.009> on

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
it the first time back up to the third

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.550 
it the first time back up to the third
string<00:01:38.750> same<00:01:39.140> thing<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:39.470> played<00:01:39.679> 14<00:01:40.130> 12<00:01:41.350> 14<00:01:42.350> 12

string same thing we played 14 12 14 12
on<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.860> 4<00:01:43.069> 3<00:01:43.340> 14<00:01:44.240> 12<00:01:44.420> on<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.690> fifth<00:01:44.979> that

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
on the 4 3 14 12 on the fifth that

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.710 
on the 4 3 14 12 on the fifth that
little<00:01:46.310> part<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.759> is<00:01:46.970> completely

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
little part of it is completely

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:57.840 
little part of it is completely
symmetrical

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.030

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
then the last one is 1412

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.280 
then the last one is 1412
on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.760> fourth<00:02:02.060> 1412<00:02:02.900> on<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> fifth<00:02:04.960> 1512<00:02:05.960> on

the sixth Street and what you want to do

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.390 
the sixth Street and what you want to do
is<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.260> set<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.560> your<00:02:15.590> metronome<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.280> where

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
is just set up your metronome to where

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.940 
is just set up your metronome to where
it's<00:02:16.550> kind<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.760> taken<00:02:17.120> along<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.840> go

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.670 

and<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.190> always<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:23.170> downstroke<00:02:24.170> followed<00:02:24.560> by

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and it's always a downstroke followed by

uh never - of any either kind in a row

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.700 
uh never - of any either kind in a row
just<00:02:28.700> watch<00:02:28.910> my<00:02:29.090> right<00:02:29.210> hand<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.630> time<00:02:35.710> that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
just watch my right hand one time that

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.670 
just watch my right hand one time that
thing<00:02:36.980> stays<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.490> same<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:39.020> into<00:02:39.560> your

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
thing stays the same and just into your

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.180 
thing stays the same and just into your
metronome<00:02:39.980> up<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.320> could<00:02:42.470> start<00:02:42.710> off<00:02:42.890> and

accuracy is is key here we don't want to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.880 
accuracy is is key here we don't want to
take<00:02:47.420> something<00:02:47.870> that's<00:02:47.990> kind<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.350> sloppy<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
take something that's kind of sloppy and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.600 
take something that's kind of sloppy and
speed<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.520> make<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.790> fast<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.330> sloppy
