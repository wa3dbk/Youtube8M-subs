kind of bits and pieces from big to

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.090 
kind of bits and pieces from big to
small<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.229> next<00:02:07.440> bits<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> most

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
small so if you next bits the most

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.800 
small so if you next bits the most
exciting<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.240> when<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> popcorn

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
exciting because it's when the popcorn

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
exciting because it's when the popcorn
starts<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.590> come<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> life<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
starts to come to life so I just

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.990 
starts to come to life so I just
drizzled<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:13.050> my<00:02:13.350> melted<00:02:14.130> milk<00:02:14.370> chocolate<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
drizzled on my melted milk chocolate and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.330

white<00:02:15.450> chocolate<00:02:15.900> onto<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.620> popcorn<00:02:17.100> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
white chocolate onto the popcorn like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.290 
white chocolate onto the popcorn like
that<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.040> next<00:02:23.310> thing<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.760> did<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> just

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that so the next thing I did is just

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.870 
that so the next thing I did is just
