 those are the 23 players that we have 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.980
 to start this adventure 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.440
 the player who caused the most surprise in the 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.020
 list was carlos salcido who won 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.950
 the call for being a player 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.370
 multifunctional according to words from 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.860
 national technical 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.000
 salcido is a player that we do not need 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 prove it lack the respect of that quality 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.410
 it's something that a player does not deserve 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
 has a trajectory like that of sharp and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.520
 2 we do not need to prove it was 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.920
 just come observing it as 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.870
 we have observed the whole league and the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.570
 decision to bring Carlos has been 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.570
 because apart from that it is a game very very 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.130
 functional on the court as only 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.410
 gives us that possibility that with one 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.820
 we only have enough spaces but we 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.170
 bring it and say I'll see you I'll go 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.570
 to try there's nothing to try and know 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.710
 play at 5 san juan in 4 for de 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.280
 left lateral play from lateral 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.100
 right then 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 latest performances with tigers what 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.910
 they were being and of course what 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 means Carlos on the court that 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.290
 gold medal and all these 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.790
 circumstances well accentuated with the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.600
 technical body with another wall that was 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.360
 a very wise decision that we had 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.060
 now that there are 23 called for 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.860
 the louse is a clean slate 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.630
 everyone will have to earn their place at 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.650
 after the concentration starts 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 and in friendly games 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.230
 they all start from scratch 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.409
 they will earn it by working here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.659
 having determination attitude and the 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.890
 final decision will be borne by me 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.689
 person always always well supported by 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.030
 my people 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.849
 santiago diego or torruco the teacher are the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.739
 people in which I support 100% for 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.799
 to be able to make the final decision 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.620
 that falls entirely on my person but 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.900
 all start from scratch the competition goes 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.510
 to be the same for everyone to have the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.819
 same minutes in the previous matches 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.519
 get to the world 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.920
 on the other hand hector gonzález iñárritu 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.569
 assured that next May 28 in the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.239
 farewell game before israel 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.159
 cuauhtémoc blanco will receive a tribute and 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.700
 maybe I could play a few minutes with the 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:12.680
 tri with images of daniel games reported
