00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
being from Netgear I would expect a high

being from Netgear I would expect a high
level<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> build<00:01:06.689> quality<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.890> just

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
level of build quality and I really just

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.690 
level of build quality and I really just
don't<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
don't get it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
don't get it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
light so you know it doesn't weigh

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
light so you know it doesn't weigh
anything<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.460> feels

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
anything but you know it just feels

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.350 
anything but you know it just feels
cheap

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and you know that really disappoints me

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.560 
and you know that really disappoints me

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
especially as it's from Netgear and most

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.969 
especially as it's from Netgear and most
of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> products<00:01:18.960> I've<00:01:19.080> tested<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.619> their

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
of the products I've tested for their

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.920 
of the products I've tested for their
just<00:01:20.130> excellent<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.640> build<00:01:20.790> quality<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.689> next

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just excellent on build quality the next

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.300 
just excellent on build quality the next
one<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> fact<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> doesn't<00:01:23.040> properly

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
