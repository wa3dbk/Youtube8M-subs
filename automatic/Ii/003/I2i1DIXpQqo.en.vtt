once<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.560> your<00:00:19.680> midi<00:00:19.859> controller<00:00:20.220> set

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
once you have your midi controller set

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
once you have your midi controller set
up<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> preferences<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.539> start<00:00:21.869> MIDI

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
up in the preferences you can start MIDI

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
up in the preferences you can start MIDI
mapping<00:00:22.590> by<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.160> over<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> button<00:00:24.449> on

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
mapping by going over to this button on

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.810 
mapping by going over to this button on
the<00:00:24.720> top<00:00:24.960> right<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> program<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.580> says

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the top right of the program that says

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.179 
the top right of the program that says
MIDI<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.230> click<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> button<00:00:29.010> and

MIDI so we click on the button and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.589 
MIDI so we click on the button and
you'll<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> bunch<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> different

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you'll see that a bunch of the different

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
you'll see that a bunch of the different
options<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> software<00:00:32.070> turn<00:00:32.399> blue<00:00:32.730> all

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
options in the software turn blue all

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
options in the software turn blue all
the<00:00:33.719> functions<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.620> highlighted<00:00:34.980> in

the functions that are highlighted in
blue<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.520> mini<00:00:35.790> mappable<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.540> means<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
blue are mini mappable that means that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
blue are mini mappable that means that
you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.230> assign<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> control<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.510> your

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
you can assign them to a control on your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
you can assign them to a control on your
MIDI<00:00:39.870> controller<00:00:40.730> you'll<00:00:41.730> also<00:00:41.879> notice<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
MIDI controller you'll also notice that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.510 
MIDI controller you'll also notice that
we<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.719> new<00:00:42.989> pane<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> left<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we have a new pane on the left and that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
we have a new pane on the left and that
is<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.940> midi<00:00:45.210> mappings<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:46.860> all

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is for midi mappings this is where all

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
is for midi mappings this is where all
of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.309> different<00:00:47.579> midi<00:00:47.730> mappings<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.360> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
of the different midi mappings will be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
of the different midi mappings will be
stored<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> you'll<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.739> able<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> customize

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
stored and you'll be able to customize

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
stored and you'll be able to customize
some<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> mini<00:00:51.570> mappings<00:00:52.020> depending<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
some of the mini mappings depending on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.400 
some of the mini mappings depending on
what<00:00:53.010> function<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.699> trying<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> map<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> if

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
what function you're trying to map so if

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.889 
what function you're trying to map so if
we<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.920> map<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.550> button<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.300> example<00:00:57.719> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
we want to map a button for example this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.349 
we want to map a button for example this

my<00:01:06.600> midi<00:01:06.990> controller<00:01:08.090> you'll<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.960> now

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
my midi controller you'll see that now

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.700 
my midi controller you'll see that now
next<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> button<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> says<00:01:12.020> which<00:01:13.020> MIDI

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
next to the button it says which MIDI

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
next to the button it says which MIDI
channel<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:15.000> MIDI<00:01:15.330> note<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.080> assigned

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
channel and what MIDI note is assigned

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.190 
channel and what MIDI note is assigned
and<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.310> shows<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.759> directly<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.840> button

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and it shows it directly on the button

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.940 
and it shows it directly on the button
itself<00:01:20.060> you'll<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.259> MIDI

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
itself you'll also see that the MIDI

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.420 
itself you'll also see that the MIDI
mapping<00:01:23.490> pain<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> new<00:01:24.570> entry<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
mapping pain has a new entry and that is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.620 
mapping pain has a new entry and that is
for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.140> MIDI<00:01:28.140> control<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.040> signed

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
for the MIDI control that I just signed

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
for the MIDI control that I just signed
now<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> simple<00:01:31.170> button<00:01:31.439> doesn't<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> lot

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
now a simple button doesn't have a lot

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
now a simple button doesn't have a lot
of<00:01:32.070> options<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.390> trying<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> map

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
of options but if you are trying to map

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
of options but if you are trying to map
something<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> fader<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.180> some

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
something like a fader you get some

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
something like a fader you get some
additional<00:01:36.659> options<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.250> I'll<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> I'll

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
additional options so I'll go and I'll

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
additional options so I'll go and I'll
click<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.540> line<00:01:39.810> fader<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:41.340> I'm

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
click on this line fader here then I'm

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
click on this line fader here then I'm
just<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> move<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.210> control<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.110> midi

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
just going to move a control on my midi

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
just going to move a control on my midi
controller<00:01:43.909> once<00:01:44.909> again<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> new

controller once again we have a new

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
controller once again we have a new
entry<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.829> middle<00:01:47.100> mappings<00:01:47.579> pain<00:01:47.909> but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
entry in the middle mappings pain but

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.560 
entry in the middle mappings pain but
this<00:01:48.509> time<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.740> minimum<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> maximum

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
this time we have a minimum and maximum

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.550 
this time we have a minimum and maximum
value<00:01:52.009> right<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> minimum<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.970> set<00:01:54.270> to

something like a fader or an EQ you can

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.070

you<00:03:01.630> can<00:03:01.810> mini-map<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.620> than<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
you can mini-map more than just the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.670 
you can mini-map more than just the
standard<00:03:04.209> controls<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.170> find<00:03:05.410> on

standard controls that you find on

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.920 
standard controls that you find on
channels<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.820> also<00:03:06.940> map<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.690> about

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
channels you can also map just about

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.930 
channels you can also map just about
anything<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.340> add<00:03:09.520> an<00:03:09.820> effect

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
anything so if we go and add an effect

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.440 
anything so if we go and add an effect
like<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:11.350> auto<00:03:12.010> filter<00:03:12.489> for<00:03:12.700> example<00:03:13.090> I'll<00:03:13.239> just

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
like a auto filter for example I'll just

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.070 
like a auto filter for example I'll just
drop<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.870> onto<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:15.070> channel<00:03:15.520> then<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.930> go

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
drop it onto a channel then I can go

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.080 
drop it onto a channel then I can go
back<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.350> mini<00:03:17.769> mode<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.340> you'll<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:18.940> that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
back to mini mode and you'll see that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.270 
back to mini mode and you'll see that
all<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.780> effect<00:03:20.320> controls<00:03:20.500> are<00:03:21.040> also

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
all of the effect controls are also

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.640 
all of the effect controls are also
assignable<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.260> want<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.470> assign

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
assignable so we want to assign

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
assignable so we want to assign
something<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.280> frequency<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.269> also

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
something like the frequency I can also

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.220 
something like the frequency I can also
do<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:27.000> add<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> mini<00:03:28.239> map<00:03:28.450> mode<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.959> now<00:03:29.170> you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
do so add a mini map mode and now you

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.890 
do so add a mini map mode and now you
can<00:03:29.470> see<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.650> can<00:03:29.769> adjust<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.910> frequency<00:03:31.330> on

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
can see I can adjust the frequency on

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.620 
can see I can adjust the frequency on
this<00:03:32.080> filter<00:03:32.580> almost<00:03:33.580> all<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.090> able<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.420> live

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.090
