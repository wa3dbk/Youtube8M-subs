00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.480
 fourth row doing a lift loop and 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.630
 tying the next loop column without 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 Nakida further cooking for 1 air loops 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.570
 I knit a column without nakid further following 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.590
 2 loops I see one column without 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 nakida in an arch column without nakida that is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.369
 I knit the whole row with columns 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 nakida where my loops knit but in 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.329
 knit loop stitching a gift knit 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.399
 one column without nakida that is 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.000
 so here are the two loops in them 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.050
 I knit one column without nakida 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.879
 I also knit a single crochet 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 here, too, nothing complicated 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:59.449
 repeat again this way knitting up 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.160
 end of the series at the end of a number of body 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.299
 connecting bar it will be 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.439
 fourth row further I will knit 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 I tie to the end at the end of the row 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.210
 connecting stub in general should 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.320
 look like this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.439
 fourth row 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.640
 I will repeat this and this series two more times. 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.290
 if you want to be wider 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.259
 accordingly you can repeat not 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 another 2 1 that is only three times up to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.000
 several more times already accordingly 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 tie once or twice 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 these two rows, that is, we are looking at 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.130
 discretion i will tie up and on how you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 want how wide from must be 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 This strip is best of course 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.369
 determine fitting 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.670
 visible narrower and make or more 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.140
 broad in general I repeat once again 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.259
 I wrap it this way it does it twice 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.259
 there are 3 4 row repeat two more times
