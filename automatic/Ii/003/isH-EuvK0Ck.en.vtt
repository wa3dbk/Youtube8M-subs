 about a weapon that is an authentic 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.370
 outrageous because it is certainly up to 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.100
 Today the best weapon personally 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.050
 and it's about the repair that just 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.150
 today it has been introduced in the multiplayer 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.490
 of golf but only for 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.830
 xbox users and exclusively for 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.379
 the people who have acquired the base 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.730
 of season or season pass likewise 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.550
 I bring all the most relevant details 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.380
 of the totally new of ls number 2 that 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.329
 is about to come out as always 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.800
 remember that you liked it or you can 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.750
 help make sure you click on the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.220
 button I like and share the video with 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.010
 your friends to be able to keep bringing 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.410
 incredible call of dutty videos like this 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.300
 as not guys this exclusive new weapon 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.149
 let's say it's a preview of what 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.640
 will be the dlc number 2 called deva 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.579
 station or devastation which will include 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.770
 four new maps of small sizes and 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.750
 medium a new weapon that is basically 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.329
 the one they're looking at in the background 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.260
 gameplay that is the ripert of which they 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.260
 I will talk a lot 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.850
 more in just a minute and last and 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.670
 I believe that what attracts me most about this 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.440
 dlc is the second extension chapter 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.870
 which it is a game mode in 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.240
 I love more and I can not 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.860
 It promises a lot but focusing more 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.050
 in the new weapon that as I already know 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.000
 I mentioned is an exclusive advance for 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.680
 those who bought the season pass for 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.930
 try this gun and see what a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.150
 authentic mini monster this weapon because 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.310
 despite being very small is very much 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.170
 better than any other submachine gun and for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 if it was not enough, it is also a 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.340
 hybrid weapon this is that with just 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.590
 press the left joystick of our 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.540
 control will be raised a look that what 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 What it will do is turn it into a rifle 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 assault on this repair styled guys 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.750
 I was doing a while 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.040
 livestream on my channel tweet which 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 you can check in the description of this 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.760
 video and follow me on that channel if you like 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.280
 since out there I'll be doing like they're 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.620
 almost daily and especially playing with their 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.180
 followers so just in the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.070
 lectern was playing with 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.750
 several of you and of course I was 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.760
 testing this weapon and the truth is that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.340
 I literally fell in love because it's a 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.260
 super versatile weapon very over powered 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.420
 because they have nothing recoil 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.549
 and it has a tremendous cadence as its 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.980
 rifle which in turn is reduced a bit 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.870
 this cadence to become a rifle 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.340
 of assault I was even seeing that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.079
 many players were using this 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.329
 weapon to change as you reflect aldo 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.030
 because it's just a weapon too 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.340
 opic or rather about power gives 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.620
 as much as his craft as a rifle 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.239
 Personally the assault I'm using a 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.220
 very good time in the live stream and 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 later on my part and the truth 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.370
 is that with this weapon I was winning 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.409
 practically any body body of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.120
 a very simple way was also 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.220
 doing a tremendous slaughter in each 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.750
 departure because the way in which the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.459
 I wore that I think is the best 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.870
 combination so far because 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.700
 basically what I put in the gun 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.099
 were the loaders extended or 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.930
 extended max and the muzzle brake that the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.940
 truth is a barbarity how powerful 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.340
 is this weapon and above all the precise 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.379
 even like his rifle that is like more me 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.940
 I like to take it and I tell them it does not move 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.120
 practically nothing and has a scope 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.010
 tremendous even using it as his rifle 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.959
 now guys going to how it's used 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.180
 this weapon and some details of it 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.310
 we see that it has a folding look that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.989
 is what I told you that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.830
 when the gaze rises, it becomes 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.480
 an assault rifle 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.610
 and even at the bottom of the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 peephole has some letters that indicate you 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.190
 if the weapon is being used as smg or 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.390
 be like your rifle or as an assault rifle 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.160
 shooting to notice the change in the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.080
 cadence of which he talked to his 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.390
 moment when you look up 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.000
 this cadence decreases making 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.930
 this weapon is still much more accurate and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.760
 mostly lethal 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.530
 so certainly it is becoming 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.480
 my favorite weapon for everything that I have 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.550
 commented above and good guys 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.380
 additionally we have that mobility 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.060
 in this weapon is tremendous 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.700
 we do not need the prc o at all 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.590
 advantage of hunter or stoker since at 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.720
 be a submachine gun we have a great 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.430
 mobility and you could believe that this 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.380
 weapon by becoming a rifle 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 assault could diminish a little the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.920
 mobility with the weapon but how to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.630
 appreciates there is no decrease in the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.150
 mobility even with this weapon 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.740
 turned into an assault rifle so 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.020
 good guys if you have the possibility of 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.359
 acquire the season pass or simply the 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.519
 base station dlc is definitely 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.440
 a great option since it improves a lot 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.600
 the experience in the game and you have 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.760
 access to more and better things in the call 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.500
 of duty ghosts that has been all for this 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.550
 video guys but thank you very much for 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.349
 watch the video 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.870

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:35.159

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.159
