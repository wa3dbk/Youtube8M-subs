00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 So let's start with the first 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 activity the game inspired the idea 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.170
 of a fungus came about when breeders 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.140
 revelation fans watched the series of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.450
 documentaries planet earth in the bbc and one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.240
 of the episodes deals precisely with the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 ants turned into zombies thanks 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.770
 cerebral infection caused by it no 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.259
 a secret in uncharted game 3 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.470
 naughty dog ​​studio responsible for 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.710
 game was relatively small and always 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 produced one game at a time and was 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 front was however developed in 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.710
 secret and simultaneously to the other 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.689
 company success uncharted 3 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.600
 there was a leak during the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.210
 development of sensitive information 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.670
 almost leaked more than once 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 the most curious episode occurred when the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.909
 director thousand joke forgot his full ipad 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.240
 information about the game on an airplane by 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.810
 lucky nobody saw the device and it works 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.729
 he also there is an uncharted quote 3 to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
 a reference from the game of lessa franz 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.840
 hidden in the game an extended newspaper 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.640
 on the table of a bar 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.009
 you can read a title from a story 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.660
 about a strange and deadly infection 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.600
 caused by a thread 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.660
 the scientists failed to understand the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.870
 the first clip created for the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.780
 The game predicted that instead of being good 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.600
 character would assume the role of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.150
 villain betrayed per day or the protagonist of the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.000
 She would try maps but she would 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.790
 prevented by the prominent assistant 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.940
 in velletri fans for talking about l 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.040
 the girl is responsible for another quote 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.620
 when she tries to learn to whistle 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.470
 play number she produces the theme song of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.020
 uncharted technology of honoring saying 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.510
 that that melody troubles him is he 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.480
 Reminds you of Canadian actress Ellen 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.390
 page of the game bião shows 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.860
 the similarity is so evident that it asks 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.890
 publicly accused the dog of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.360
 Plagiarism maybe I should feel 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.210
 flattered in 2013 but I do not like it 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.630
 Another curiosity is that the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.460
 marketing team of the new drug 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.920
 has warned of the fact that games with 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.750
 woman in the animal cape just that anyway 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 producers decided that it would be the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.770
 character of the study 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.680
 instead of commercial failure of the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.110
 result was an absurd success and a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.050
 of the best playstation 3 games of 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.470
 all times two numbers what 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.040
 appear in the game should be fictitious 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.750
 but they were from dial-sex services 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.360
 anori dog was justified by saying that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
 had made a mistake in the direction of 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.709
 art 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.420
 soon after an update disappeared with the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.270
 moments here beauty 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.400
 the soundtrack had a winner 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.140
 Oscar the Argentine musician and composer 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.720
 gustavo santa olalla he took it home 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.640
