00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.420
 presented as the citroën sm 1970 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.820
 would appear like a car of one 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.099
 There has never been such a star in any other star 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 front and the page line defined the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.189
 Concept aerodynamics completely new yet 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.840
 more extraordinary is the heart of the sm 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.940
 a thoroughbred maserati v6 with 170 ps 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.940
 accelerates the car to 225 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370
 thus the sm accelerated the pulse 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 many of his contemporaries also from georg 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.309
 Johann Dusseldorfer bought his 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.430
 sm 1971 the former hobby racer 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.190
 has already over 250,000 kilometers with the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 citroën maserati still unpacked today 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 he is his first choice 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.940
 also in long distance in connection with 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.550
 the v6 and hydro pneumatics defined 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.159
 sm the term gran tourisme completely 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.110
 new for the 70s completely 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.560
 unusual car for many in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.810
 Germany nevertheless only 971 buyers the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.810
 but were and are completely thrilled 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.980
 I've got an idea about it before 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.730
 from the beginning to the 23 models 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.290
 hazards 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.370
 then this car came with this 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.430
 six-cylinder engine like me the car 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.570
 have driven and have on the day of the test 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.570
 Test drive bought 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.979
 show 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.740
 Yes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.790
 again 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.470
 the pending sm polarized for the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 One was the most advanced car 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.940
 his time the others found him 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.950
 Underpowered who today a good 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.100
 copy wants to have a long search 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.980
 and pay a lot 1 2 plus candidate 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.740
 Rangers between 20 and 25 thousand euros 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.780
 late 80s and early 90s 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.100
 stood the French beauty 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.020
 a flatfoot at 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.640
 used car dealer was simple 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.560
 unsalable and rotten as exotic 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.790
 but then, as now, the sm is one 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.860
 rare eye catcher 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.020
 above all, the interior contributes to this 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.090
 here dominate the oval shaped 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.430
 round instruments in combination with 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.400
 aware of the seats on the plane 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.860
 cockpits should remember just 260 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.290
 copies still glide through germany 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.209
 the once fastest salon in the world 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.860
 but also had significant weakening before 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.140
 In all , he is one for four adults 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.520
 a bit tight that disappointed and helps 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.520
 many from a purchase 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.209
 But the biggest selling brake was 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.879
 just the Italian heart of 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.819
 engine was considered too rough and much worse 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.560
 as unreliable rows flew the 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.170
 Own the sticks around the ears 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.000
 which does not have to be if you have a sm 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:32.140
 specialists like the neusser follow 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:32.860
 Hammer on the sensitive engine allows 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.530
 repair 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.120
 good at fixing this problem 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.329
 The whole story is the sticks 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.400
 They are on the cylinder head over a 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.930
 mechanical tensioner re-tensioned the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 So that means that the engineer is in demand 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.760
 that must be done regularly otherwise 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.849
 Bring chains over and engine damage is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.340
 the episode with such a conscientious 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.420
 wars are the italian motors 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.629
 It was definitely true that applies to the 170th 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.859
 ps strong carburetor as for the 8 ps 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.859
 stronger a splash 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.630
 here are the mileage of 200 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.740
 250,000 actually no problem though 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.480
 requirement is the regular 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.880
 maintenance and the corresponding 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.209
 repairs it remains a prima donna in 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.690
 euro cost body as robust showed 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.550
 the sm in the rally morocco 1971 three 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.570
 days and two nights he fought 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.850
 largely sm series left against 58 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.950
 competitor citroen stepped on the whole 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.900
 The reliability of the engine is a given 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.880
 to demonstrate and the incredible 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.940
 To show suspension in top performance 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.980
 it sets citroën much for the match a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.830
 failure before the eyes of the specialist press 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.510
 would have been catastrophic 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:54.540
 in the end it went well 9 did the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.600
 complete distance and the sm won the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.950
 sm so reliable for georg 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.260
 johannes no question 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.720
 he still drives his 71er today 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.640
 the highway mercilessly downright 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.680
 more distant business appointments 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.350
 in easy 500 kilometer easy route 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.930
 Cost comes with the French diva 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.830
 the choir of italians to use and that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.830
 no ifs and buts 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.509
 if it has been properly maintained when 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.879
 one exchanges the parts from the same 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.009
 are subject to wear then that is 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.840
 car today fully operational and there 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.159
 There is no reason not to use it that way 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.789
 how you always made it as always 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.639
 has made 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.189
 how hot full throttle and the 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.719
 acceleration from 0 to 100 in 10 3 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.669
 savor seconds 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.919
 But please only with a good workshop 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.749
 in the back they are actually with the 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.289
 citroen hurt and the capricious 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:48.939
 motor knows about five of them like to 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.339
 example succession hammels there in 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.050
 germany, however, was itself a new car 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:59.189
 the amalgamation citroën maserati 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:02.589
 problematic do not wait 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:04.659
 details about the engine was missing setting data 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.849
 at all engine data repair 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.419
 documents were actually getting much better 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.159
 late enlightenment was also much too late 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.810
 done so so then the 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.969
 Vehicles already under it 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.580
 had suffered 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.689
 Many people changed that as well 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.300
 Special versions like the only two times 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.580
 built it a president of the nothing 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.979
 Rather ruined faster than blessing 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.659
 from the top came the overburdened 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.430
 Workshops failed with the 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:35.409
 highest consecration and praise started 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.750
 citroen sm and that he lands after only 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.599
 six years and not quite 13,000

 copy in the after the citroen 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.740
 peugeot passed over 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.469
 but not only the maintenance 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.379
 difficulties troubled him 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:54.759
 but also his then technical 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:56.969
 innovations the comfortable oneself 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.599
 Back steering was considered too 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:01.089
 getting used to it 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.789

 at the time leading computer on board 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.360
 dismissed as plaything 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:12.849
 the high price compared to the porsche 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.180
 and co , the msm finally became the 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.180
 disastrous 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.930
 the car from the other star the sensation 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.080
 disappeared from 1970 and became the

 legend
