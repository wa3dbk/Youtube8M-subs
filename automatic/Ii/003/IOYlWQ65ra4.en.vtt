00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of the stroke and so on so if let's say

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.170 
of the stroke and so on so if let's say
we<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:05.100> working<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.479> opacity<00:01:06.900> slider<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
we are working on the opacity slider and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.630 
we are working on the opacity slider and
we<00:01:09.180> choose<00:01:09.510> 10<00:01:10.170> steps<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
we choose 10 steps and we have the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
we choose 10 steps and we have the
opacity<00:01:16.729> 20<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.210> opacity<00:01:18.509> slider<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:20.310> means

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
opacity 20 the opacity slider that means

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.950 
opacity 20 the opacity slider that means
that<00:01:20.759> first<00:01:21.659> 10<00:01:22.189> shapes<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.060> stroke<00:01:24.659> are

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that first 10 shapes of the stroke are
