I'll show you exactly how I do it I've

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.710 
I'll show you exactly how I do it I've
got<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.750> my<00:02:34.870> tip<00:02:35.080> ups<00:02:35.260> fooled<00:02:35.590> up<00:02:35.800> with

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
got my and my tip ups fooled up with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.870 
got my and my tip ups fooled up with
80-pound<00:02:37.720> background<00:02:38.530> line<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:39.760> I'm

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
80-pound background line and then I'm

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.440 
80-pound background line and then I'm
using<00:02:40.290> an<00:02:41.290> 50<00:02:42.220> or<00:02:42.370> 60<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> think<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.090> 60

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
using an 50 or 60 I think it's a 60

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.170 
using an 50 or 60 I think it's a 60
pound<00:02:43.680> fluorocarbon<00:02:44.680> leader<00:02:45.310> that's<00:02:45.910> 10

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
pound fluorocarbon leader that's 10

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.810 
pound fluorocarbon leader that's 10
inches<00:02:46.300> long<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:47.430> fluorocarbon<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.700> my

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
inches long here fluorocarbon in my

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.910 
inches long here fluorocarbon in my
opinion<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.360> best<00:02:49.600> leader<00:02:50.440> material

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
opinion is the best leader material

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.590 
opinion is the best leader material
because<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.220> super<00:02:51.610> clear<00:02:51.880> underwater<00:02:52.360> but

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
because it's super clear underwater but

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600 
because it's super clear underwater but
it's<00:02:52.720> also<00:02:52.870> really<00:02:53.260> resistant<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.950> teeth<00:02:54.160> so

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's also really resistant to teeth so

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.640 
it's also really resistant to teeth so
that<00:02:54.640> 60<00:02:55.180> pound<00:02:55.360> fluorocarbon<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.110> an<00:02:56.200> awesome

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that 60 pound fluorocarbon is an awesome

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.850 
that 60 pound fluorocarbon is an awesome
leader<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.160> then<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.700> also<00:02:57.880> put<00:02:58.829> usually<00:02:59.829> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
leader and then I also put usually a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.560 
leader and then I also put usually a
little<00:03:00.040> bead<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.670> tiny<00:03:00.880> little<00:03:01.060> blade<00:03:01.360> on

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
little bead and a tiny little blade on

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.880 
little bead and a tiny little blade on
there<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.140> little<00:03:02.260> added<00:03:02.470> attraction

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
there just for a little added attraction

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.160 
there just for a little added attraction
especially<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.850> murky<00:03:04.239> water<00:03:04.510> this

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
especially in this murky water this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.020 
especially in this murky water this
chartreuse<00:03:06.100> bead<00:03:06.370> seems<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.850> work<00:03:07.000> pretty

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
chartreuse bead seems to work pretty

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.330 
chartreuse bead seems to work pretty
good<00:03:07.299> so<00:03:08.079> since<00:03:08.500> we're<00:03:08.650> only<00:03:08.709> fishing<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
good so since we're only fishing in a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.030 
good so since we're only fishing in a
couple<00:03:09.670> feet<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.850> water<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:11.560> only<00:03:11.799> letting

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
couple feet of water I'm only letting

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.770 
couple feet of water I'm only letting
out<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.549> bit<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.880> line<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.329> early<00:03:13.630> ice

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
sometimes is instead of just hooking in

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.199 
sometimes is instead of just hooking in
in<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.340> back<00:03:38.549> by<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.849> dorsal<00:03:39.359> fin<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:40.560> can

in the back by the dorsal fin you can

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.000 
in the back by the dorsal fin you can
come<00:03:42.209> on<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.359> side<00:03:42.719> here<00:03:43.140> use<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:43.739> hook

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
the weight of the hook will constantly

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.009 
the weight of the hook will constantly
be<00:04:03.810> trying<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.230> turn<00:04:04.470> him<00:04:04.709> upside<00:04:04.829> down<00:04:05.159> and

be trying to turn him upside down and

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.030 
be trying to turn him upside down and
since<00:04:07.019> they<00:04:07.139> don't<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.439> to<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.829> upside

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040

down<00:04:08.220> they're<00:04:08.549> gonna<00:04:08.609> be<00:04:08.790> always<00:04:08.939> fighting

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
down they're gonna be always fighting

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.729 
down they're gonna be always fighting
against<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> weight<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.230> hook<00:04:10.439> to<00:04:10.620> keep

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
against the weight of that hook to keep

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.530 
against the weight of that hook to keep
themselves<00:04:10.950> right-side<00:04:11.579> up<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.209> that's<00:04:12.329> just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
themselves right-side up so that's just

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.879 
themselves right-side up so that's just
a<00:04:12.689> way<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.840> keep<00:04:13.139> your<00:04:13.230> minnows<00:04:13.500> swimming

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
a way to keep your minnows swimming

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.890 
a way to keep your minnows swimming
instead<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.819> just<00:04:15.000> getting<00:04:15.180> docile<00:04:15.720> under

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
instead of just getting docile under

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.520 
instead of just getting docile under
