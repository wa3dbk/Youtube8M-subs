what's<00:00:11.969> up<00:00:12.150> guys<00:00:12.330> joy<00:00:12.660> continental

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
what's up guys joy continental

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.480 
what's up guys joy continental
Federation<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.949> get<00:00:14.070> out<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.279> the<00:00:14.369> map

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
Federation is how to get out of the map

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.369 
Federation is how to get out of the map
acting<00:00:15.059> along<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.959> couple<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.170> sky

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
acting along with a couple of sky

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
acting along with a couple of sky
barriers<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> pretty<00:00:18.029> cool<00:00:18.330> glitch

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
barriers so this is a pretty cool glitch

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.350 
barriers so this is a pretty cool glitch
not<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.200> difficult<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.910> want<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
not that difficult so you want to have a

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.000 
not that difficult so you want to have a
counter-strike<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:22.530> of<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.740> that's<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
counter-strike first of all that's the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.470 
counter-strike first of all that's the
first<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.280> you<00:00:23.430> want<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.730> now<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
first thing you want to do now it's

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.970 
first thing you want to do now it's
probably<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> juggernaut<00:00:25.230> isn't<00:00:25.560> necessary

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
probably the juggernaut isn't necessary

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
probably the juggernaut isn't necessary
but<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.310> figured<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.020> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
but I figured that if you got to get a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.300 
but I figured that if you got to get a
20<00:00:28.350> killstreak<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.770> might<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
20 killstreak you might as well have the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
20 killstreak you might as well have the
juggernaut<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> test

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
juggernaut on this way you can do a test

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.720 
juggernaut on this way you can do a test
one<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.830> carbon<00:00:32.129> balls<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> do

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
one like carbon balls is going to do

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.220 
one like carbon balls is going to do
which<00:00:32.910> I'll<00:00:33.210> explain<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.199> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
which I'll explain in a second what I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
which I'll explain in a second what I
mean<00:00:34.409> by<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.699> so<00:00:35.699> you're<00:00:35.789> going<00:00:35.879> to<00:00:35.969> line<00:00:36.120> up

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
mean by that so you're going to line up

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.939 
mean by that so you're going to line up
like<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.659> and<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.499> a<00:00:37.530> knife<00:00:37.739> lunge

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
like this and just do a knife lunge

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.680 
like this and just do a knife lunge
without<00:00:38.309> calling<00:00:38.670> comic<00:00:38.999> strick<00:00:39.149> first<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
without calling comic strick first and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.779 
without calling comic strick first and
this<00:00:40.530> way<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.129> make<00:00:41.339> sure<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.640> actually

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
this way you make sure you're actually

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.880 
this way you make sure you're actually
in<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> lunging<00:00:42.449> you<00:00:42.539> don't<00:00:42.719> fuck<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.079> once

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
in a lunging you don't fuck up once

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.049 
in a lunging you don't fuck up once
you're<00:00:44.100> confident<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> had<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.819> lunge

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you're confident that you had to lunge

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
you're confident that you had to lunge
arm<00:00:45.589> lined<00:00:46.589> up<00:00:46.769> properly<00:00:46.949> then<00:00:47.339> you<00:00:47.429> can<00:00:47.579> call

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
arm lined up properly then you can call

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
arm lined up properly then you can call
in<00:00:47.909> your<00:00:48.030> cum<00:00:48.149> strike<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:49.069> the<00:00:50.069> time<00:00:50.249> for<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
in your cum strike and the time for this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.829 
in your cum strike and the time for this
is<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.729> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.059> tricky<00:00:51.359> but<00:00:51.479> basically

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
is a little bit tricky but basically

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.889 
is a little bit tricky but basically
raised<00:00:52.139> the<00:00:52.350> bomb<00:00:52.499> explodes<00:00:53.089> or<00:00:54.089> like<00:00:54.569> two

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
raised the bomb explodes or like two

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.079 
raised the bomb explodes or like two
seconds<00:00:55.229> at<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> bomb<00:00:55.649> explodes<00:00:56.069> like<00:00:56.309> right

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
seconds at the bomb explodes like right

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.119 
seconds at the bomb explodes like right
right<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:57.569> is<00:00:57.749> when<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.929> get<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.079> knife<00:00:58.260> just

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
right now is when you get a knife just

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
right now is when you get a knife just
practice<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.670> eventually<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> timing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
practice and eventually get the timing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
practice and eventually get the timing
if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.139> it<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.499> go<00:01:01.859> flying

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
if you do it right you go flying

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
if you do it right you go flying
ridiculously<00:01:03.239> high<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> landing<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
ridiculously high and landing this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.039 
ridiculously high and landing this
barrier<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.689> once<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
barrier right here once you're on this

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.510 
barrier right here once you're on this
barrier<00:01:07.469> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.009> tricky<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> land

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
barrier is a little bit tricky to land

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.069 
barrier is a little bit tricky to land
on<00:01:08.610> by<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.789> way<00:01:08.969> so<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.329> don't<00:01:09.539> get<00:01:09.689> first

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
on by the way so if you don't get first

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.190 
on by the way so if you don't get first
couple<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:11.219> keep<00:01:11.369> trying<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
couple times just keep trying and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.330 
couple times just keep trying and
practicing<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.649> anyways<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.280> you're

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
practicing but anyways from here you're

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.730 
practicing but anyways from here you're
going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> strafe<00:01:14.820> jump<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.360> little

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to strafe jump to this little

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.709 
going to strafe jump to this little
barrier<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.969> also<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.329> on<00:01:21.479> top<00:01:21.689> of

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
barrier here you can also get on top of

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.120 
barrier here you can also get on top of
the<00:01:21.899> gas<00:01:22.049> station<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> actual<00:01:22.890> metal

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the gas station like on the actual metal

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
the gas station like on the actual metal
parts<00:01:23.520> anyways<00:01:24.359> familiar<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:24.960> strafe

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
parts anyways familiar going to strafe

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
parts anyways familiar going to strafe
jump<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.619> building<00:01:28.460> now<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:29.609> still

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
jump to this building now we're still

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
jump to this building now we're still
finding<00:01:30.090> parts<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:30.630> glitch<00:01:30.869> um<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:32.009> spent

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
finding parts of this glitch um we spent

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.740 
finding parts of this glitch um we spent
probably<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.939> three<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.539> four<00:01:33.570> hours

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
probably a thing three or four hours

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.160 
probably a thing three or four hours
doing<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.570> we<00:01:36.570> found<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.899> out<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.109> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
doing this and we found it out of the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
doing this and we found it out of the
map<00:01:37.320> found<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> couple<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.340> spots<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.149> we're

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
map found a couple other spots but we're

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.240 
map found a couple other spots but we're
still<00:01:40.049> working<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.469> it<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.829> anyways<00:01:41.130> from

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
still working on it but anyways from

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
still working on it but anyways from
here<00:01:41.369> you're<00:01:41.429> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.609> slowly<00:01:41.820> walk<00:01:42.149> off<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
here you're going to slowly walk off to

getting<00:02:16.110> really<00:02:16.380> far<00:02:16.560> out<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:18.510> time<00:02:18.840> will

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
getting really far out but in time will

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.630 
getting really far out but in time will
eventually<00:02:19.470> underst<00:02:19.709> will<00:02:19.980> bungee<00:02:20.190> find<00:02:20.580> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
eventually underst will bungee find a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
way to get past the big barriers and get

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
way to get past the big barriers and get
way<00:02:22.500> outside<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.890> map<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.180> figure
