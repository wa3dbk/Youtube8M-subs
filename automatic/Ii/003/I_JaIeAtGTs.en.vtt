sold it from the back and what I did was

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.190 
sold it from the back and what I did was
if<00:03:46.250> anybody<00:03:46.609> knows<00:03:46.819> how<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:47.000> sew<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:48.019> go

if anybody knows how to sew you go
forward<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.040> then<00:03:49.159> there's<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:49.639> button

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
forward and then there's a little button

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.580 
forward and then there's a little button
that<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.540> press<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.109> kind<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.319> like<00:03:51.439> goes

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
that you press and it kind of like goes

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.830 
that you press and it kind of like goes
backwards<00:03:52.159> and<00:03:52.400> then<00:03:52.939> you<00:03:53.060> go<00:03:53.180> forward<00:03:53.450> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
backwards and then you go forward and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.610 
backwards and then you go forward and
backwards<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.799> kind<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.129> like<00:03:56.620> concrete's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
backwards so it kind of like concrete's

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.069 
backwards so it kind of like concrete's
are<00:03:57.769> solidifies<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.670> fortifies<00:03:59.120> your<00:03:59.750> stitch

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
backwards like three or four times I

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.699 
backwards like three or four times I
don't<00:04:05.150> know<00:04:05.329> because<00:04:05.510> I'm<00:04:05.629> a<00:04:05.660> little<00:04:05.930> anal<00:04:06.109> and

don't know because I'm a little anal and

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.559 
don't know because I'm a little anal and
I<00:04:06.829> wanted<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.099> make<00:04:07.220> sure<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.269> and

I wanted to make sure that was there and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.890 
I wanted to make sure that was there and
then<00:04:09.109> I<00:04:09.440> just<00:04:09.650> follow<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.760> line<00:04:11.000> with<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
then I just follow the line with the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.259 
then I just follow the line with the
pins<00:04:12.199> and<00:04:12.590> then<00:04:13.129> right<00:04:13.370> here<00:04:13.639> you<00:04:13.849> can<00:04:14.030> see

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
pins and then right here you can see

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.580 
pins and then right here you can see
where<00:04:15.109> I<00:04:15.169> went<00:04:15.349> forward<00:04:17.139> when<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:18.289> part

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
through it let me find it it's hard to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.550 
through it let me find it it's hard to
find<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.989> scene

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560
