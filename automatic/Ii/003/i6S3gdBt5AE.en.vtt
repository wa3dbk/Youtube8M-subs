hey guys this is the professor and we're
going<00:00:14.720> to<00:00:14.810> take<00:00:14.960> boiled<00:00:15.410> water<00:00:15.620> to<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.100> next

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.370 
going to take boiled water to the next

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.740 
going to take boiled water to the next
level<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.200> boil<00:00:18.200> up<00:00:18.380> some<00:00:18.410> potatoes<00:00:18.710> here<00:00:19.750> and

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
level and boil up some potatoes here and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.920 
level and boil up some potatoes here and
so<00:00:20.990> what<00:00:21.200> we've<00:00:21.380> done<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:22.690> cut<00:00:23.690> up<00:00:23.840> about

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
so what we've done is to cut up about

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.830 
so what we've done is to cut up about
three<00:00:24.350> potatoes<00:00:24.860> into<00:00:25.070> small<00:00:25.490> pieces<00:00:26.000> once

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
again the smaller you cut them up the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.420 
again the smaller you cut them up the
pastor<00:00:28.820> they're<00:00:29.509> going<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.900> cook<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.099> so

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
we've got those peeled cut up into

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.980 
we've got those peeled cut up into
chunks<00:00:33.550> put<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.670> our<00:00:34.790> boil<00:00:35.090> can<00:00:35.390> here<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:35.810> just

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
chunks put in our boil can here and just

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.170 
chunks put in our boil can here and just
covered<00:00:36.350> with<00:00:36.530> some<00:00:36.770> water<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:37.700> just<00:00:38.000> like

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
boiling water for anything else I'll get

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.120 
boiling water for anything else I'll get
that<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.300> fire<00:00:41.540> you<00:00:42.440> set<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.800> beside<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
that in the fire you set it beside the

that in the fire you set it beside the
fire<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:43.760> let<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.240> heat<00:00:44.900> up<00:00:44.930> once<00:00:45.380> it<00:00:45.500> starts

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
fire and let it heat up once it starts

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.830 
fire and let it heat up once it starts
to<00:00:45.950> boil<00:00:46.160> well<00:00:47.000> back<00:00:47.210> it<00:00:47.390> up<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.600> little<00:00:47.720> bit

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
to boil well back it up a little bit

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.690 
to boil well back it up a little bit
just<00:00:48.200> keep<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.650> ball<00:00:48.860> going<00:00:49.160> for<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.460> few

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
just keep that ball going for a few

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.610 
just keep that ball going for a few
minutes<00:00:49.880> you'll<00:00:50.720> see<00:00:50.900> how<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.080> boiling<00:00:51.530> of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
minutes you'll see how the boiling of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:06.190 
minutes you'll see how the boiling of
potatoes<00:00:52.160> goes<00:00:53.090> today

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.130 

just<00:01:07.100> like<00:01:07.219> boiling<00:01:07.460> anything<00:01:07.909> else<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:08.869> want

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
just like boiling anything else you want

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.260 
just like boiling anything else you want
to<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.320> it<00:01:09.350> where<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.820> flames<00:01:10.820> are<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.210> to

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
to get it where the flames are going to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.639 
to get it where the flames are going to
be<00:01:11.360> pretty<00:01:11.600> hot<00:01:11.840> wind<00:01:12.409> keeps<00:01:12.649> changing<00:01:13.159> but

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
be pretty hot wind keeps changing but

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.779 
be pretty hot wind keeps changing but
it's<00:01:15.649> going<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.829> be<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> hot<00:01:16.189> spot<00:01:16.369> right<00:01:16.759> there

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
it's going to be a hot spot right there

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.940 
it's going to be a hot spot right there
we'll<00:01:17.179> watch<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.840> see<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.079> it<00:01:18.229> boils<00:01:18.439> here

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
we'll watch that to see if it boils here

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.190 
we'll watch that to see if it boils here
in<00:01:19.789> a<00:01:19.969> few<00:01:20.179> minutes<00:01:20.240> if<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.689> doesn't<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.049> can

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
in a few minutes if it doesn't we can

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:33.309 
in a few minutes if it doesn't we can
always<00:01:21.320> move<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> hotter<00:01:22.039> spot<00:01:32.319> okay

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
always move it to a hotter spot okay

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.020 
always move it to a hotter spot okay
well<00:01:33.679> it's<00:01:33.860> been<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:34.189> eight<00:01:34.429> minutes<00:01:34.610> since

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
well it's been just eight minutes since

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.240 
well it's been just eight minutes since
we<00:01:35.179> put<00:01:35.390> those<00:01:35.509> potatoes<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.799> can<00:01:37.009> see

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
we put those potatoes on and you can see

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.120 
we put those potatoes on and you can see
now<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.460> kettle's<00:01:38.259> really<00:01:39.259> foaming<00:01:39.709> up<00:01:39.860> I

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
now the kettle's really foaming up I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.740 
now the kettle's really foaming up I
didn't<00:01:40.490> think<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.729> was<00:01:40.819> doing<00:01:41.119> much<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.479> start

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
didn't think it was doing much to start

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.910 
didn't think it was doing much to start
with<00:01:41.929> so<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.259> stack<00:01:42.649> those<00:01:43.119> smaller<00:01:44.119> sticks

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
with so I stack those smaller sticks

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.969 
with so I stack those smaller sticks
right<00:01:45.920> around<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.599> can<00:01:47.599> so<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.229> wind

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
right around the can so that the wind

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.399 
right around the can so that the wind
would<00:01:49.189> blow<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.670> flame<00:01:50.020> right<00:01:51.020> around<00:01:51.259> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
would blow that flame right around the

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.919 
would blow that flame right around the
outside<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:51.950> cam<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:53.569> you<00:01:53.630> can

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
outside of that cam and now you can

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.499 
outside of that cam and now you can
notice<00:01:54.140> in<00:01:54.470> there<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.509> boiling

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
notice in there that it's really boiling

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.010 
notice in there that it's really boiling
those<00:01:56.869> potatoes<00:01:57.439> up<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.270> rate<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> boy<00:01:59.750> like

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
those potatoes up so to rate a boy like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.219 
those potatoes up so to rate a boy like
that<00:02:00.049> they'll<00:02:00.560> be<00:02:00.590> done<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.360> another<00:02:02.360> 10

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
that they'll be done in another 10

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.600 
that they'll be done in another 10
minutes<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.709> so<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.989> so<00:02:06.069> those<00:02:07.069> are<00:02:07.310> boiled
