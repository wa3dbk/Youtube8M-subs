 Hello My Name is Life Liter 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 I'm explaining to Ulrich Lepper for the free browser the Star Trek in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.050
 Tunis DAX 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 it is well known that the Klingons like their pets on the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.870
 Take spaceships 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.710
 that one of the best known pets the kid live 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.390
 is Â«That's tough 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 the Klingon word for it is logically Tarrach 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360
 you could imagine that way 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.940
 of course, the park is one of the more popular pets that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.410
 Klingons 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 you could be very much the same as people like to keep a dog 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 Harald is a bit later than a dog and very difficult too 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.040
 tame 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 In any case, you can also fail and use the following four commands 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.530
 that will follow 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.610
 by the way team command takes over Ingo Nischenthema Tim Kunz Klingon 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.280
 held 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.410
 that means that then the prefix 4 bn 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.790
 does not come to that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 so if one says to a man one is set however 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 you just say to an animal 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.440
 in a hot seat 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.440
 Stop that is 11 more 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 stay standing 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.980
 another pet that is not really kept by King Cole 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.820
 but Ferrari was very often believing 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 I locked that in no cage here that was a very 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.200
 dangerous animal is what you rarely should take out us 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 You have to know that this animal does not Federer also at midnight 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.770
 or after midnight but not at all what it is all about 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 warm and if I am 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.980
 because otherwise a misfortune happens 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.900
