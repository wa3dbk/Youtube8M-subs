00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.510
 well then I find today for 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 you make a hall 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 so that's going to concern everything that is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.790
 co candles and a little beauty that's it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.360
 but that's what I did this month 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.360
 during the month of December is so I 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.050
 will start with the beauty category 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.520
 so I bought that stuff I 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.930
 party to and I took two 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 latest in the new collection 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:51.870
 so I first took the 4 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 137 and so it's a pink polish and with 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.239
 all full of multicolored sequins 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 here and I took the 442 so it's a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 black polish with glitter 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 multicolored also so currently I 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.630
 door on my nails on these two there the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.600
 black polish and honestly it's too much 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.289
 too beautiful and it's with a bad finish are 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.499
 just but then I left to go 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.389
 and I took a garland of 120 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.749
 fireflies with eight sets of lights 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:34.350
 white bulbs where there is 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:37.109
 like this and I paid them 12 euros 99 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 so lachenaie currently attached to 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.759
 tie me taped on my name so I 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 will show you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.590
 so that's how the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.149
 calendar and I find it very very pretty 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.649
 as we can see it's not the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.439
 simple white but it's bulbs 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 yellow have good so that's okay 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.439
 looks pretty 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.990
 I like a lot and to come throw and to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.299
 thiais I bought these two little ones 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.310
 stuff there so it was together so he 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.710
 there is a tweezers 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 and a chisel to cut the hair of the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.429
 nose but hey I 'm not going to use it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 because I do not have the nose hair that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.520
 come out and so these two there my side of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.099
 0 49 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.220
 so it was together so that's it 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.280
 to cut then I wanted a tree 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.349
 bright like this but on 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.150
 internet cost at least 30 euros I 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.330
 thought it was expensive 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.030
 and I passed like that to auchan and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 I saw that they sold and not very 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.739
 very expensive it comes as these 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.680
 as you see so it is 45 cm 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.209
 and I paid them 10 onions more 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.580
 accomplished listen not very very expensive and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.680
 so I did not say and I jumped on it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 the frankly I love them he does 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.489
 really minds of our rooms 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.870
 I'm waiting so that's all for the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.780
 part of it as now we will go 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.250
 by the party candles so recently 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.530
 I discovered that there was a shop 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.170
 which sells yankee candle outlets to 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.510
 lyon it is next to the train station 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.190
 the part god I will put you all 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.100
 coordinates of this shop in bar 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.290
 do not hesitate to see them because 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.439
 that they are going a lot a lot 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.260
 he sells everything that is co 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.670
 candles by clicking dle after I have not 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.329
 really look at what they were selling 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.620
 I was rather omnibulated by the candles 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:36.129
 antique in mourning and and sell of everything 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.359
 votive tartlets big jars 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.890
 average djiar small garden burns 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:46.030
 frankly it's a crazy thing what 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.689
 and so here is how the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.540
 this little bag 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:56.439
 and I took only 6 tarts 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 and the tarts cost 1 euro 80 and its 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:04.840
 valley rather the shot and besides I'm 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:09.430
 am also taken a small box of 2 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.760
 billion here it was on sale 35 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.159
 euros the two instead of more than 40 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.370
 euros 2 so here I bought it 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:21.150
 for marans and for the mom of my 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.840
 darling to buy bag for her 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.120
 so here I have no candles because 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.880
 that and wrapped with gift wrap 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.240
 but it was the clean cotton I think and 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.699
 the joke that coconut I believe I 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:43.320
 call me to fire so that's me 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.320
 I took 6 tarts 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.940
 he presents himself in a paper like 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:57.370
 worry and I still took the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.370
 vanilla with vanilla and lime line 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:10.990
 Are we among other I love I 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:14.870
 took the stage sound of peace the next 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:20.450
 the smell is really a smell that is 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:24.280
 very very light and I love that I have 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.280
 taken last airbender crime 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.830
 I thought it was a smell 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.910
 heady but ultimately not 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:39.110
 really very very good sense not at all 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:44.330
 the butter between quimerc'h then I 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:49.040
 took the fold of the gombe fresh fruits of 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:52.720
 dragon's own fresh dragon fruit 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.100
 pink here but frankly she loves 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.240
 that's among others will have me 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.090
 I love everything that is fruity dub 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.669
 cool but I do not like all that 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.540
 is greedy smell report this one 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:14.180
 but they are among others birds 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:17.080
 so if I took the waikiki malone and 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.930
 it really feels different 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:27.189
 I sleep and finally I took the 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:29.409
 merit match malo here's the airlock between 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.770
 others will have so that's all for 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.569
 my shopping yankee kandel 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.979
 I'm really happy with this shop 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:41.250
 for sure I 'm here 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.479
 that's all for me 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.539
 so that's all for my shopping 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.310
 yankee camp now as I know 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.139
 there store in lyon that sell 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.069
 nautic years of age would no longer pass through 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.050
 Internet 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.969
 because on the internet you pay the 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.879
 shipping and in addition you can not 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.860
 not smell the odors directly then 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:02.289
 that in store you take your time at 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.550
 take out the smells and here you know 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.349
 no shipping costs so it's just 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.759
 awesome 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:08.710
 so that's all for my role 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.259
 as we can see I do not have 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.990
 a lot to buy because like 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:16.360
 Christmas is coming soon I have to buy 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.520
 first one and christmas gifts and everything 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.069
 and everything and then so bad 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.500
 a little money I can have fun 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:26.590
 so here I bought just the essential 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.990
 and I'm really happy with 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.729
 everything I bought and so 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.210
 now I think that's it 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.020
