00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.600
 The holy video is about founding 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.199
 earlier and in the parish church is that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the autumn we go deep into the garden 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.470
 to make the floor freeze out 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 can 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.160
 and these are soil fertility 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.950
 Wanted to stay in modern again 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.250
 actually always go separate ground 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 if possible in peace without a back burner stings 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 always around and you sit in late autumn 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.310
 that horst end of september mid october 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 were the fruits and is a foundation 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.530
 those with whom today wear yes in the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.300
 before native cilia and that is now 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 about three weeks has it now 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 already on a bar because they complete the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.970
 the benefits of founding is the benefits 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example, did not talk about nitrogen 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.679
 tie 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.399
 that means air nitrogen in the plants 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:18.210
 herself she is still growing up 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.810
 fred freezes them over in winter completely 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.340
 it is not hardy 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 The nitrogen remains so imboden 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 and it does not matter now and over 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.819
 protects the floor easily and relaxed and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.539
 promotes all the microorganisms and 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.859
 take citizens live 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.770
 in the spring folder then simply with 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.600
 the computer or in the google all 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.450
 easy to meter just very 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.579
 bill and work with currently scarce 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.909
 a very crumbly Erdmanns 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.380
 storyteller how beautiful the earth is and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.479
 you can talk it all over and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 spurs and that is very easy and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.789
 fast 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 you can only be there or raps 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.420
 or on the internet are loose diverse 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.420
 can provide nitrogen
