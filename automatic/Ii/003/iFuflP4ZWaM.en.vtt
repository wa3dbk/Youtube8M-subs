shot so that's what I'm gonna try to do

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.630

six foot ten to forty five and just bear

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
six foot ten to forty five and just bear
in<00:00:38.790> mind<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.170> shooting<00:00:40.590> guard<00:00:40.770> six

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
in mind that I have a shooting guard six

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
in mind that I have a shooting guard six
foot<00:00:41.879> six<00:00:42.120> he's<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> Rockets<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.350> now

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
foot six he's on the Rockets right now

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.700 
foot six he's on the Rockets right now
and<00:00:43.980> he's<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.090> sitting<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> background

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and he's also sitting in the background

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
and he's also sitting in the background
so<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.940> him<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.390> there's<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:48.870> much

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so I have him if there's not very much

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.389 
so I have him if there's not very much
support<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.680> power<00:00:49.890> floor<00:00:50.160> because

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
support for this power floor because

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
support for this power floor because
I'll<00:00:50.520> admit<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:52.289> skeptical<00:00:52.980> about

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.750 
and I'm not really that great at playing
the<00:00:57.180> big<00:00:57.390> positions<00:00:57.870> anyway<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.520> I've<00:00:59.609> got

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the big positions anyway but so I've got

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
the big positions anyway but so I've got
that<00:00:59.850> three-point<00:01:00.270> shooting<00:01:00.600> shooting<00:01:00.960> guard

that three-point shooting shooting guard

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.399 
that three-point shooting shooting guard
also<00:01:02.000> if<00:01:03.000> there's<00:01:03.420> enough<00:01:03.719> support<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
also if there's enough support for it I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.230 
also if there's enough support for it I
will<00:01:04.470> switch<00:01:04.769> over<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> guy<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.700> stop

shots inside close and medium are

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.660 
shots inside close and medium are
relatively<00:02:01.710> higher<00:02:01.950> than<00:02:02.219> most<00:02:02.369> power

though I'm a shooting power forward if I
get<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:09.989> rebounds<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> inside<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> want

hands another thing I want to work on
because<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.519> helps<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.910> rebounding<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
because that helps with rebounding and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.150 
because that helps with rebounding and
it<00:02:15.810> helps<00:02:16.019> with<00:02:16.140> getting<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.769> ball<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.069> your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it helps with getting the ball in your

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
it helps with getting the ball in your
spring<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.550> catch<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> rebounds

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
spring will it catch it so the rebounds

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.559 
spring will it catch it so the rebounds
aren't<00:02:19.410> great<00:02:19.590> early<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.519> another<00:02:21.330> thing

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
aren't great early on and another thing

aren't great early on and another thing
I'm<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> work<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.379> know

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
I'm gonna have to work I you know

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.770 
I'm gonna have to work I you know
vertical<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.090> rebounds<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:24.660> not

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
vertical and then the rebounds I'm not

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.420 
vertical and then the rebounds I'm not
sure<00:02:25.050> how<00:02:25.319> much<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.980> year<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
sure how much they do this year but it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
sure how much they do this year but it
seems<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:26.879> they<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.019> bit<00:02:28.140> more

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
seems like they do a little bit more

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.410 
seems like they do a little bit more
than<00:02:28.410> last<00:02:28.530> year

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
than last year

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.350 
than last year
speed<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.599> absolutely<00:02:31.290> atrocious<00:02:31.650> at<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.360> 30

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
speed is absolutely atrocious at a 30

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.809 
speed is absolutely atrocious at a 30
overall<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.739> that's<00:02:35.129> gonna<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.519> change

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
overall and that's gonna have to change

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.030 
overall and that's gonna have to change
but<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.510> using<00:02:37.319> Kevin<00:02:37.709> Durant's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
but you can see using Kevin Durant's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.979 
but you can see using Kevin Durant's
jumper<00:02:38.370> gotta<00:02:38.549> be<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> silky-smooth<00:02:39.450> jump<00:02:39.750> shot

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
jumper gotta be a silky-smooth jump shot

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.710 
jumper gotta be a silky-smooth jump shot
and<00:02:40.489> Kevin<00:02:41.489> Durant's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> pretty<00:02:41.970> big<00:02:42.180> guy<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and Kevin Durant's a pretty big guy and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.600 
and Kevin Durant's a pretty big guy and
about<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.170> same<00:02:43.349> size<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.040> think<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.430> looks

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
about the same size so I think it looks

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.559 
about the same size so I think it looks
pretty<00:02:45.540> legit<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.319> then<00:02:46.790> using<00:02:47.790> LeBrons<00:02:48.209> fade

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
pretty legit and then using LeBrons fade

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.229 
pretty legit and then using LeBrons fade
away<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.170> gotta<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.940> bit<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
away and gotta have a little bit of

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.030 
away and gotta have a little bit of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
like a point guard that would just look

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.900 
like a point guard that would just look
