out<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.139> I'll<00:00:14.710> try<00:00:14.950> I've<00:00:15.130> checked<00:00:15.370> with<00:00:15.490> the

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
out and I'll try I've checked with the

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.000 
out and I'll try I've checked with the
screws<00:00:16.000> everything<00:00:16.330> and<00:00:17.170> it's<00:00:17.710> not<00:00:17.830> doing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
screws everything and it's not doing

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.620 
screws everything and it's not doing
anything<00:00:18.250> yourself<00:00:18.430> so<00:00:19.150> I<00:00:19.210> thought<00:00:19.480> about

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
anything yourself so I thought about

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.380 
anything yourself so I thought about
taking<00:00:19.930> off<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.320> cob<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:21.160> cleaning<00:00:22.119> it<00:00:22.270> all

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
taking off the cob and cleaning it all

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.950 
taking off the cob and cleaning it all
out<00:00:22.600> so<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.529> first<00:00:23.830> thing<00:00:24.010> I'd<00:00:24.160> done<00:00:24.369> was<00:00:24.960> took

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
out so the first thing I'd done was took

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.480 
out so the first thing I'd done was took
off<00:00:26.109> this<00:00:26.289> because<00:00:26.830> it<00:00:26.920> was<00:00:27.010> in<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.220> way<00:00:27.340> of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
off this because it was in the way of

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.120 
off this because it was in the way of
the<00:00:27.609> fruit<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.689> air<00:00:28.840> filter<00:00:29.130> once

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130

I<00:00:30.220> took<00:00:30.279> up<00:00:30.490> that<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:30.789> for<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.000> air<00:00:31.150> filter

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
I took up that so for the air filter

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.020 
I took up that so for the air filter
once<00:00:32.739> I<00:00:32.860> took<00:00:33.040> with<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.280> air<00:00:33.489> food<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:33.969> I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
once I took with the air food so I

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.209 
once I took with the air food so I

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 
silicon don't if you can see it but

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.490 
silicon don't if you can see it but
there<00:07:53.430> are<00:07:53.460> some<00:07:53.910> still<00:07:54.750> some<00:07:54.960> bits<00:07:55.170> in<00:07:55.350> there

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 
there are some still some bits in there

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.480 
there are some still some bits in there
so<00:07:56.430> I'm<00:07:57.120> to<00:07:57.330> go<00:07:57.450> back<00:07:57.920> open<00:07:58.920> my<00:07:59.040> picture<00:07:59.400> and

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.490 
so I'm to go back open my picture and

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.490 
so I'm to go back open my picture and
they<00:07:59.610> come<00:07:59.910> through<00:08:00.120> on<00:08:00.210> its<00:08:00.360> own<00:08:00.540> not<00:08:01.290> into

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 
they come through on its own not into

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.320 
they come through on its own not into
the<00:08:01.590> float<00:08:01.830> but<00:08:02.010> just<00:08:02.400> they<00:08:02.550> go<00:08:02.790> into<00:08:03.060> a<00:08:03.090> pot

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.330 
the float but just they go into a pot

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.900 
the float but just they go into a pot
somewhere<00:08:03.540> just<00:08:04.530> create<00:08:05.190> clean<00:08:05.520> it<00:08:05.670> a<00:08:05.730> little

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910 
somewhere just create clean it a little

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.060 
somewhere just create clean it a little
bit<00:08:06.140> and<00:08:07.140> then<00:08:07.290> that's<00:08:07.470> it<00:08:07.620> Rudy

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.070 
bit and then that's it Rudy

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.800 
bit and then that's it Rudy
so<00:08:08.490> thanks<00:08:08.910> for<00:08:08.940> watching<00:08:09.060> please<00:08:09.540> like
