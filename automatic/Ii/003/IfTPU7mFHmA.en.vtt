00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
away clearly visible can get gold for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.049 
away clearly visible can get gold for
that<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:37.170> side

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
hours to do this because then there is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.439 
hours to do this because then there is
