00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
the design of the weapon and I really
like<00:01:32.009> how<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> looked<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.970> pretty<00:01:33.329> much

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
like how it looked and that pretty much

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600 
like how it looked and that pretty much
made<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> try<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> weapon<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
made me want to try out this weapon I

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.120 
made me want to try out this weapon I
immediately<00:01:36.360> farmed<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> grabbed<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
immediately farmed for it and grabbed it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.249 
immediately farmed for it and grabbed it
and<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.729> soon<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.060> got<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.630> upgraded<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and as soon as I got it I upgraded the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.440 
and as soon as I got it I upgraded the
+10<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> seeing<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.270> had

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
+10 and all that and seeing that it had

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
+10 and all that and seeing that it had
an<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> scaling<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.380> dexterity<00:01:44.240> made<00:01:45.240> me<00:01:45.390> even

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
an a scaling in dexterity made me even

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
an a scaling in dexterity made me even
more<00:01:45.689> excited<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> use<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.950> mainly

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
more excited to want to use it mainly

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.480 
more excited to want to use it mainly
because<00:01:47.700> my<00:01:48.119> character<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> dex<00:01:49.229> build<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
because my character is a dex build so I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.639 
because my character is a dex build so I
was<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:50.880> expecting<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.200> lot<00:01:52.500> of

weapons and I try to kind of kind of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.789 
weapons and I try to kind of kind of
keep<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> neutral<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:04.140> people<00:02:04.380> who

keep it neutral so that way people who

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.459 
keep it neutral so that way people who
watch<00:02:05.790> these<00:02:06.030> videos<00:02:06.420> aren't<00:02:06.780> swayed<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.409> way

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469

pros and the cons

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.069 
pros and the cons
kind<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.759> let<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.030> decide<00:02:11.329> whether<00:02:11.569> or<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:11.870> it

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
kind of let you decide whether or not it

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.569 
kind of let you decide whether or not it
may<00:02:12.230> or<00:02:12.379> may<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.829> worth<00:02:13.010> using

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
may or may not be worth using

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.000 
may or may not be worth using
but<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:14.420> weapon<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:15.140> have<00:02:15.439> to<00:02:15.560> be<00:02:15.650> honest

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
but with this weapon I have to be honest

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.289 
but with this weapon I have to be honest
and<00:02:16.189> I<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.579> say<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.939> there<00:02:17.150> are<00:02:17.239> a

and I have to say that there are a

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.030 
and I have to say that there are a
little<00:02:17.510> bit<00:02:17.629> more<00:02:17.750> constant<00:02:18.439> there<00:02:18.560> are<00:02:18.680> pros

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
little bit more constant there are pros

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.000 
little bit more constant there are pros
the<00:02:19.969> cons<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:21.019> main<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.409> at<00:02:21.560> least<00:02:21.709> being

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
the cons the main one at least being

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.330 
the cons the main one at least being
that<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.459> does<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.560> Reaper<00:02:24.560> moveset<00:02:25.040> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
that it does have the Reaper moveset and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.000 
that it does have the Reaper moveset and
the<00:02:26.030> Reaper<00:02:26.329> moveset<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.900> actually<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> bad

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the Reaper moveset is actually not a bad

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.940 
the Reaper moveset is actually not a bad
move<00:02:28.189> sent<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:28.760> very<00:02:29.450> stationary<00:02:30.049> but<00:02:30.829> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
move sent it's very stationary but the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.399 
move sent it's very stationary but the
thing<00:02:31.159> is<00:02:31.189> what<00:02:31.549> this<00:02:31.700> weapon<00:02:31.879> is<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.420> it

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
thing is what this weapon is that it

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.229 
thing is what this weapon is that it
really<00:02:33.799> doesn't<00:02:34.189> have<00:02:34.430> too<00:02:34.579> much<00:02:34.700> length<00:02:35.030> to

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
really doesn't have too much length to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.629 
really doesn't have too much length to
it<00:02:35.389> now<00:02:36.079> a<00:02:36.500> lot<00:02:36.799> of<00:02:36.829> people<00:02:37.099> have<00:02:37.189> been<00:02:37.400> saying

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
it now a lot of people have been saying

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.539 
it now a lot of people have been saying
that<00:02:37.939> the<00:02:38.209> Reapers<00:02:38.719> the<00:02:39.319> Reaper<00:02:40.010> weapon<00:02:40.310> types

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
that the Reapers the Reaper weapon types

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.229 
that the Reapers the Reaper weapon types
in<00:02:40.849> this<00:02:41.060> game<00:02:41.269> are<00:02:41.540> pretty<00:02:41.930> bad<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.239> while

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
in this game are pretty bad and while

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.909 
in this game are pretty bad and while
that's<00:02:44.389> not<00:02:44.659> true<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.290> some<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.799> are

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
that's not true and some of them are

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.289 
that's not true and some of them are
actually<00:02:46.040> pretty<00:02:46.370> good<00:02:46.579> like<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.939> size<00:02:47.150> of

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
actually pretty good like the size of

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.319 
actually pretty good like the size of
one<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.500> full<00:02:48.709> moon<00:02:48.889> sickle<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.549> all<00:02:49.819> honesty

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
one the full moon sickle in all honesty

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.379 
one the full moon sickle in all honesty
is<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:52.010> little<00:02:52.189> too<00:02:52.400> short<00:02:52.669> if<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
is it's just a little too short if it

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:54.819 
is it's just a little too short if it
had<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> little<00:02:53.840> bit<00:02:53.930> more<00:02:54.109> range<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.709> then

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
had a little bit more range to it then

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.800 
had a little bit more range to it then
it<00:02:54.950> would<00:02:55.099> be<00:02:55.219> a<00:02:55.250> good<00:02:55.459> weapon<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.329> when<00:02:56.689> you

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
it would be a good weapon but when you

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.839 
it would be a good weapon but when you
pair<00:02:57.049> up<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.469> fact<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:58.040> not<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.579> long

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
pair up the fact that it's not that long

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.059 
pair up the fact that it's not that long
and<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.450> moveset<00:03:00.049> itself<00:03:00.439> is<00:03:00.560> actually<00:03:00.680> very

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
and the moveset itself is actually very

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.940 
and the moveset itself is actually very
stationary<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:02.780> people<00:03:03.319> really<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.799> do

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
stationary all people really have to do

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.309 
stationary all people really have to do
is<00:03:04.219> stand<00:03:04.489> outside<00:03:04.969> of<00:03:05.150> your<00:03:05.239> range<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:06.109> fact

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
is stand outside of your range the fact

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.140 
is stand outside of your range the fact
that<00:03:06.409> this<00:03:06.680> weapon<00:03:07.040> attacks<00:03:07.609> kind<00:03:07.849> of<00:03:07.939> slow

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that this weapon attacks kind of slow

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940 
that this weapon attacks kind of slow
and<00:03:08.359> it<00:03:08.480> also<00:03:08.629> has<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> slow<00:03:09.200> recover<00:03:09.560> time<00:03:09.769> is

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
and it also has a slow recover time is

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.740 
and it also has a slow recover time is
another<00:03:10.189> con<00:03:10.519> for<00:03:10.790> me<00:03:10.819> I<00:03:11.090> was<00:03:11.480> really

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
another con for me I was really

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.710 
another con for me I was really
surprised<00:03:12.139> and<00:03:12.639> how<00:03:13.639> punished<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.269> was<00:03:14.419> getting

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
surprised and how punished I was getting

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.140 
surprised and how punished I was getting
from<00:03:15.290> doing<00:03:15.680> some<00:03:15.919> you<00:03:16.159> know<00:03:16.280> doing<00:03:16.549> maybe<00:03:16.729> 2r

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
from doing some you know doing maybe 2r

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.699 
from doing some you know doing maybe 2r
once<00:03:17.389> and<00:03:17.659> then<00:03:17.810> them<00:03:17.989> coming<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.440> really

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
once and then them coming in really

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.680 
once and then them coming in really
quick<00:03:18.949> and<00:03:19.220> pretty<00:03:19.729> much<00:03:19.879> doing<00:03:20.299> some<00:03:20.449> real

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
quick and pretty much doing some real

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.360 
quick and pretty much doing some real
good<00:03:20.870> damage<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.319> me<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.620> was<00:03:22.010> also<00:03:22.220> really

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
good damage to me I was also really

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.369 
good damage to me I was also really
surprised<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> fact<00:03:23.449> that<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.049> damage

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
surprised that the fact that the damage

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.740 
surprised that the fact that the damage
that<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.560> was<00:03:24.739> doing<00:03:25.040> initially<00:03:26.030> was<00:03:26.479> actually

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
that I was doing initially was actually

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.899 
that I was doing initially was actually
kind<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.019> low<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.409> what<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:27.739> had<00:03:27.979> did<00:03:28.189> was<00:03:28.430> as

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
kind of low and what I had did was as

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.490 
kind of low and what I had did was as
soon<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.269> grabbed<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.870> saw<00:03:30.169> that<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.470> had

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
soon as I grabbed it I saw that it had

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.640 
soon as I grabbed it I saw that it had
did<00:03:30.829> some<00:03:31.430> built-in<00:03:31.790> bleed<00:03:32.060> damage<00:03:32.419> so<00:03:32.900> what<00:03:33.620> I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
did some built-in bleed damage so what I

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.530 
did some built-in bleed damage so what I
ended<00:03:33.919> up<00:03:34.010> doing<00:03:34.189> was<00:03:34.519> going<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:35.060> Macduff<00:03:35.419> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
ended up doing was going to Macduff and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.869 
ended up doing was going to Macduff and
infusing<00:03:36.079> this<00:03:36.169> weapon<00:03:36.439> with<00:03:36.560> bleed<00:03:36.879> pretty

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
infusing this weapon with bleed pretty

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.449 
infusing this weapon with bleed pretty
much<00:03:38.030> hoping<00:03:38.419> that<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.810> would<00:03:39.109> do<00:03:39.409> some<00:03:39.919> actual

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
much hoping that it would do some actual

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
much hoping that it would do some actual
bleed<00:03:40.790> status<00:03:41.239> damage<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.810> these<00:03:42.049> people<00:03:42.379> that

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
bleed status damage to these people that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.679 
bleed status damage to these people that
was<00:03:43.220> actually<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.549> really<00:03:43.849> bad<00:03:44.060> idea

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
was actually a really bad idea

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.780 
was actually a really bad idea
the<00:03:45.049> reason<00:03:45.379> you're<00:03:45.500> not<00:03:45.530> seeing<00:03:45.919> any<00:03:46.189> PvP

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the reason you're not seeing any PvP

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.149 
the reason you're not seeing any PvP

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
get a single win and I had some pretty

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:59.830 
get a single win and I had some pretty
decent<00:03:58.189> matches<00:03:58.699> I<00:03:58.819> had<00:03:58.970> some<00:03:59.209> real<00:03:59.599> close

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
decent matches I had some real close

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.479 
decent matches I had some real close
ones<00:04:00.109> but<00:04:00.290> at<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.500> same<00:04:00.650> time<00:04:00.859> I<00:04:00.919> didn't<00:04:01.340> get<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
single win and on and off I pretty much

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.119 
single win and on and off I pretty much
went<00:04:05.209> back<00:04:05.419> to<00:04:05.569> Macduff<00:04:05.870> an<00:04:06.079> infused<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.979> and

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
went back to Macduff an infused it and

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.499 
went back to Macduff an infused it and
then<00:04:07.310> when<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.519> unenthused<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.359> actually

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
then when I unenthused it I actually

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.390 
then when I unenthused it I actually
came<00:04:08.959> back<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.229> was<00:04:09.560> seeing<00:04:09.799> some<00:04:09.979> actual

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
came back and was seeing some actual

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.179 
came back and was seeing some actual
progress<00:04:10.989> another<00:04:11.989> sort<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.409> con<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.650> guess<00:04:13.009> is

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
progress another sort of con I guess is

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.099 
progress another sort of con I guess is
the<00:04:13.310> fact<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.790> does<00:04:14.000> have<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.870> little<00:04:15.199> bit

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
the fact that it does have a little bit

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.039 
the fact that it does have a little bit
lack<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.829> tracking<00:04:17.599> most<00:04:18.599> of<00:04:18.750> these<00:04:18.810> weapons

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
lack in tracking most of these weapons

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.170 
lack in tracking most of these weapons
when<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.949> certain<00:04:20.280> moves<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.789> can<00:04:21.000> kind

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
when you do certain moves you can kind

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.990 
when you do certain moves you can kind
of<00:04:21.299> aim<00:04:22.049> with<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.889> left<00:04:23.129> analog<00:04:23.310> stick<00:04:23.580> on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
of aim with the left analog stick on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.459 
of aim with the left analog stick on
exactly<00:04:24.509> where<00:04:24.629> you<00:04:24.719> want<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.960> go<00:04:25.080> even<00:04:25.319> though

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
exactly where you want to go even though

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.070 
exactly where you want to go even though
it<00:04:26.069> hasn't<00:04:26.669> done<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.270> full<00:04:27.419> move<00:04:27.659> yet<00:04:27.900> and

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
it hasn't done the full move yet and

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.439 
it hasn't done the full move yet and
with<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.770> weapon<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.340> was<00:04:29.849> kind<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.090> surprised

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
with this weapon I was kind of surprised

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.869 
with this weapon I was kind of surprised
that<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.810> running<00:04:31.080> attack<00:04:31.349> I<00:04:32.039> was<00:04:32.490> trying<00:04:32.819> to

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
that the running attack I was trying to

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.929 
that the running attack I was trying to
do<00:04:33.060> maybe<00:04:33.300> some<00:04:33.770> some<00:04:34.770> control<00:04:35.219> and<00:04:35.550> kind<00:04:35.849> of

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
do maybe some some control and kind of

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.149 
do maybe some some control and kind of
trying<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.599> predict<00:04:37.560> where<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.860> person

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.860 
trying to like predict where the person
would<00:04:38.250> ended<00:04:38.580> up<00:04:38.669> going<00:04:38.819> and<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.599> was<00:04:39.719> really

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
would ended up going and I was really

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.420 
would ended up going and I was really
surprised<00:04:40.259> at<00:04:40.409> how<00:04:40.469> often<00:04:40.949> I<00:04:41.039> was<00:04:41.159> doing<00:04:41.370> a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
surprised at how often I was doing a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.399 
surprised at how often I was doing a
running<00:04:41.699> attack<00:04:41.819> and<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.210> had<00:04:42.389> very<00:04:42.629> minimum

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
running attack and I had very minimum

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.010 
running attack and I had very minimum
control<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:44.009> I<00:04:44.430> ended<00:04:44.669> up<00:04:44.789> wanting<00:04:45.479> to<00:04:45.599> go<00:04:45.750> left

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
control if I ended up wanting to go left

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.839 
control if I ended up wanting to go left
or<00:04:46.139> right<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.379> only<00:04:46.620> went<00:04:46.919> just<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.460> little<00:04:47.699> bit

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
or right I only went just a little bit

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.930 
or right I only went just a little bit
and<00:04:48.030> then<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.270> didn't<00:04:48.539> go<00:04:48.659> anymore<00:04:48.930> after<00:04:49.500> that

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
and then I didn't go anymore after that

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.369 
and then I didn't go anymore after that
so<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:51.090> was<00:04:51.180> kind<00:04:51.389> of<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.569> con<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:51.900> my<00:04:52.020> opinion

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
so that was kind of a con in my opinion

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.010 
so that was kind of a con in my opinion
and<00:04:52.969> pretty<00:04:53.969> much<00:04:54.120> all<00:04:54.300> in<00:04:54.539> all<00:04:54.690> if<00:04:54.870> you're

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
time going into the pros of this weapon

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.670 
time going into the pros of this weapon
the<00:05:05.190> major<00:05:06.180> pro<00:05:06.539> that<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.780> can<00:05:06.960> think<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.349> is<00:05:07.500> the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
the major pro that I can think of is the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.290 
the major pro that I can think of is the
simple<00:05:08.069> fact<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.849> weapon<00:05:09.180> is

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
simple fact that this weapon is

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.990 
simple fact that this weapon is
definitely<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> learning<00:05:10.620> type<00:05:10.830> weapon<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.430> was

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
definitely a learning type weapon I was

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.209 
definitely a learning type weapon I was
noticing<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:13.319> more<00:05:13.529> and<00:05:13.650> more<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.830> played

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
noticing that the more and more I played

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.629 
noticing that the more and more I played
on<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:15.060> more<00:05:16.039> comfortable<00:05:17.039> I<00:05:17.189> was<00:05:17.370> getting

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
on the more comfortable I was getting

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.610 
on the more comfortable I was getting
with<00:05:17.759> just<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.090> overall<00:05:18.120> move<00:05:18.689> set<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
with just the overall move set the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.950 
with just the overall move set the
spacing<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.430> pretty<00:05:21.150> much<00:05:21.270> everything<00:05:21.629> about

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
spacing and pretty much everything about

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.540 
spacing and pretty much everything about
this<00:05:22.139> weapon<00:05:22.319> and<00:05:22.710> that<00:05:22.889> was<00:05:23.009> also<00:05:23.219> when<00:05:23.520> I

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
this weapon and that was also when I

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.820 
this weapon and that was also when I
started<00:05:23.849> seeing<00:05:24.090> some<00:05:24.300> actual<00:05:24.659> progress<00:05:24.900> most

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
started seeing some actual progress most

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.140 
started seeing some actual progress most
of<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.039> footage<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.520> actually<00:05:26.699> ended<00:05:27.060> up

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
of the footage that I actually ended up

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.459 
of the footage that I actually ended up
getting<00:05:27.479> was<00:05:27.659> towards<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.080> end<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.349> the

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
getting was towards the end of the

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:29.990 
getting was towards the end of the
session<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.919> I<00:05:28.949> had<00:05:29.190> with<00:05:29.370> this<00:05:29.520> weapon<00:05:29.699> and

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
session that I had with this weapon and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.149 
session that I had with this weapon and
that<00:05:30.779> was<00:05:30.900> mainly<00:05:31.110> because<00:05:31.319> I<00:05:31.500> had<00:05:31.740> built<00:05:31.979> up

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
that was mainly because I had built up

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.800 
that was mainly because I had built up
enough<00:05:32.460> confidence<00:05:32.940> into<00:05:33.270> knowing<00:05:33.659> how<00:05:33.779> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
enough confidence into knowing how to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.540 
enough confidence into knowing how to
use<00:05:33.960> this<00:05:34.229> weapon<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.949> that's<00:05:35.279> kind<00:05:35.490> of

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
use this weapon so that's kind of

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.920 
use this weapon so that's kind of
something<00:05:35.879> that<00:05:35.940> if<00:05:36.210> you're<00:05:36.330> looking<00:05:36.659> for<00:05:36.870> a

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
something that if you're looking for a

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.869 
something that if you're looking for a
different<00:05:37.259> type<00:05:37.589> of<00:05:37.620> weapon<00:05:38.069> especially

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
different type of weapon especially

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.309 
different type of weapon especially
since<00:05:39.089> they<00:05:39.240> say<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.599> Reapers<00:05:39.960> aren't<00:05:40.259> the

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
since they say the Reapers aren't the

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.439 
since they say the Reapers aren't the
greatest<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.759> pretty<00:05:41.940> much<00:05:42.029> want<00:05:42.360> to

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
greatest and you pretty much want to

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.749 
greatest and you pretty much want to
build<00:05:42.629> a<00:05:42.839> little<00:05:43.020> bit<00:05:43.139> more<00:05:43.409> skill<00:05:43.740> in<00:05:44.099> just<00:05:44.639> a

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
build a little bit more skill in just a

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:45.950 
build a little bit more skill in just a
different<00:05:45.120> type<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.389> weapon<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.839> is

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
different type of weapon this is

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.329 
different type of weapon this is
definitely<00:05:46.199> something<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.589> that<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.099> should

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
definitely something you that you should

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.180 
definitely something you that you should
try<00:05:47.610> out<00:05:47.819> like<00:05:48.539> I<00:05:48.569> said<00:05:48.870> at<00:05:49.229> first<00:05:49.529> it's<00:05:50.009> gonna

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
try out like I said at first it's gonna

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.610 
try out like I said at first it's gonna
be<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:50.339> little<00:05:50.550> rough<00:05:50.669> but<00:05:51.569> when<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.199> start

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
be a little rough but when you start

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.920 
be a little rough but when you start
upgrading<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:54.029> and<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:54.330> infuse<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.810> with

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
upgrading it and you infuse it with

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.240 
upgrading it and you infuse it with
something<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.349> maybe<00:05:55.500> even<00:05:55.680> buff<00:05:55.949> it<00:05:56.069> with<00:05:56.219> a

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
something and maybe even buff it with a

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.490 
something and maybe even buff it with a
little<00:05:56.520> bit<00:05:56.639> of<00:05:56.669> magic<00:05:57.419> or<00:05:57.539> whatever<00:05:57.659> you're

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
little bit of magic or whatever you're

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.170 
little bit of magic or whatever you're
gonna<00:05:58.710> start<00:05:58.979> seeing<00:05:59.159> some<00:05:59.400> actual<00:05:59.819> damage

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
gonna start seeing some actual damage

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.550 
gonna start seeing some actual damage
and<00:06:00.360> then<00:06:00.569> once<00:06:00.839> you<00:06:00.960> start<00:06:01.229> learning<00:06:01.349> the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
and then once you start learning the

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.110 
and then once you start learning the
move<00:06:01.800> set<00:06:02.039> and<00:06:02.219> the<00:06:02.279> spacing<00:06:02.669> that<00:06:02.759> you<00:06:02.819> need

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
move set and the spacing that you need

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.820 
move set and the spacing that you need
in<00:06:03.360> order<00:06:03.719> to<00:06:03.900> actually<00:06:04.080> start<00:06:04.469> doing<00:06:04.560> some

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
in order to actually start doing some

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.709 
in order to actually start doing some
decent<00:06:05.159> work<00:06:05.310> with<00:06:05.460> this<00:06:05.580> weapon<00:06:05.759> you're

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
decent work with this weapon you're

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:07.999 
decent work with this weapon you're
pretty<00:06:06.870> much<00:06:06.990> gonna<00:06:07.169> have<00:06:07.349> a<00:06:07.379> good<00:06:07.560> time<00:06:07.770> and

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
pretty much gonna have a good time and

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.409 
pretty much gonna have a good time and
that's<00:06:08.129> kind<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.460> what<00:06:08.580> I<00:06:08.610> had<00:06:08.789> got<00:06:08.969> out<00:06:09.000> of<00:06:09.270> it

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
that's kind of what I had got out of it

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.450 
that's kind of what I had got out of it
even<00:06:09.870> though<00:06:10.169> there<00:06:10.349> are<00:06:10.560> a<00:06:10.589> lot<00:06:11.009> of<00:06:11.039> negative

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460
