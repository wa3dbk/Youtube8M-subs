00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 to be interesting 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.429
 I want to show you how to do that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.030
 touchpad who you are at the console like that 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.320
 good as never used once useful on 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.210
 computer can use 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.980
 it controls a very normal as 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.320
 touchpad as you first get from a laptop 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030
 Above all , it knows everything works 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.949
 easy via usb connection 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 Alternatively, a bluetooth 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.539
 adapters are now used for the first 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.460
 step of the tutorial first 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.109
 you need the right program with 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.030
 you needed 3 for the 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.399
 control installed and the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.289
 applications with the man settings 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.329
 from the device can serve 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.729
 the program can be downloaded for free 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.580
 be the link you will find in the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.680
 Video description is simply the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.140
 link and download the file 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.090
 and continue with the second step 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 installing the driver opens the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.750
 downloaded file and closes 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.750
 installation process 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.190
 Now a new window opens in 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.830
 your rare development program that 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.330
 whole 7 zip or winrar are 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.310
 but we are not interested now 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.250
 important is only that the files for 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.350
 lie to you opens the first folder and 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.170
 the next ones with the name again 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.430
 virtual bass hits here you will find the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 file scp three waxes opens this with 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.530
 double click and the driver will be in 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 position 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.670
 now to the last step 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.740
 Now you just have to control the controller 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.640
 via usb or bluetooth with the pc 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.350
 connect 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.660
 once the computer is the controller 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.790
 you have recognized in the first behind 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
 folder of the downloaded file the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.680
 Open exe file scp server 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.600
 this is the operation program for 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 the controller now have yours 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.380
 controller already be recognized and 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 The mouse should be different from the controller 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 let a left click be done 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.410
 with the l1 key and a right click with 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 he was the key, that's it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.010
