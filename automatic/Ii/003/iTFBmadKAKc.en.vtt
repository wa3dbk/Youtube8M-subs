00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.930 
trouble and cup in the ball I have a lot
of<00:03:53.989> workouts<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.470> show<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.769> how<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.430> match<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
of workouts to show you how to match the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.339 
of workouts to show you how to match the
different<00:03:56.150> dribble<00:03:56.630> behavior

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
different dribble behavior

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.750 
different dribble behavior
because<00:03:57.590> every<00:03:57.890> driven<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.189> drill<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.579> not

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
because every driven the drill is not

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.330 
because every driven the drill is not
the<00:03:59.299> same<00:03:59.569> it<00:03:59.989> teach<00:04:00.260> different<00:04:00.859> parts<00:04:01.249> of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
the same it teach different parts of

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.679 
the same it teach different parts of
your<00:04:01.459> dribbling<00:04:01.879> behavior<00:04:04.180> my<00:04:05.180> hands<00:04:05.420> get

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
your dribbling behavior my hands get

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.360 
your dribbling behavior my hands get
will<00:04:05.900> draw<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.439> that's<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.799> lot<00:04:06.950> of<00:04:06.980> times<00:04:07.219> where

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
will draw so that's a lot of times where

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.030 
will draw so that's a lot of times where
I<00:04:07.400> turn<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.790> ball<00:04:07.969> over<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.359> fumbly<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.859> this

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
I turn the ball over and fumbly so this

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.300 
I turn the ball over and fumbly so this
drill<00:04:10.219> called<00:04:10.579> pal<00:04:11.680> parallel<00:04:12.680> behind<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.129> base

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
drill called pal parallel behind a base

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.949 
drill called pal parallel behind a base
is<00:04:13.430> similar<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.939> the<00:04:14.030> crossover<00:04:14.540> but<00:04:14.750> this

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
is similar to the crossover but this

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.009 
is similar to the crossover but this
drill<00:04:15.200> really<00:04:15.489> makes<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.880> jump<00:04:17.209> stop<00:04:17.509> behind

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
drill really makes that jump stop behind

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.689 
drill really makes that jump stop behind
the<00:04:18.199> back<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.859> new<00:04:19.190> breakdown<00:04:19.669> of

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
the back I have a new breakdown of

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.150 
the back I have a new breakdown of
different<00:04:20.359> variations<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:21.590> move<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
different variations to move like the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.189 
different variations to move like the
crossover<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.759> between<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.300> legs<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.750> inside

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
crossover the between the legs to inside

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.670 
crossover the between the legs to inside
out<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.919> some<00:04:25.250> spins<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.990> see<00:04:26.990> I'm<00:04:27.320> not<00:04:27.530> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
out and some spins to see I'm not the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.920 
out and some spins to see I'm not the
nicest<00:04:27.889> player<00:04:28.250> yeah<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.580> messed<00:04:29.030> up<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.479> love
