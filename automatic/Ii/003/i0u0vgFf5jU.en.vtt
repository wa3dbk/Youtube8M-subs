00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pretty much as simple as that so you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.510 
pretty much as simple as that so you
then<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.770> sure<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> ticked<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.080 
suppose if you really want to press ok
and<00:01:28.770> you'll<00:01:28.890> notice<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.189> Google<00:01:29.790> has<00:01:29.939> now

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and you'll notice that Google has now

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.850 
and you'll notice that Google has now
loaded<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.560> desktop<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.030> can

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
loaded up on my desktop now I can

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
loaded up on my desktop now I can
maximize<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.490> maximize<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
maximize I think this one maximize is it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
maximize I think this one maximize is it
but<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> icon<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.860> use

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
but you can see the icon so you can use

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
but you can see the icon so you can use
them<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.360> maximizes<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
them I think that one maximizes it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.469 
them I think that one maximizes it
completely<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.520> close<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
completely and you can close it now I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.730 
completely and you can close it now I
can<00:01:42.689> move<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.200> anywhere<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.710> my

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
can move this about anywhere on my

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800 
can move this about anywhere on my
desktop<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
desktop so you can kind of use it as a
