happens<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.079> when<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.290> crash<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.829> goes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
happens you see when you crash it goes

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.069 
happens you see when you crash it goes
into<00:02:34.250> slow<00:02:34.489> motion<00:02:34.549> which<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.299> great<00:02:35.600> just

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
into slow motion which is great just

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.199 
into slow motion which is great just
quite<00:02:36.380> cool

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
quite cool

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.710 
quite cool
now<00:02:38.209> steering<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.049> it's<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.549> hard<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.209> be

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
now steering it it's not that hard to be

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.380 
now steering it it's not that hard to be
honest<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.359> perfect<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.590> perfect

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
honest it's just a perfect it's perfect

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.210 
honest it's just a perfect it's perfect
so<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> brake<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.109> hold<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.560> screen<00:02:48.950> you

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so it's a brake you hold the screen you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.210 
so it's a brake you hold the screen you
see<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:53.780> go<00:02:54.049> on<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.200> grass<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.739> slows<00:02:55.040> you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
see don't go on the grass it slows you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.759 
see don't go on the grass it slows you
down<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.430> lot<00:02:55.730> I'm<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:56.930> good<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.200> racing

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
down a lot I'm not really good at racing

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.750 
down a lot I'm not really good at racing
games<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.810> very<00:03:00.019> out<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.950> what<00:03:01.340> I've<00:03:01.489> seen

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
games so it's very out of what I've seen

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
games so it's very out of what I've seen
so<00:03:02.030> far<00:03:02.299> it's<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.690> great<00:03:03.170> racing<00:03:03.739> game

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
so far it's a great racing game

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.069 
so far it's a great racing game
