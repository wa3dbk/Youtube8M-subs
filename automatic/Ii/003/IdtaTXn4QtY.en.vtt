put it on and with me Becky Masterman
head<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> bee<00:00:26.760> squad<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
head of the bee squad we're going to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
smoke them a little bit so that they are

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
smoke them a little bit so that they are

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
nice and calm

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.840 
nice and calm
we're<00:00:31.109> looking<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.040> first<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.610> see

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
we're looking down in there first to see

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.510 
we're looking down in there first to see
where<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> bees<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.050> located<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.160> frames

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
where the bees are located which frames

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.540 
where the bees are located which frames
that<00:00:35.820> they're<00:00:36.059> on

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
that they're on

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
that they're on
so<00:00:38.550> we'll<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> couple<00:00:39.360> frames<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.140> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so we'll take a couple frames out so we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
so we'll take a couple frames out so we
can<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> they're<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.850> doing<00:00:42.000> as

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
can see that they're actually doing as

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.119 
can see that they're actually doing as
well<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:43.920> got

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
well as we think they're this has got

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
well as we think they're this has got
honey<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.239> some<00:00:45.780> pollen<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> frame<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
honey and some pollen and this frame is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.420 
honey and some pollen and this frame is
being<00:00:52.860> used<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.640> they're<00:00:54.629> using<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.440> least

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
being used and so they're using at least

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
being used and so they're using at least
all<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.449> eight<00:00:57.690> frames<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.829> what

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
all of these first eight frames so what

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.180 
all of these first eight frames so what

will bring those bees up here so they

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.620 
will bring those bees up here so they
start<00:02:00.850> using<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.479> top<00:02:01.780> box<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:03.009> can<00:02:03.420> take<00:02:04.420> out

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
start using this top box we can take out

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.550 
start using this top box we can take out
the<00:02:04.869> entrance<00:02:05.350> reducer<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.170> will<00:02:11.380> give

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the entrance reducer now that will give

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.820 
the entrance reducer now that will give
the<00:02:11.739> bees<00:02:12.060> room<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.330> expand<00:02:13.900> they'll<00:02:14.500> start

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the bees room to expand they'll start

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.550 
the bees room to expand they'll start
filling<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.430> third<00:02:15.760> box<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.510> brood<00:02:17.230> and

filling this third box with brood and
with<00:02:17.680> honey<00:02:17.920> when<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.730> box<00:02:19.030> gets<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.840> be<00:02:20.019> 80%

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
with honey when this box gets to be 80%

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.979 
with honey when this box gets to be 80%
full<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.239> we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> do<00:02:22.810> is

full then what we're going to do is

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.710 
full then what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.350> reverse<00:02:23.739> these<00:02:24.430> two<00:02:25.150> boxes

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
we're going to reverse these two boxes
