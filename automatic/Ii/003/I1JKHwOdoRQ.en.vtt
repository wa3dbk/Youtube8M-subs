-<00:00:35.329> in<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.540> tutorial<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.860> using<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
- in this tutorial we will be using a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.799 
- in this tutorial we will be using a
Behringer<00:00:38.850> BCF<00:00:39.780> mm<00:00:40.590> midi<00:00:40.860> controller<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:42.629> need

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
Behringer BCF mm midi controller we need

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170 
Behringer BCF mm midi controller we need
to<00:00:42.960> tell<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> software<00:00:43.469> which<00:00:44.070> midi<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.670> DMX

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
to tell the software which midi or DMX

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
to tell the software which midi or DMX
port<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.750> read<00:00:45.930> from<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> done<00:00:47.640> in

the<00:00:55.309> next<00:00:55.610> step<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.600> map<00:00:56.809> each<00:00:57.050> dial<00:00:57.440> button

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
the next step is to map each dial button
