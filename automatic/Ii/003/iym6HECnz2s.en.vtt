00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 Oscar was invited to the selection 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.259
 for the two friendly matches is the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.730
 have a chat and we are in the neighborhood 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.100
 debating in southwest london 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 in this set of buildings live many 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 chelsea players because the stadium 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 everything is well close 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 this apartment here is still being 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.080
 occupied by the chelsea reinforcement in this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 season of the main reinforcements of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:39.270
 Brazilian cars take another one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:41.550
 Fifth was very cool, you did 21 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.129
 years here at chelsea 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 Did you already feel prepared like this? 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 professionally for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 come and play in the big clubs of 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.829
 world only if it was prepared for 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 me with a great club to start already 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 after a week is already beginning to be 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.410
 holder to the pitch proved 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 very impressed, I 'm not already 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.629
 showing their credentials in that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 saw his first game on the screen by 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 Champions League 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 at 22 minutes and then I was 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
 Seeking to be different I think 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.060
 that eh eh eh a very strong dynamic is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.869
 the game does not then I'm okay 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.869
 adapting to it 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.899
 strans exchange 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.119
 I found the alliance that gives a taste of 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.750
 usp for the goal that everything will be now 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.729
 that here in jest is going to be a competitor right? 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.319
 now our commentator in brazil 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.039
 career said 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.840
 The goal scored a goal on Sunday. 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.549
 without intending to give him half a moon 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.469
 tried to dominate had approximation of the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.539
 defender he had agility to 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.409
 coordinate to make the case of gold know 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.079
 I think it was a beautiful goal but sometimes 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.239
 beautiful go happens as soon as chance goes 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.780
 fall hit on the fly in confirmed here 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.209
 huh 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 and this perspective of facing the 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.950
 corinthians 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.500
 I'm anxious to play with 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 corinthians to go out with the world championship more 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.459
 since I went with the inter and I ended up 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.259
 losing then I want to try to win the 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.310
 world today you also think that 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.470
 no one had not known each other 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.209
 corinthians with ronaldo was playing in 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.930
 Corinthians who put at risk 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.519
 known worldwide its relation with the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.769
 Corinthians to give life confessed that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.680
 I was a Corinthian when I was a boy, not me. 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.290
 I do not think I was as a child are 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.560
 Pauline then 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.239
 europe the validity right to say to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.939
 You're a mission to win a title. 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.609
 who has already competed and failed to win and 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.959
 also facing an old rival is not 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.299
 you had 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.250
 It is very tasty as play had 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.799
 Brazilians intimately as with the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.799
 best products threat spend
