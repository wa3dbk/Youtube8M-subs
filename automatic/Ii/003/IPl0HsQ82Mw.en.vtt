go right on top of them again so take

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.709 
go right on top of them again so take
the<00:01:47.649> clams<00:01:47.920> out<00:01:48.090> putting<00:01:49.090> them<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.359> colander

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719

so crispy that it's you know to word so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.470 
so crispy that it's you know to word so
then<00:02:31.410> let's<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.340> I'll<00:02:32.670> show<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
then let's not go and I'll show you the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.230 
then let's not go and I'll show you the
next<00:02:33.660> step<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:35.220> bacon<00:02:35.550> cooks<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> few

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
next step my bacon cooks for a few

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.300 
next step my bacon cooks for a few
minutes<00:02:36.540> taking<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.770> skillet<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
minutes taking it out of the skillet and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.730 
minutes taking it out of the skillet and
also<00:02:38.760> pick<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:39.690> bacon<00:02:40.080> tends<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.440> release<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
also pick up bacon tends to release a

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.830 
also pick up bacon tends to release a
lot<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.190> fat<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.520> what<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.360> drain

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
lot of fat so what I do is I just drain

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.220 
lot of fat so what I do is I just drain
it<00:02:42.870> completely<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.820> want<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it completely I don't want the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.430 
it completely I don't want the
overpowering<00:02:46.830> baking<00:02:47.580> flavor<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.690> literally

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
overpowering baking flavor to literally

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
overpowering baking flavor to literally
overpower<00:02:50.100> everything<00:02:50.400> else<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.270> just

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
overpower everything else so I just

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410 
overpower everything else so I just
remove<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.920> add<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.490> couple

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
remove it and then I add a couple

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.640 
remove it and then I add a couple
tablespoons<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.410> olive<00:02:55.950> oil<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.640> my<00:02:56.760> skillet<00:02:57.090> I

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
tablespoons of olive oil to my skillet I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.350 
tablespoons of olive oil to my skillet I
think<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:58.980> I've<00:02:59.130> reduced<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.640> heat<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.270> about

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
think now I've reduced the heat to about

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.080 
think now I've reduced the heat to about
medium<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.290> I'm<00:03:01.710> going<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> add<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.310> my<00:03:02.520> Fresno

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.030 
my parsley and my garlic mmm Fresno it's
got<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.790> sort<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.300> subtle<00:03:09.870> fruity<00:03:10.710> key

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
got a really sort of subtle fruity key

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.210 
got a really sort of subtle fruity key
that<00:03:11.460> I<00:03:11.570> adore<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.350> take<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> seeds<00:03:14.010> out

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that I adore and I take the seeds out

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.730 
that I adore and I take the seeds out
but<00:03:14.460> it's<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.700> too<00:03:15.030> too<00:03:15.330> spicy<00:03:15.630> but<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.590> can

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
but it's not too too spicy but you can

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.830 
but it's not too too spicy but you can
certainly<00:03:17.010> leave<00:03:17.220> them<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.490> now<00:03:18.390> while<00:03:18.630> this

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
certainly leave them in now while this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.540 
certainly leave them in now while this
is<00:03:19.110> going<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.770> will<00:03:19.890> only<00:03:20.040> take<00:03:20.190> about<00:03:20.490> a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
is going this will only take about a

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.720 
is going this will only take about a
minute<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.680> perfect<00:03:23.010> time<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
minute or so it's the perfect time to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000 
minute or so it's the perfect time to
add<00:03:23.970> my<00:03:24.270> linguine<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.960> my<00:03:25.110> boiling<00:03:25.410> salted

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
water so that's what I'm going to go do

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.150 
water so that's what I'm going to go do
