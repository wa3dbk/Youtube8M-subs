you<00:05:32.830> guys<00:05:33.040> a<00:05:34.440> few<00:05:35.440> things<00:05:35.650> like<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.100> talked

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
you guys a few things like I talked

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.850 
you guys a few things like I talked
about<00:05:36.520> it<00:05:36.910> doesn't<00:05:37.240> move<00:05:37.419> too<00:05:37.750> much<00:05:37.780> or<00:05:38.290> does

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
about it doesn't move too much or does

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.520 
about it doesn't move too much or does
mu<00:05:39.100> but<00:05:39.370> it's<00:05:39.550> a<00:05:39.790> lot<00:05:40.360> harder<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.990> move<00:05:41.169> than

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
mu but it's a lot harder to move than

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.000 
mu but it's a lot harder to move than
the<00:05:41.710> original<00:05:42.220> apple<00:05:42.669> TV<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:44.380> lot<00:05:44.620> smaller

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
the original apple TV and a lot smaller

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.680 
the original apple TV and a lot smaller
and<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:46.660> does<00:05:46.840> not<00:05:46.990> heat<00:05:47.230> up<00:05:47.260> as<00:05:47.590> much<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.419> I

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
and it does not heat up as much and so I

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.659 
and it does not heat up as much and so I
probably<00:05:49.990> won't<00:05:50.320> be<00:05:50.590> making<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:51.040> review<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
probably won't be making a review on the

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.190 
probably won't be making a review on the
Apple<00:05:52.000> TV<00:05:52.360> so<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.200> hope<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.770> guys
