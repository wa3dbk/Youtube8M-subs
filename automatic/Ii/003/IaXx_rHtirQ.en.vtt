 just a straw to watch and then 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.140
 we will find ourselves in the next 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 videos so at first the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 gift that I wanted since super super 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.420
 long time 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.530
 they were offered to me by my darling I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.879
 you put a picture on instagram 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.230
 by the way if you want to join me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 on instagram you have the link a bar 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 of a fake and it's actually a pair of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.629
 shoes that comes from texting 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 it's a pair of boots and wait 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.899
 I feel that this is how 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.470
 is what they present themselves they are 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.420
 in fact all black leather not patent but 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400
 this is a brilliant leather anyway 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.830
 and so on the front you have a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
 opening here and the foot and so 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.979
 winners toes are in the air 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.560
 free 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.700
 so that's how they are and you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 have a small zipper 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.509
 behind that it's been a long time since I 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 wanted this pair of shoes the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.060
 jelly already not imported I think 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.640
 you can see it and I love them too much 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.040
 what and here I was super happy 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.729
 when I saw there was this gift under 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 the foot of the fir 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.270
 I also saw 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.430
 if a little kit called this is the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 my relaxation kit the guide of 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.630
 relaxation techniques 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.700
 so he shows up like that with a 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 eye mask 14 hot stones 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.580
 hot stones for a relaxing massage 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 and the little booklet on how 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 make it a stone massage 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.630
 hot 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.580
 so that I am hyper hyper content 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.659
 because the hot stone massage 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 it's something that interests me 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.899
 really a moment and at the right eye the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.810
 so know so here I can read that 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.310
 and for that they would like editing 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.590
 these marabouts if you ever want 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.090
 find the book is so here is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.410
 I was really happy I have not got it yet 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.330
 had time to use it because 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 unfortunately the holidays are not 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 finished and I still work a lot 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 but here I was really very very 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.470
 Then just as good of anna trice 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.239
 tea I also got a mug so I 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.650
 will show you the box because I 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.930
 find it really too beautiful if 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.090
 I can close it's here it is 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 like that so frankly I like 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.319
 a lot a lot the packaging is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.299
 quite my kind and my style is 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.000
 so that was offered to me by a couple 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.829
 of friends and I think she found that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.570
 at the store that's called noise in 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.510
 the kitchen if you're interested 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.280
 and so you have this store at close 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.320
 from home so I could read about it 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.120
 that it's a double porcelain fashion 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.780
 insulating wall so that is to say that it 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.900
 preserve 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.700
 it keeps the heat and it's great 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.420
 beautiful there is writing so you are great 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.250
 here was extraordinary behind so 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.350
 I thought it was so cute it's with her 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.880
 the little rubber cap see at 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.530
 inside and I'm not sure yet 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.579
 served but it will not be long 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.799
 that I really find it too much 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.390
 beautiful and good they know that's it 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.709
 I love tea and it's really 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.870
 something I'm going to use 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.579
 but completely everyday so 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.150
 here I really did not find too much 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.250
 1000 and with that the same could not happen 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.390
 to fool I was hyper hyper happy 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.200
 besides I am always 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.300
 they offered me the box 2 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.200
 thigh mitis if you follow my chain 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 for a little while you've already seen 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.599
 technos on my channel since I 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 have all the time 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.849
 and there I had more so I think 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.090
 that they felt inside there is the 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.800
 spicy chocolate stained black there is tea 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.000

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.849

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.190

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.599
 red fruits with vanilla and caramel 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.419
 for a moment I only listened to the one at the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.100
 fashion but but I'm sure I'm going 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.500
 all is to love in any case I have everything 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.120
 felt and I loved it and inside 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.620
 what must be here there was the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.060
 little tea ball I can not you the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.490

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.070
 my sink waiting for lava and may 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.810
 So here but with there was little 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.780
 ball and I find it hyper hyper well 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.660
 because disgust I have several months 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.830
 but who come from hema and they do not 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.060
 are not necessarily of good quality a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.770
 once we raise that had several 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.570
 it does not close properly 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.860
 so after tea strolls in the in 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.169
 the cup is really not practical 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.280
 but here I was really too much 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.380
 too happy 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.400
 and if you go through there I make you 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.310
 very very big kisses thank you 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.990
 again and the last little present that 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.729

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.960
 was a small complement of gifts in 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.490
 any case for what I wanted 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.160

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.320
 to be bg a lot of small envelopes 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.850
 money but that's the gift I can 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.590
 to show you it's actually boxes 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.660

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.539
 like that and these are the same all to 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.460

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.580
 so I'm trying to show that's the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.410
 waist down everything was going from their 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.849
 covered and I can not wait to have a 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.620
 apartment a little bigger because 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.970
 there it is small but when I put a 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.770
 bigger apartment I could them 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.720
 stacked on top of each other and that 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.960
 will be very very pretty so here is the most 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.000
