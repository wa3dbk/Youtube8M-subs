00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello how about friends confirm today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.970
 we bring a new video for you in 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.940
 this occasion is a comparison between the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.710
 Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Samsung Galaxy is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 min interest and two of the best 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.960
 phones in each of its high ranges 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 and average respectively in this video 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 let's analyze what differences he put 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 samsung between these two computers to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 offer a man is I lower plus not 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.189
 a product of poor quality we will make a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 test tally unlike many 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 physical aspects we will try to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 speed of its processors and by 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 last we will do a speed test in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 Internet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 let's start let's start with its aspects 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.680
 physical the samsung galaxy s3 has a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.480
 thickness of 8.6 millimeters that if you've 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 had the opportunity to have it in your 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.890
 hands it feels very comfortable something that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.219
 It also happens on the Samsung Galaxy S3 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.410
 mini with a thickness of 9.9 mm that 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.840
 it can be considered a reasonable thickness 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.270
 for a mid-range phone the weight 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 of the galaxy s3 millen decreases that is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.859
 something that we appreciate we have only 111 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.790
 points 5 grams while in the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.960
 samsung galaxy s3 we have 133 grams of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 all ways in both 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 this is very well proportioned and we 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.409
 we feel discomfort in no time 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 the screen is a detail by which 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 samsung always leaves us with the mouth 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 open and surprised although in the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 samsung galaxy s 3000 and we have a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 resolution of 800 x 480 pixels the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.790
 image quality is incomparable already 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.190
 that we have a screen that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.200
 custom is super amoled and in the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.909
 samsung galaxy disinterest we have the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.140
 same screen but this time with the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.880
 surprising resolution of 1280 x 720 h 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 that you have had the opportunity to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 see it you will know that it is one of the best 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.789
 saturation is perfect and also that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.289
 are designed not to consume much 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.630
 battery that is a problem with which 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.700
 we are in other smartphones 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.259
 also on both devices 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 we found a gorilla of the two which 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.690
 protects the device from scratches and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.149
 slight bumps when we refer to mini 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's not just for your specifications but 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.789
 also for its screen since samsung 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.039
 decides to reduce from 4.8 to 4 inches 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.160
 feel very good in your hand now let's go 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 to focus on its technical aspects the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.250
 storage in the galaxy s3 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.100
 is 16 32 and 64 GB that can be 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.440
 expand 64 gigabytes more per card 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.790
 microsd while on the samsung 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.520
 galaxy s3 mini 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 we have 8 and 16 gb 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.440
 internal storage and we can 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.040
 expand 32 gigabytes more per card 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.020
 microsd now we will move to ram 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.850
 something that users who use 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.190
 many applications at the same time 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 the samsung galaxy s3 is too interesting 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.110
 in its time it has a range phone 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.060
 high with a ram gb was the best 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.370
 but now here so many phones in the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 market of the same range but with 2 GB 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.080
 of ram would happen to have a negative point 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.540
 something that was improved with a new samsung 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.850
 galaxy s 4 but now the samsung galaxy 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 s3 mini is considered a telephone 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 mid- range also has a gb of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.640
 ram something enviable for the price that 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.290
 has the camera is another aspect in the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 which many of the users are fixed 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.550
 both teams have excellent cameras 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.519
 as for photography the samsung galaxy 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.160
 s3 has 8 megapixels while the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.140
 samsung galaxy s3 mini has 5 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.370
 megapixels in terms of video 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.190
 The Samsung Galaxy S3 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.340
 in a resolution of 1080 p full hd 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.440
 while the samsung galaxy s 3000 records 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.330
 video in 720 p h of both devices 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.540
 have living android and everything 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.329
 the backup of everyone suite in the version 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.220
 412 we will pass to your processor on samsung 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.709
 galaxy s3 has an exynos processor 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.720
 manufactured by the samsung itself which 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.450
 is quad core and runs a frequency of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.030
 1.4 giga hertz while the samsung 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.430
 galaxy s3 mini uses a processor not 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 actor which is manufactured by ericsson 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.049
 and that is dual core but runs a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.690
 frequency one giga hertz last 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.120
 Samsung Galaxy S3 battery is of 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000
 2100 milliamps and on the samsung galaxy 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.370
 s3 mini we find 1500 milliamperes 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.709
 but as I said before in the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.049
 screen of these equipments is thrifty 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.810
 of battery for which we will last what 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.130
 sufficiently necessary or that friends 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.049
 of hand computation we have reached the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.850
 end of this video both devices 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 They are very good about their bed 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.229
 We have excellent specifications 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.340
 techniques when buying everything 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.870
 depends on your budget 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.449
 and so you think about using the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.740
 device like the two are going to suffer 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.180
 all your needs 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.610

 next
