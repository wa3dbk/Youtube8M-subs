00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
but it also comes in an aluminum model

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.299 
but it also comes in an aluminum model
and<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.600> 2698<00:01:01.600> model<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.379> here<00:01:03.219> are

twelve and a half inches tall up to the
the<00:01:08.410> red<00:01:08.619> line<00:01:09.069> here<00:01:09.429> and<00:01:09.580> it's<00:01:10.420> 13<00:01:11.050> and

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
the red line here and it's 13 and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.040 
the red line here and it's 13 and
three-quarter<00:01:11.979> inches<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.429> diameter<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.720> is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
three-quarter inches in diameter it is

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.389 
three-quarter inches in diameter it is
big<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:15.280> holds<00:01:15.670> five<00:01:15.970> point<00:01:16.330> eight<00:01:16.479> quarts<00:01:16.899> of

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
big it holds five point eight quarts of

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.669 
big it holds five point eight quarts of
kerosene<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.610> again<00:01:19.090> use<00:01:19.300> k1<00:01:19.959> which<00:01:20.440> will

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
kerosene and again use k1 which will

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.889 
kerosene and again use k1 which will
give<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.979> much<00:01:21.160> cleaner<00:01:21.459> burn<00:01:21.819> and<00:01:22.119> it

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
give you a much cleaner burn and it

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.389 
give you a much cleaner burn and it
burns<00:01:23.470> roughly<00:01:24.039> 17<00:01:24.580> ounces<00:01:25.149> an<00:01:25.330> hour<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.280> you

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
burns roughly 17 ounces an hour so you

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.350 
burns roughly 17 ounces an hour so you
should<00:01:27.849> get<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:29.410> burn<00:01:29.770> rate<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.550> 11<00:01:31.090> hours

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
should get up to a burn rate of 11 hours

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.199 
should get up to a burn rate of 11 hours
out<00:01:31.599> of<00:01:31.690> one<00:01:31.869> tank<00:01:32.369> let<00:01:33.369> me<00:01:33.489> go<00:01:33.910> over<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.179> a

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
out of one tank let me go over it a

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:41.550 
out of one tank let me go over it a
little<00:01:34.360> bit<00:01:34.660> with<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:39.989> it's<00:01:40.989> much<00:01:41.289> more

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
little bit with you it's much more

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.510 
little bit with you it's much more
robust<00:01:42.039> than<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.369> sixteen<00:01:43.000> wick<00:01:43.920> model<00:01:44.920> it

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
robust than the sixteen wick model it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.940 
robust than the sixteen wick model it
has<00:01:45.580> two<00:01:46.030> built-in<00:01:46.420> handles<00:01:46.899> right<00:01:47.590> here<00:01:47.800> on

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
has two built-in handles right here on

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.550 
has two built-in handles right here on
the<00:01:48.099> sides<00:01:48.399> look<00:01:49.090> at<00:01:49.239> that<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:52.319> really<00:01:53.319> large

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
the sides look at that a really large

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.429 
the sides look at that a really large
ring<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:58.200> pops<00:01:59.200> off

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
ring this pops off

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.609 
ring this pops off
and<00:02:00.939> look<00:02:01.939> at<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.210> size<00:02:02.539> of<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:02.869> catalytic

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
and look at the size of this catalytic

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.290 
and look at the size of this catalytic
converter<00:02:04.960> quite<00:02:05.960> impressive<00:02:10.000> again<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.150> has

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
converter quite impressive again it has

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.780 
converter quite impressive again it has
a<00:02:11.330> fuel<00:02:11.690> gauge<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:13.580> cap<00:02:13.819> for<00:02:14.440> refilling<00:02:15.440> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
a fuel gauge and a cap for refilling it

and the burner assembly again is a

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.690 
and the burner assembly again is a
compression<00:02:20.720> fitting<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.310> know<00:02:22.430> don't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
compression fitting so you know don't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.780

that<00:02:49.340> there's<00:02:49.549> no<00:02:49.700> water<00:02:50.030> because<00:02:50.959> again<00:02:51.260> with

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that there's no water because again with

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.110 
that there's no water because again with
these<00:02:52.099> cotton<00:02:52.519> wicks<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.299> soaks<00:02:53.959> up<00:02:54.170> water

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
these cotton wicks if it soaks up water

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.180 
these cotton wicks if it soaks up water
it's<00:02:56.120> gonna<00:02:56.299> prohibit<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.260> good<00:02:57.860> flow<00:02:58.160> of

it's gonna prohibit a good flow of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.039 
it's gonna prohibit a good flow of
kerosene<00:02:59.150> absorption<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:01.870> receive<00:03:02.870> your

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
stove the wicks aren't going to be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.539 
stove the wicks aren't going to be
installed<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.769> done<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.069> exact<00:03:07.370> same

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
installed but it's done the exact same

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.550 
installed but it's done the exact same
way<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:08.090> installed<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.870> wicks<00:03:09.049> on<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
way that we installed the wicks on the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.910 
way that we installed the wicks on the
16<00:03:10.250> wick<00:03:10.459> stove<00:03:11.019> just<00:03:12.019> take<00:03:12.230> your<00:03:12.380> cotton<00:03:12.590> wick

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
and put it over the hook okay and make

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.770 
and put it over the hook okay and make
sure<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.920> your<00:03:19.069> burner<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.670> as<00:03:20.209> high<00:03:20.420> as<00:03:20.450> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
sure that your burner is as high as it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.780 
sure that your burner is as high as it
will<00:03:20.870> go<00:03:20.930> turn<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.920> all<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.190> way<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.579> right

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
will go turn it all the way to the right

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.250 
will go turn it all the way to the right
and<00:03:24.310> okay<00:03:25.310> see<00:03:25.639> I've<00:03:25.970> already<00:03:26.180> installed<00:03:26.660> most

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
and okay see I've already installed most

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.590 
and okay see I've already installed most
of<00:03:27.440> these<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.799> just<00:03:28.670> stick<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.209> up<00:03:29.389> through

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
of these and just stick it up through

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.820 
of these and just stick it up through
the<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.139> tube<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:31.280> so

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.080 

okay<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.990> real<00:03:40.200> simple<00:03:40.440> process<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.280> pull

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
okay it's a real simple process and pull

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.750 
okay it's a real simple process and pull
it<00:03:42.210> up<00:03:42.330> see<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:45.470> then<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.680> use<00:03:47.070> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
it up see that and then I use the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.970 
it up see that and then I use the
toothpick<00:03:48.270> trick<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:50.690> that's<00:03:51.690> going<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.110> make

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
toothpick trick and that's going to make

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.630 
toothpick trick and that's going to make
them<00:03:53.220> all<00:03:53.400> roughly<00:03:54.590> adjusted<00:03:55.590> let's<00:03:56.220> see<00:03:56.460> it's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
them all roughly adjusted let's see it's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.190 
them all roughly adjusted let's see it's
this<00:03:56.820> tube<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:58.190> see<00:03:59.190> that<00:04:01.760> okay<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.660> just

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
this tube here see that okay and just

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.920 
this tube here see that okay and just
pull<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.770> out<00:04:05.180> now<00:04:06.180> I've<00:04:06.390> been<00:04:06.600> told<00:04:06.840> that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
pull that out now I've been told that

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.290 
pull that out now I've been told that
when<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.110> initially<00:04:10.770> burn<00:04:10.980> this<00:04:11.220> it's<00:04:12.000> going

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
when you initially burn this it's going

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.410 
when you initially burn this it's going
to<00:04:12.420> cut<00:04:13.290> these<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.650> half<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.310> instead<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:14.940> 22

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
to cut these in half so instead of 22

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.300 
to cut these in half so instead of 22
weeks<00:04:15.600> there's<00:04:15.840> actually<00:04:16.140> 44<00:04:16.650> wicks<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:17.130> this

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
weeks there's actually 44 wicks in this

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.140 
weeks there's actually 44 wicks in this
that's<00:04:17.670> why<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.030> gets<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.450> hot

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
that's why it gets so hot

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.120 
that's why it gets so hot
and<00:04:21.350> after<00:04:22.350> you've<00:04:22.530> burned<00:04:22.830> these<00:04:23.840> wicks<00:04:25.130> you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
and after you've burned these wicks you

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.250 
and after you've burned these wicks you
know<00:04:26.250> for<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> couple<00:04:26.700> hours<00:04:26.820> let<00:04:27.150> let<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.900> the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
know for a couple hours let let this the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.450 
know for a couple hours let let this the
machine<00:04:28.560> oils<00:04:28.920> burn<00:04:29.130> off<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> all<00:04:29.640> of<00:04:29.670> that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
machine oils burn off and all of that
