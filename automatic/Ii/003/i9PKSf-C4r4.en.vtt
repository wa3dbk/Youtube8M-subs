00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
Lawsky low speed turns are like way more

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.759 
Lawsky low speed turns are like way more
difficulty<00:02:30.849> than<00:02:31.180> high<00:02:31.510> speeds<00:02:31.900> second<00:02:32.680> I'm

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
difficulty than high speeds second I'm

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.050

like<00:02:55.330> low<00:02:55.840> speed<00:02:56.459> balancing<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.209> cannot

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
like low speed balancing that I cannot

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.470 
like low speed balancing that I cannot
do<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.560> then<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:02:59.950> I'm<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.209> bit<00:03:01.330> more

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
do and then I'm I'm just a bit more

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.540 
do and then I'm I'm just a bit more
ballsy<00:03:02.050> that's<00:03:02.260> about<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> bit

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
ballsy that's about it so I'm a bit

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.250 
ballsy that's about it so I'm a bit
better<00:03:03.849> at<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.209> high-speed<00:03:04.420> cornering<00:03:05.110> and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
better at like high-speed cornering and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380 
better at like high-speed cornering and
getting<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.769> further<00:03:06.069> down

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.020 

and<00:03:09.390> i<00:03:09.450> would<00:03:09.810> i<00:03:10.200> would<00:03:10.319> say<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.739> low<00:03:11.730> speed

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and i would i would say that low speed

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.399 
and i would i would say that low speed
corning<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.569> more<00:03:12.750> difficult<00:03:12.870> than<00:03:13.260> high

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
corning is more difficult than high

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.070 
corning is more difficult than high
speed

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
speed

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.440 
speed
loki<00:03:15.860> cornering<00:03:16.580> takes<00:03:16.880> skill<00:03:17.240> and

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
loki cornering takes skill and

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.390 
loki cornering takes skill and
high-speed<00:03:18.410> cornering<00:03:18.800> takes<00:03:19.280> courage

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
high-speed cornering takes courage

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.640 
high-speed cornering takes courage
