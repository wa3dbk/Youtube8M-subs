00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.720
 here I already have half cauliflower washed and 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.430
 cut into pieces of this size more or 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.020
 least do not make it too big or too 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.230
 small because then they will do the 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.080
 cauliflower pancakes is that I do not what 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.360
 make it so small more or less if 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.670
 has a smaller cauliflower 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.610
 use it all but this was great 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.360
 here I have boiling water I'm going to put 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.700
 a little bit of salt nothing more 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.390
 and I'll put here as cauliflower 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.580
 se se a little so it is not so 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.040
 it lasts for the time that we 're going to 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.300
 change here I 'm going to leave you some 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.340
 5 to 7 minutes to soften and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 now let's drain and we're going to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 let it cool 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.579
 Well, while it is cooking 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.190
 cauliflower I will make the caldillo a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 Once we are going to put it here I already have 3 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.410
 tomatoes with the 3 tomatoes a chili 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.390

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 a piece of garlic 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.600
 a little bit of cumin 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 as a bit more or less 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.870
 my son there who is talking and a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.390
 little bit of powder broth 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.880
 chicken broth powder sorry no 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.500
 they want to put salt and water to grind 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 we're going to grind it well and we're going 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.060
 to book well then let's start 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.830
 make these cauliflower pancakes and 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.680
 I have here cold is the cauliflower and the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.750
 I have already cold this is already I know 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.080
 drained now we 're going to put it here in 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.080
 flour 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.030
 and in the egg that already goes to you also to 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.030
 nougat point are three eggs 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 and we will be putting and for his 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.009
 oil already has to be hot 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.190
 so today we are going to be putting like this we are going to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.990
 go doing until you finish 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.140
 already your cardio has to be 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.710
 ready for now that we finish 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.690
 brown the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.210
 already 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.280
 you can do everything ready to eat 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.320
 and so he left a little short because 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.200
 I do not like it being hours and being sewn 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.720
 to brown them so fast 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.849
 they are crying so I'm going to do it 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 I will put as it is two or three or 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.490
 four 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.010
 and say let's put a paper in a 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.250
 dish with an absorbent paper like 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.850
 You can see that they are staying 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.950
 mild they have to give it everywhere 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.550
 Well, as you can see, I made all 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.320
 my tortillas 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.990
 and in the same pot a little bit of 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.990
 oil I already have my caldillo already ground 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.880
 sorry he raided my son 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 we are going to try to see what 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.140
 I'm going to add it to the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.140
 chicken broth powder 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.780
 good to add salt 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.530
 Well I put the chicken stock in 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.450
 dust and I put water 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.190
 also for why still see look 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.590
 then if the eyes are going to consume 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 all we will cover and let 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.020
 boil and boil we will add 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.819
 pancakes and ready is all but them 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.680
 like it and now let's see how it looks 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.200
 the saucer can accompany it with 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.510
 beans or rice or whatever you like 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.110
 and that he saw the caldillo we're going to 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.620
 add the pancakes 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.190
 let's go adding and now we're going to 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.210
 leave here about 23 more minutes so that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.430
 it is seasoned well 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.220
 and it's all they can eat with rice the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.050
 refried beans what you give them 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.380

 minutes here so that it is seasoned well 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.949
 and that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.820
 here, they had to have 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.000
 rectified its seasoning to see if it is already 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.940
 well and now 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.730

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.150
