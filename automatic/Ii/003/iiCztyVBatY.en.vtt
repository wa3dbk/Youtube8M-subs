00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.100 
of these bolts later on I don't think
I'll<00:04:47.610> make<00:04:47.639> any<00:04:48.000> more<00:04:48.120> these<00:04:48.270> at<00:04:48.479> level<00:04:48.810> 70

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
I'll make any more these at level 70

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.330 
I'll make any more these at level 70
I'll<00:04:49.199> part<00:04:49.380> just<00:04:49.500> make<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.889> long<00:04:50.070> bows<00:04:50.310> and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
I'll part just make you long bows and

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.310 
I'll part just make you long bows and
then<00:04:50.610> magical<00:04:51.000> humbles<00:04:51.300> just<00:04:51.479> because<00:04:51.810> these

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
then magical humbles just because these

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.170 
then magical humbles just because these
bolts<00:04:52.740> are<00:04:52.860> really<00:04:53.190> hard<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.460> sell<00:04:53.759> nowadays

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
bolts are really hard to sell nowadays

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.730 
bolts are really hard to sell nowadays
like<00:04:54.419> it's<00:04:54.599> I<00:04:54.720> think<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.169> might<00:04:55.289> lose<00:04:55.410> clip<00:04:55.650> it

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
like it's I think I might lose clip it

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.680 
like it's I think I might lose clip it
on<00:04:55.800> money<00:04:55.949> off<00:04:56.070> these<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.460> off<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.270> longbows

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
on money off these and off you longbows

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.719 
on money off these and off you longbows
you<00:04:57.870> profit<00:04:58.289> basically<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:58.949> I<00:04:59.130> mean<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.550> guess

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
you profit basically so I mean I guess

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.460 
you profit basically so I mean I guess
it's<00:05:00.240> quite<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.449> big<00:05:00.599> difference<00:05:00.930> but<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.199> mean

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
it's quite a big difference but I mean

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.140 
it's quite a big difference but I mean
whatever<00:05:01.620> my<00:05:01.919> computer<00:05:02.340> my<00:05:02.550> actual<00:05:02.849> that

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
whatever my computer my actual that

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.790 
whatever my computer my actual that
computer<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.659> was<00:05:03.750> shaken<00:05:04.110> because<00:05:04.229> the

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
computer and I was shaken because the

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.290 
computer and I was shaken because the
way<00:05:04.919> I'm<00:05:05.039> moving<00:05:05.310> my<00:05:05.340> hand<00:05:05.669> like<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.970> could<00:05:06.120> see
