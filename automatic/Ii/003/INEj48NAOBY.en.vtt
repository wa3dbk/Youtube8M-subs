00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

just<00:00:00.329> these<00:00:00.510> are<00:00:00.659> just<00:00:00.920> pulling<00:00:01.920> them<00:00:02.010> up

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
just these are just pulling them up

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.210 
just these are just pulling them up
right<00:00:02.429> so<00:00:03.419> that<00:00:03.570> that's<00:00:04.560> all<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:05.009> whole

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
right so that that's all this whole

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.550 
right so that that's all this whole
extra<00:00:05.640> stuff<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.870> not<00:00:06.990> really<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.529> looks

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
extra stuff is it's not really it looks

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.350 
extra stuff is it's not really it looks
complex<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.429> first<00:00:08.670> when<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.910> understand

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
complex at first when you understand

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.450 
complex at first when you understand
this<00:00:09.960> gives<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.380> up<00:00:10.530> right<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.010> these<00:00:11.219> are

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
this gives you up right and these are

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.860 
this gives you up right and these are
core<00:00:11.639> break<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:12.030> legs<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.420> all<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.690> do

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
core break your legs it's all you do

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.079 
core break your legs it's all you do
then<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.130> attack<00:00:14.429> yourself<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
then you just attack yourself to the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.800 
then you just attack yourself to the
rope<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.350> what<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:17.240> is<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> main

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
rope so what we do is we have a main

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
rope so what we do is we have a main
attachment<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:19.590> three<00:00:19.800> bits<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
attachment for three bits but if this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.730 
attachment for three bits but if this
fails<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:22.080> want<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> fall<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
fails we don't want to fall to the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.670 
fails we don't want to fall to the
ground<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.400> use<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> backup<00:00:23.970> plan<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
ground so we use a backup plan so in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.920 
ground so we use a backup plan so in
this<00:00:25.800> scenario<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.670> use<00:00:26.930> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this scenario I'm just gonna use this

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.450 
this scenario I'm just gonna use this
little<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.590> another<00:00:28.949> type<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> an

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
little this is another type of an

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.720 
little this is another type of an
ascender<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.590> ready<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.550> its

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
ascender it's not ready to use on its

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.459 
ascender it's not ready to use on its
own<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.180> backup

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.160 

that's<00:00:36.039> the<00:00:36.190> thing

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:48.400 

I<00:00:40.539> start<00:00:41.539> climbing<00:00:42.309> just<00:00:43.309> like<00:00:43.520> one<00:00:43.850> in<00:00:47.410> now

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
I start climbing just like one in now

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.860 
I start climbing just like one in now
hanging<00:00:49.129> this<00:00:49.699> is<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.910> backup<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:50.600> it's<00:00:50.719> not

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
hanging this is a backup so it's not

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.750 
hanging this is a backup so it's not
really<00:00:51.079> doing<00:00:51.230> anything<00:00:51.559> yet<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.190> if<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:52.610> I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
really doing anything yet but if I if I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.170 
really doing anything yet but if I if I
fell<00:00:53.000> into<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.360> would<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.989> would<00:00:54.079> stop<00:00:54.350> they

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
fell into it would it would stop they

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.790 
fell into it would it would stop they
put<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.300> my<00:00:56.420> other<00:00:56.629> leg<00:00:59.140> and<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.260> way<00:01:00.409> it<00:01:00.530> works

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
put in my other leg and the way it works

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240 
put in my other leg and the way it works
is<00:01:01.479> everything's<00:01:02.479> in<00:01:02.629> an<00:01:02.750> alignment<00:01:03.100> so<00:01:04.100> that

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
is everything's in an alignment so that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.830 
is everything's in an alignment so that
way<00:01:04.399> they<00:01:04.550> don't<00:01:04.699> hit<00:01:04.909> one<00:01:05.119> another<00:01:05.149> just

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
way they don't hit one another just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.590 
way they don't hit one another just
spaced<00:01:06.110> out<00:01:06.460> now<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.490> couldn't<00:01:08.060> climb<00:01:08.270> just

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
spaced out now I couldn't climb just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.210 
spaced out now I couldn't climb just
like<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:09.350> said<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:09.920> kind<00:01:10.190> of

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
like this but like I said it's kind of

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.460 
like this but like I said it's kind of
hard<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.610> body<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.630> what<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:11.960> use<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.170> we

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
hard on the body so what we use is we

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.859 
hard on the body so what we use is we
put<00:01:12.679> put<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.190> rope<00:01:13.490> in<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:13.850> roller<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.690> then

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
put put the rope in this roller and then

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.230 
put put the rope in this roller and then
I<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.140> stand<00:01:15.440> up<00:01:18.490> see<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:19.700> when<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.690> sit<00:01:20.990> down
