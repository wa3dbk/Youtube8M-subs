00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
blog but there's only one way I could

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
blog but there's only one way I could
communicate<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.859> thing<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.400> cool

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
communicate one thing that's really cool
about<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.970> 810<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.480> wasn't<00:00:19.109> possible<00:00:19.289> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
about the 810 that wasn't possible to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.580 
about the 810 that wasn't possible to
800<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.310> that's<00:00:20.490> by<00:00:20.609> doing<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> video<00:00:21.150> now<00:00:21.869> it's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
800 and that's by doing a video now it's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.239 
800 and that's by doing a video now it's
set<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.919> the<00:00:23.579> uncompressed<00:00:24.300> raw<00:00:24.689> 14<00:00:25.529> bit<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
set to the uncompressed raw 14 bit so I

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.220 
set to the uncompressed raw 14 bit so I
was<00:00:26.400> shooting<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:26.820> big<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> file<00:00:27.509> as<00:00:27.659> possible

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
