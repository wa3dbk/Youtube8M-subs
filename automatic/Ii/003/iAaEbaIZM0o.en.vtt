00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you're going to need to make your loop

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.210 
you're going to need to make your loop
round<00:02:06.640> nose<00:02:06.880> pliers<00:02:07.380> grip<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.590> very<00:02:08.830> end<00:02:09.069> of

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
the wire and then it's a wrist action

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.830 
the wire and then it's a wrist action
just<00:02:12.340> bending<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.880> round<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.630> there

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
just bending it round you can see there

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.140 
just bending it round you can see there
you'll<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:14.350> half<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.920> loop<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:16.000> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you'll get about half the loop then you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.490 
you'll get about half the loop then you
need<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> move<00:02:16.690> around<00:02:17.970> finish<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> off<00:02:19.500> then

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
need to move around finish it off then

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.110 
need to move around finish it off then
I'm<00:02:20.709> going<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.890> take<00:02:21.040> another<00:02:21.190> eye<00:02:21.520> pin<00:02:21.880> and

I'm going to take another eye pin and
I'm<00:02:22.569> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.720> attach<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> again<00:02:26.050> put

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
I'm going to attach that so again put

another silver one don't forget it's

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.940 
another silver one don't forget it's
that<00:03:45.380> bending<00:03:45.800> over<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.670> start<00:03:46.970> with<00:03:47.950> cutting

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
that bending over to start with cutting

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.250 
that bending over to start with cutting
off<00:03:49.280> leave<00:03:50.120> yourself<00:03:50.269> about<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.630> centimetre

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
off leave yourself about a centimetre

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.810 
off leave yourself about a centimetre
and<00:03:52.870> make<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.019> loop<00:03:55.930> okay<00:03:56.959> then<00:03:57.709> another<00:03:58.580> eye

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
and make the loop okay then another eye

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.250 
and make the loop okay then another eye
pin<00:04:02.230> hang<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.410> one<00:04:03.470> off<00:04:03.739> there<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:06.080> it's

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
pin hang that one off there and it's

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.140 
pin hang that one off there and it's
these<00:04:06.440> links<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:06.950> give<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.220> movement<00:04:07.880> I

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
these links that give it the movement I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.820 
these links that give it the movement I
think<00:04:08.450> just<00:04:08.780> make<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.050> more<00:04:09.140> attractive<00:04:09.290> than

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
think just make it more attractive than

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.460 
think just make it more attractive than
if<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.100> was<00:04:10.190> all<00:04:10.310> on<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.489> straight<00:04:10.850> pin<00:04:11.320> I've<00:04:12.320> got

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
if it was all on a straight pin I've got

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.080 
if it was all on a straight pin I've got
little<00:04:12.620> millefiori<00:04:12.950> bead<00:04:13.550> there<00:04:13.820> which

and<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.610> can<00:04:22.730> just<00:04:22.880> keep<00:04:23.030> going<00:04:23.270> with<00:04:23.390> these

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
and you can just keep going with these

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.450 
and you can just keep going with these
as<00:04:23.720> many<00:04:23.900> times<00:04:24.200> as<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.470> like<00:04:24.500> really<00:04:25.040> I'm
