you<00:01:29.870> just<00:01:30.050> needed<00:01:30.230> energy<00:01:30.830> will<00:01:31.700> be

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
you just needed energy will be

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.170 
you just needed energy will be
stimulating<00:01:32.540> glycogenolysis<00:01:33.970> if<00:01:34.970> your

stimulating glycogenolysis if your

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.080 
stimulating glycogenolysis if your
glucose<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.750> low<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:37.070> glycogen<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.850> first

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
glucose is low so glycogen the first

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.240 
glucose is low so glycogen the first
step<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:38.960> cleave<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.800> glucose

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
step is going to cleave the glucose

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.270 
step is going to cleave the glucose
molecules<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.200> cleavage<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.950> gonna<00:01:43.130> be

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
molecules and this cleavage is gonna be

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.730 
molecules and this cleavage is gonna be
via<00:01:43.490> possible<00:01:44.090> releases<00:01:44.620> instead<00:01:45.620> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
via possible releases instead of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.280 
via possible releases instead of
hydrolysis<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:47.420> product<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.080> first

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
hydrolysis the product of the first

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.740 
hydrolysis the product of the first
reaction<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.950> glucose<00:01:49.370> 1-phosphate<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:50.630> we're

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
reaction is glucose 1-phosphate so we're

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.610 
reaction is glucose 1-phosphate so we're
putting<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.080> phosphate<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.400> c1<00:01:53.440> carbon<00:01:54.440> of

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
putting a phosphate on the c1 carbon of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.820 
putting a phosphate on the c1 carbon of
the<00:01:55.340> glucose<00:01:56.000> molecule<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.320> catalyzed

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
the glucose molecule this is catalyzed

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.070 
the glucose molecule this is catalyzed
from<00:01:58.160> glycogen<00:01:58.460> phosphorylase<00:01:59.030> which<00:01:59.900> is

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
from glycogen phosphorylase which is

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.490 
from glycogen phosphorylase which is
going<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.410> be<00:02:00.530> under<00:02:01.130> metabolic<00:02:01.700> control

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
going to be under metabolic control

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.870 
going to be under metabolic control
again<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:03.680> not<00:02:03.800> using<00:02:03.980> ATP

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
again we're not using ATP

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.450 
again we're not using ATP
to<00:02:05.500> phosphorylate<00:02:06.500> we're<00:02:06.860> using<00:02:07.100> an

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
to phosphorylate we're using an

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.850 
to phosphorylate we're using an
inorganic<00:02:07.850> phosphate<00:02:08.540> ion<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.230> in<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
inorganic phosphate ion that is in the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.880 
inorganic phosphate ion that is in the
cell<00:02:13.210> in<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.270> second<00:02:14.750> reaction<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.650> going

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
cell in the second reaction we are going

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.850 
cell in the second reaction we are going
to<00:02:16.010> be<00:02:16.100> moving<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.670> phosphate<00:02:17.120> from<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.080> c1

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
to be moving that phosphate from the c1

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.080 
to be moving that phosphate from the c1
to<00:02:19.220> c6

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
to c6

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.370 
to c6
so<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.170> an<00:02:21.350> isomerization<00:02:21.940> reaction<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.750> we

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
so it's an isomerization reaction and we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.590 
so it's an isomerization reaction and we
get<00:02:24.530> glucose<00:02:24.950> 6-phosphate<00:02:25.430> which<00:02:26.030> should

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
get glucose 6-phosphate which should

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.030 
get glucose 6-phosphate which should
look<00:02:26.780> familiar<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.800> you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
look familiar to you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.220 
look familiar to you
glucose<00:02:28.910> 6-phosphate<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.750> going<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.080> be<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
glucose 6-phosphate is going to be the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.190 
glucose 6-phosphate is going to be the
first<00:02:30.380> reaction<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.330> glycolysis<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:33.080> it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
first reaction of glycolysis and it's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.410 
first reaction of glycolysis and it's
basically<00:02:33.620> whenever<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.430> glucose<00:02:35.239> enters

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
basically whenever the glucose enters

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.560 
basically whenever the glucose enters
the<00:02:35.750> cell<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.320> puts<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.650> ball<00:02:36.800> chain<00:02:37.330> known<00:02:38.330> as

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the cell it puts the ball chain known as

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.530 
the cell it puts the ball chain known as
a<00:02:38.600> phosphate<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.320> c6<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.910> now<00:02:41.150> we're

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
a phosphate on c6 and so now we're

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.050 
a phosphate on c6 and so now we're
skipping<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.980> first<00:02:43.370> reaction<00:02:43.940> of

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.600 
glycolysis which remember cost us an ATP
molecule<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:49.820> for<00:02:50.330> glycolysis<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:51.610> the

fours when we get within four molecules
of<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.550> then<00:03:56.330> we're<00:03:56.600> going<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.870> use<00:03:57.080> what<00:03:57.350> is

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
of it then we're going to use what is

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.750 
of it then we're going to use what is
called<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.770> glycogen<00:03:58.550> debranching<00:03:59.030> enzyme

called a glycogen debranching enzyme
it's<00:04:01.760> actually<00:04:02.060> gonna<00:04:02.240> be<00:04:02.420> two<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.690> them<00:04:03.080> that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
it's actually gonna be two of them that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.380 
it's actually gonna be two of them that
are<00:04:03.830> going<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.190> take<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.580> branch<00:04:04.819> away<00:04:05.000> and

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
are going to take the branch away and

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.210 
are going to take the branch away and
then<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.960> second<00:04:06.350> one<00:04:06.470> will<00:04:06.620> come<00:04:06.800> in<00:04:06.950> and

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
then and the second one will come in and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.440 
then and the second one will come in and
take<00:04:08.500> hydrolyze<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:10.130> alpha<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:10.790> six<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
take hydrolyze this alpha one six and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.690 
take hydrolyze this alpha one six and
get<00:04:11.600> rid<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.780> it

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.599

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
branched molecule and it's on alpha 4

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.130

linkage<00:04:24.500> of<00:04:24.800> glucose<00:04:25.520> monomers<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.450> then<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
linkage of glucose monomers and then the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.370 
linkage of glucose monomers and then the
branch<00:04:27.500> points<00:04:28.100> are<00:04:28.220> alpha<00:04:28.610> 6<00:04:28.940> linkages<00:04:29.600> again

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
branch points are alpha 6 linkages again

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.250 
branch points are alpha 6 linkages again
still<00:04:30.830> glucose<00:04:31.250> monomers<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.630> what<00:04:32.840> we<00:04:32.990> need

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
still glucose monomers so what we need

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.230 
still glucose monomers so what we need
is<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:35.890> glycogen<00:04:36.890> phosphorylase<00:04:37.220> can<00:04:38.090> only

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
is the glycogen phosphorylase can only

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.590 
is the glycogen phosphorylase can only
get<00:04:38.570> with<00:04:38.750> them<00:04:38.900> for<00:04:39.730> monomers<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:41.240> branch

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
get with them for monomers of a branch

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.050 
get with them for monomers of a branch
point<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.800> what<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.070> need<00:04:43.250> is<00:04:43.280> debranching

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
point so what we need is debranching

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.210 
point so what we need is debranching
enzyme<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:44.840> which<00:04:44.930> will<00:04:45.110> come<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.800> they're

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
enzyme so which will come in and they're

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.520 
enzyme so which will come in and they're
gonna<00:04:46.310> remove<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.150> 4<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:48.260> they<00:04:48.350> have

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
gonna remove the 4 and then they have

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.100 
gonna remove the 4 and then they have
another<00:04:48.830> one<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.040> will<00:04:49.400> remove<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.910> actual

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
another one that will remove the actual

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.510 
another one that will remove the actual
alpha<00:04:51.110> 6<00:04:51.440> linkage<00:04:52.160> by<00:04:52.419> hydrolysis
