after the cup final in 89 unfortunately

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.910 
after the cup final in 89 unfortunately

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
all the time you have to hide them away

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200 
all the time you have to hide them away
so<00:01:54.569> he<00:01:54.630> doesn't<00:01:54.780> kick<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.859> my<00:01:56.009> baby<00:01:56.280> do

so he doesn't kick them but my baby do
you<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:58.170> need<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.770> next<00:01:59.069> season<00:01:59.399> what

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
you think we need for next season what

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.110 
you think we need for next season what
this<00:01:59.819> most<00:02:00.210> urgent

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
this most urgent

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.880 
this most urgent
you<00:02:01.210> see<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:02.200> know<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.440> would<00:02:02.530> be<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.620> test

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
you see it you know it would be a test

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.500 
you see it you know it would be a test
in<00:02:03.010> season<00:02:03.310> next<00:02:03.460> season<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.000> know<00:02:04.090> with<00:02:04.480> a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
in season next season you know with a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.150 
in season next season you know with a
Steven<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.560> think<00:02:05.620> there's<00:02:05.920> going<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.130> be

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
Steven going I think there's going to be

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.470 
Steven going I think there's going to be
probably<00:02:06.430> three<00:02:06.610> or<00:02:06.640> four<00:02:06.730> other<00:02:07.150> players

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
probably three or four other players

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.780 
probably three or four other players
that<00:02:07.600> are<00:02:07.830> making<00:02:08.830> mate<00:02:09.130> weights<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.580> side

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
that are making mate weights in the side

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.610 
that are making mate weights in the side
that<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.390> need<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.750> going<00:02:10.990> they<00:02:11.380> seem<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that that need to be going they seem to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.710 
that that need to be going they seem to
be<00:02:11.770> stripping<00:02:12.220> back<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> air<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
be stripping back on the air and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480 
be stripping back on the air and
lowering<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.140> weight<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.010> very<00:02:15.280> very

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
lowering the weight but it's very very

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.860 
lowering the weight but it's very very
important<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:15.940> get<00:02:16.090> marquee<00:02:16.510> signings

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
important that we get marquee signings

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.840 
important that we get marquee signings
coming<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> little<00:02:18.220> no<00:02:18.370> weird<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.670> that's<00:02:18.790> a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
coming in little no weird and that's a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.190 
coming in little no weird and that's a
great<00:02:19.000> sign<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.330> for<00:02:19.480> us<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.750> think<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.050> really

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
great sign in for us I think it really

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.180 
great sign in for us I think it really
is<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.770> play<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:20.950> many

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
is because you can play so many

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 
is because you can play so many
positions<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:21.850> think<00:02:21.940> that's<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.330> real<00:02:23.170> good

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
positions so I think that's a real good

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040 
positions so I think that's a real good
signing<00:02:23.740> he's<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.910> contact<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.900> makes

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
signing he's out of contact and it makes

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.140 
signing he's out of contact and it makes
it<00:02:26.140> even<00:02:26.290> even<00:02:26.920> better<00:02:27.100> for<00:02:27.370> us<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.090> think

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it even even better for us but I think

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.490 
it even even better for us but I think
it's<00:02:28.480> important<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.080> know<00:02:29.170> maybe

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
it's important that you know maybe

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
it's important that you know maybe
you'll<00:02:29.890> get<00:02:30.010> another<00:02:30.100> centre-half<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.270> need

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
you'll get another centre-half you need

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.870 
you'll get another centre-half you need
to<00:02:31.690> go<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> real<00:02:32.950> good<00:02:32.980> goal<00:02:33.430> scorer<00:02:33.760> as

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
to go and get a real good goal scorer as

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.850 
to go and get a real good goal scorer as
well<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.140> denim<00:02:35.410> storages

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
well because if you know denim storages

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.280 
well because if you know denim storages
is<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.430> out<00:02:36.610> injured<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.780> he<00:02:37.810> has<00:02:37.990> been<00:02:38.140> from

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
is is out injured as he has been from

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.950 
is is out injured as he has been from
most<00:02:38.590> part<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.790> season<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:40.690> he<00:02:40.780> needs

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
most part of this season then he needs

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.300 
most part of this season then he needs
someone<00:02:41.200> else<00:02:41.380> take<00:02:41.590> over<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.920> mental<00:02:42.250> and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
someone else take over the mental and

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.830 
someone else take over the mental and
you<00:02:42.400> can't<00:02:42.610> rely<00:02:42.790> on<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.420> answers<00:02:43.720> all

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
you can't rely on all the answers all

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.630 
you can't rely on all the answers all
the<00:02:43.870> time<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.220> important<00:02:45.550> that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the time so I think it's important that

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.700 
the time so I think it's important that
we<00:02:45.670> maybe<00:02:45.910> get<00:02:46.600> another<00:02:46.660> centre-half<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
we maybe get another centre-half and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.530 
we maybe get another centre-half and
certainly<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.220> certainly<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.970> striker<00:02:49.210> and<00:02:49.360> if

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
certainly a certainly a striker and if

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.480 
certainly a certainly a striker and if
we<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:51.160> believe

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
we get that and then I really believe

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.120 
we get that and then I really believe
that<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:51.850> do<00:02:52.120> something<00:02:52.360> I<00:02:53.260> would<00:02:53.950> imagine

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that we can do something I would imagine

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.310 
that we can do something I would imagine
that<00:02:54.310> mm-hm<00:02:54.850> we're<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.270> midfield<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:56.020> see

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
that mm-hm we're going to midfield I see

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.800 
that mm-hm we're going to midfield I see
him<00:02:56.440> more<00:02:56.620> as<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:57.550> midfield<00:02:58.360> player<00:02:58.570> than<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
him more as a a midfield player than I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.900 
him more as a a midfield player than I
do<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.230> centre-half<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.280> don't<00:03:00.550> think<00:03:00.760> he's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
do a centre-half I don't think he's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.970 
do a centre-half I don't think he's
could<00:03:01.750> help<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.020> be<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> centre-half<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.860> know

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
could help to be a centre-half you know

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.080 
could help to be a centre-half you know
putting<00:03:03.190> his<00:03:03.340> head<00:03:03.460> on<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.700> line<00:03:03.850> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
putting his head on the line and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.820 
putting his head on the line and
blocking<00:03:04.870> things<00:03:05.020> but<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.230> see<00:03:05.380> him<00:03:05.470> as<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.590> real

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
blocking things but I see him as a real

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.090 
blocking things but I see him as a real
real<00:03:06.070> good<00:03:06.250> player<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.489> do<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:07.989> like<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
real good player I do so I think like I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.680 
real good player I do so I think like I
said<00:03:09.310> send<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.610> forward<00:03:09.940> send<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> half<00:03:10.390> and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
said send a forward send a half and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.380
