in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> lenticular<00:01:05.730> piece<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.510> when

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in the lenticular piece here that when

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
in the lenticular piece here that when
it<00:01:07.170> changes<00:01:07.620> color<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.370> mean<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> gets<00:01:09.480> hot

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it changes color I mean when it gets hot

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560

and<00:01:09.900> cold<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.410> adds<00:01:10.680> flames<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.550> there<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and cold it adds flames on there so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
and cold it adds flames on there so
right<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.230> tell<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.560> cold<00:01:13.950> here
