00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.900 
proper way to plant is to go ahead and
dig<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> furrow<00:00:10.620> as<00:00:11.900> Connie's<00:00:12.900> done<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
dig a furrow as Connie's done here and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.420 
dig a furrow as Connie's done here and
then<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.089> take<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.800> fertilize<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> furrow

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
then you take and fertilize that furrow

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.620 
then you take and fertilize that furrow
and<00:00:18.199> mix<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.410> dirt<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.949> top<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.730> and

and mix in the dirt on top of it and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
and mix in the dirt on top of it and
then<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:21.900> gonna<00:00:22.020> plant<00:00:22.380> your<00:00:22.619> seed<00:00:26.480> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
then you're gonna plant your seed in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.440 
then you're gonna plant your seed in
this<00:00:27.630> case<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.170> okra<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.830> using

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
this case it's okra and we're using

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
this case it's okra and we're using
six-six-six<00:00:33.450> fertilizer<00:00:34.399> which<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
six-six-six fertilizer which is a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.630 
six-six-six fertilizer which is a
balanced<00:00:36.270> fertilizer<00:00:37.190> when<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
balanced fertilizer when you get up to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
balanced fertilizer when you get up to
15<00:00:39.540> 0<00:00:39.960> 15<00:00:40.940> that's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.210> potash<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.170> an

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
15 0 15 that's a potash and that's an

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
15 0 15 that's a potash and that's an
old<00:00:43.500> growers<00:00:43.980> trick<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:48.600> pour<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
old growers trick that you pour the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.700 
old growers trick that you pour the
water<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.250> plant<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.300> 15<00:00:51.809> 0<00:00:52.140> 15

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
water to the plant and that 15 0 15

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
water to the plant and that 15 0 15
fertilizer<00:00:53.340> will<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:56.750> fruit<00:00:57.750> swell<00:00:58.530> up

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
fertilizer will make the fruit swell up

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.950 
fertilizer will make the fruit swell up
with<00:00:58.949> water<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.059> tasteless<00:01:00.629> fruit

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with water so you get tasteless fruit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.950 
with water so you get tasteless fruit
but<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> weighs<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.250> sells<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.030> get

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
but it weighs a lot and it sells you get

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310 
but it weighs a lot and it sells you get
the<00:01:04.080> maximum<00:01:04.619> profit<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> want

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the maximum profit for it so if you want

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
the maximum profit for it so if you want
good<00:01:08.040> tasting<00:01:08.520> vegetables<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
good tasting vegetables you want to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.710 
good tasting vegetables you want to
either<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.460> an<00:01:11.610> organic<00:01:12.150> chicken

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
either if if you go an organic chicken

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
either if if you go an organic chicken
manure<00:01:12.900> cow<00:01:13.439> manure<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.100> goes<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> hole

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
manure cow manure it goes in the hole

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.260 
manure cow manure it goes in the hole
and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.229> seeds<00:01:16.640> chicken<00:01:17.640> manure<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then your seeds chicken manure is a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350 
and then your seeds chicken manure is a
very<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.170> powerful<00:01:19.860> powerful<00:01:20.360> fertilizer

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
very very powerful powerful fertilizer

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.399 
very very powerful powerful fertilizer
natural<00:01:21.990> fertilizer<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> row<00:01:24.180> of

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
natural fertilizer now this is a row of

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
natural fertilizer now this is a row of
beans<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.100> we've<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.340> her<00:01:26.700> already<00:01:27.689> put

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
beans going in we've got her already put

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.530 
beans going in we've got her already put
our<00:01:28.020> fertilizer<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> furrow<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.319 

now<00:01:33.540> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> gonna<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.939> put<00:01:35.939> some<00:01:36.180> dirt

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now kind of gonna take and put some dirt

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.260 
now kind of gonna take and put some dirt
over<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> reason<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> is

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
over that and the reason we do that is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
over that and the reason we do that is
to<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> fertilizer<00:01:41.250> won't<00:01:41.490> burn<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to so the fertilizer won't burn the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
to so the fertilizer won't burn the
roots<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.829> plant<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.790> grows<00:01:45.170> it'll

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
roots of the plant as it grows it'll

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
roots of the plant as it grows it'll
grow<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> fertilizer<00:01:48.020> hopefully<00:01:49.020> by

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
grow into the fertilizer hopefully by

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950 
grow into the fertilizer hopefully by
the<00:01:49.290> time<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.920> already<00:01:50.340> been<00:01:51.180> dissipated

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the time that's already been dissipated

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.770 
the time that's already been dissipated
in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> soil

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.980 

generally<00:02:02.530> put<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> couple<00:02:03.700> or<00:02:03.760> three<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:07.600> heel

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
generally put a couple or three for heel

generally put a couple or three for heel
I<00:02:09.869> purposefully<00:02:10.869> planted<00:02:13.080> some<00:02:14.080> peppers<00:02:15.390> with

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
I purposefully planted some peppers with

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.280 
I purposefully planted some peppers with
fertilizer<00:02:16.930> under<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:18.540> we've<00:02:19.540> shown<00:02:19.810> here

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
fertilizer under it as we've shown here

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.550 
fertilizer under it as we've shown here
and<00:02:20.440> some<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.580> are<00:02:21.790> side<00:02:22.090> dressed<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and some that are side dressed see the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.490 
and some that are side dressed see the
difference<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:25.450> height<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.450> proper<00:02:28.780> way<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
difference in height the proper way a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.950 
difference in height the proper way a
lot<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.950> people<00:02:30.220> will<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.610> take<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.240> they'll

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
lot of people will just take and they'll

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.260 
lot of people will just take and they'll
plant<00:02:32.350> their<00:02:32.620> seeds<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.800> furrow

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
plant their seeds and in in the furrow

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.060 
plant their seeds and in in the furrow
with<00:02:37.270> no<00:02:37.510> fertilizer<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:38.560> they'll<00:02:38.770> side

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
with no fertilizer and then they'll side

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.360 
with no fertilizer and then they'll side
dress<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.230> difference<00:02:41.710> right

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
dress it that's the difference right

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.610 
dress it that's the difference right
there<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.750> always<00:02:46.960> want<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> put<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
there so you always want to put the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.420 
there so you always want to put the
fertilizer<00:02:48.210> under<00:02:49.210> your<00:02:49.390> plants<00:02:50.190> we've<00:02:51.190> got

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
fertilizer under your plants we've got

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610 
fertilizer under your plants we've got
our<00:02:51.640> seeds<00:02:51.940> planted<00:02:52.450> let's<00:02:53.050> look<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
our seeds planted let's look at the
