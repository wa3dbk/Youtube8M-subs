00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
USB MIDI controller so you wouldn't need

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.539 
USB MIDI controller so you wouldn't need
any<00:00:09.300> Wi-Fi<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:11.300> all<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.570> need<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.549> three

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
connection kit which I got for five

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.170 
connection kit which I got for five
dollars<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.890> mean<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.160> could<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.060> at

Amazon anywhere and the prices vary but
this<00:00:28.920> one<00:00:29.160> works<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.210> has<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> lot<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this one works and it has a lot of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.110 
this one works and it has a lot of
inputs<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.000> it<00:00:33.000> works<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:35.120> launch

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
inputs and it works with like the launch

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750 
inputs and it works with like the launch
key<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:37.230> plug<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.890> iPad<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.370> use

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
key I can plug it into my iPad and use

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
key I can plug it into my iPad and use
it<00:00:38.969> um<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.750> here<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.290> Loomer<00:00:43.800> app<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it um so here I have the Loomer app and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.590 
it um so here I have the Loomer app and
I'm<00:00:44.760> using<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> control<00:00:45.750> Ableton<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.600> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
I'm using it to control Ableton and it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740 
I'm using it to control Ableton and it's
really<00:00:48.840> great<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> setup<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
really great for that and the setup is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
really great for that and the setup is
really<00:00:51.870> easy<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.350> said<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.579> set<00:00:53.760> up

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really easy you said you would set up

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
really easy you said you would set up
the<00:00:54.000> app<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> Wi-Fi

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the app just like you would with a Wi-Fi

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
the app just like you would with a Wi-Fi
so<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.250> settings<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so you go to to the settings and as you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.189 
so you go to to the settings and as you
can<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.430> says<00:01:02.719> Williams<00:01:03.719> iPad

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
can see here it just says Williams iPad

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.600 
can see here it just says Williams iPad
port<00:01:04.920> 1<00:01:05.159> port<00:01:05.670> 2<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.720> correspond<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
port 1 port 2 which correspond to to the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.340 
port 1 port 2 which correspond to to the
USB<00:01:09.090> MIDI<00:01:10.580> cable<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.850> that's<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.960> cable

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
USB MIDI cable so that's that that cable

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
USB MIDI cable so that's that that cable
essentially<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> essentially<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.180> an

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
essentially is essentially just an

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.760 
essentially is essentially just an
adapter<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.590> converting<00:01:17.159> MIDI<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.850> USB<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
adapter it's converting MIDI to USB and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
adapter it's converting MIDI to USB and
it's<00:01:19.770> connected<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> iPad<00:01:20.939> through<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
it's connected to the iPad through the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's connected to the iPad through the
iPad<00:01:21.810> connection<00:01:22.409> kit<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.150> then<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.330> going

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
iPad connection kit and then it's going

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
iPad connection kit and then it's going
to<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:25.080> audio<00:01:25.470> interface<00:01:25.619> which<00:01:26.250> takes<00:01:26.580> MIDI

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to my audio interface which takes MIDI

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.100 
to my audio interface which takes MIDI
and<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.200> mean<00:01:28.409> most<00:01:28.790> audio<00:01:29.790> interfaces<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.840> take

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and I mean most audio interfaces do take

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.850 
and I mean most audio interfaces do take
MIDI<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.869> simple<00:01:34.079> setup<00:01:34.500> that's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
MIDI and it's really simple setup that's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.109 
MIDI and it's really simple setup that's
all<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> need<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:38.520> works<00:01:38.790> great

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
all you need to do and it works great

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
all you need to do and it works great
and<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:40.829> costs<00:01:41.340> less<00:01:41.549> than<00:01:41.610> $20<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.960> I'll<00:01:43.890> show

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and it costs less than $20 and I'll show

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.569 
and it costs less than $20 and I'll show
you<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> quick<00:01:44.520> example<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:47.119> using<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
you a quick example of using it with a

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.010 
you a quick example of using it with a
song<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> I've<00:01:50.939> been<00:01:50.970> working<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
song that I've been working on so as you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.749 
song that I've been working on so as you
can<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.280> name<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
can see here you can see the name of the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
can see here you can see the name of the
clips<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.479> their<00:01:55.439> colors<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> also

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
clips and their colors and you can also

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
clips and their colors and you can also
control<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> faders<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
control you have the faders so you can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
control you have the faders so you can
control<00:02:00.329> each<00:02:00.689> channels<00:02:02.060> volume<00:02:03.110> which<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
control each channels volume which is

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.819 
control each channels volume which is
great<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:07.140> control<00:02:07.560> their

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
great and you can also control their

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.920 
great and you can also control their
effects<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.399> them

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
effects on them

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:34.000 
effects on them
and
