00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.990 

that<00:02:06.620> so<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:07.490> four<00:02:09.490> so<00:02:10.490> we<00:02:10.610> should<00:02:10.850> only

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
that so that's four so we should only

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.330 
that so that's four so we should only
have<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.690> do<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.320> more<00:02:12.350> exit<00:02:13.010> without<00:02:13.100> saving

again<00:02:23.440> I'm<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.860> should<00:02:25.250> really<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.910> in

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
again I'm you should really do this in

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.710 
again I'm you should really do this in
one<00:02:27.110> sitting<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:29.060> you're<00:02:29.240> doing<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:29.660> way

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
one sitting if you're doing it this way

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.130 
one sitting if you're doing it this way
because<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.910> think<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.450> only<00:02:32.630> saved<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
because I think it's only saved in the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690 
because I think it's only saved in the
temporary<00:02:33.620> memory<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.220> not<00:02:34.400> sure<00:02:34.520> if<00:02:34.610> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
temporary memory I'm not sure if it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.370 
temporary memory I'm not sure if it
actually<00:02:34.850> saves<00:02:35.240> on<00:02:35.360> your<00:02:35.480> profile<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.320> you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
actually saves on your profile if you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:47.000 
actually saves on your profile if you
keep<00:02:36.650> exiting<00:02:37.040> without<00:02:37.310> saving<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.820> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.730 

and<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:51.870> we've<00:02:52.870> agreed<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.260> don't<00:02:53.440> need<00:02:53.590> it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
and here we've agreed you don't need it

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.870 
and here we've agreed you don't need it
for<00:02:53.920> bones<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.740> gonna<00:02:56.830> wait<00:02:57.100> here<00:02:57.160> this
