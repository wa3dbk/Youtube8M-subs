actually last year I got drafted to the
Blues<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.540> eight<00:01:06.780> overall<00:01:07.290> or

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
Blues I think about eight overall or

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.140 
Blues I think about eight overall or
something<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.549> send<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.000> few

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
something like that because I send a few

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.929 
something like that because I send a few
games<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> familiar<00:01:10.740> territory<00:01:11.280> for

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
games so this is familiar territory for

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
sliders and things across so it will

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.539 
sliders and things across so it will
make<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> difficult<00:01:44.930> okay<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.649> restricted

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
make it difficult okay so a restricted

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940
