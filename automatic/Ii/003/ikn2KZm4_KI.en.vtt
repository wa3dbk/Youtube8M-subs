00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
a bit with another pen

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.960 
a bit with another pen
that<00:05:33.640> I<00:05:33.670> also<00:05:33.940> picked<00:05:34.330> up<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:36.130> also<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:37.090> 1<00:05:37.780> 4<00:05:38.020> 6<00:05:38.970> it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
that I also picked up is also a 1 4 6 it

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
that I also picked up is also a 1 4 6 it

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.659 

as<00:06:17.419> you<00:06:17.600> can<00:06:17.750> see<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.199> ink<00:06:18.410> in<00:06:19.009> this<00:06:19.310> one<00:06:19.520> is<00:06:19.639> a

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
as you can see the ink in this one is a

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.150 
as you can see the ink in this one is a
modest<00:06:20.060> the<00:06:20.150> mumblin<00:06:20.509> black<00:06:20.720> ink<00:06:20.990> and<00:06:21.259> it

modest the mumblin black ink and it

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.390 
modest the mumblin black ink and it
writes<00:06:22.430> far<00:06:23.150> better<00:06:23.389> than<00:06:23.919> the<00:06:24.919> Montegrappa

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
writes far better than the Montegrappa

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.090 
writes far better than the Montegrappa
black<00:06:27.190> it<00:06:28.190> has<00:06:28.400> gold<00:06:29.030> highlights<00:06:29.650> and<00:06:30.650> so

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
black it has gold highlights and so

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.860 
black it has gold highlights and so
fairly<00:06:31.370> heavy<00:06:31.669> pen<00:06:31.970> considering<00:06:32.600> it's

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
fairly heavy pen considering it's

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.830 
fairly heavy pen considering it's
completely<00:06:33.560> out<00:06:33.680> of<00:06:33.710> sterling<00:06:34.039> silver<00:06:34.690> it<00:06:35.690> is
