00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:02.340
 in the afternoon 2pm 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.100
 It is interesting even though it is true that the exhibition portrays the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.310
 importance of lies in society but to better explain this matter 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.329
 I talk to the plastic artist Adriana 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.249
 adriane what story is this you are defending the lie in his works on 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.400
 truth does not advocate elements of the liar boy 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.610
 and just recounted some lies that we usually listen to 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.400
 days some lies they protest in eliza and take the human being 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.970
 they help the other to move forward 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.250
 these lies they hurt not only in lies the selfish and to think 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.340
 only in itself 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.570
 and sometimes harm the next to an entire society 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.979
 and you seek inspiration from the money 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.420
 in the tropicÃ¡lia are therefore blame which in the background has built a critical 

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:52.049
 but exactly 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.120
 tropicÃ¡lia is something that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.979
 ef 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.859
 I find you interesting 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 the chaos make a work of art that makes the person think 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.960
 and change of attitude 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.210
 in my exposition that I want 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.090
 I seek my viewer is that he does not condemn all liars and 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.560
 also decide if you are going to be a good man took the zon malmente lusa 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.899
 I tried everybody's mind 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.090
 sometimes they can head right away because of education you are forced to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.279
 tell a lie or commit a truth the omission of truth also a way 

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:28.090
 of 20 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.900
 eva asks our camera pro shows that some soft works and rodrigo 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.659
 I'll highlight 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.570
 the lie that protects 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.250
 because this title I want you to explain a little better about this work 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.580
 the lie that protests 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.990
 we get hard even caught 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.580
 an actual fact of a mother who was raped denying the essence 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.800
 and did not abort on tv if the child and she mind 90 was with that girl she never 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.050
 told the truth to her whether it is the result of an act of violence 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.800
 then it is this necessary lie because 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.620
 is that I do not believe a child is going to get it to grow 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.840
 in no way monthly of the very legal disease is the result of an act of violence 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.279
 at the moment the mother suffered so much and that the father is a monster 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.339
 this is a necessary lie 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.039
 finally is beautiful 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.750
 because the mother was kept secret to her 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.789
 child's interpol 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.519
 Do you work with the ass? 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.839
 How's it going? 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.009
 because it is a transparent product stage that more about this project 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.839
 what if winning the series has a purity is like a crystal video 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:38.769
 but it looks like acrylic the difference from it with acrylic is that 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.599
 practically no scratch 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.319
 and it is not flammable 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.379
 ap actually only goes without fame from the part of the 400 degrees 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.219
 I saw the wall stare at the Jamaican Sollers this unintentionally because to me the 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.329
 lies they also interact for our lives, and every day we go 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.459
 listening to a lie that I talal told to a 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.809
 and often not 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.809
 he knows that the other also fears for education. 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.779
 then this transparency also has to do with that shaken date mitigates that 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.149
 interacts with people's lives 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:14.119
 ah the first of the light depending on the wall that shadow in the position change 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.159
 only to pass by the viewers that first work 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.629
 it's a lie that protects it was 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.049
 agripino explained 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.159
 I want to highlight but it's something like that 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.010
 none of the works session 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.530
 abstract all of them are figurative here and I will give a hint is to walk 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.990
 it is expected that the 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.979
 a brake 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.979
 mother's hair the shoulders 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.810
 the child in the center 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.810
 She is hugging her daughter. 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.439
 Do not have your good lies here in my situation. 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.759
 lies harmed 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.619
 and other types of lies but then people have to come here in the sesc 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.870
 504 south to take a look skewer 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.330
 I'm sure a lot of people will identify with some kind of liar. 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.049
 on here 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.569
