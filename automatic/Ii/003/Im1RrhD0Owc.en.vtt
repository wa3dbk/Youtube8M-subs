00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.100
 The stars sleep on the roofs. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
 Children sleep in cribs. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.100
 Murlyka red cat went to the eaves. 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.100
 He has white gloves on his paws, he has a white “kitty, kitty” around his neck. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 Instead of a microphone, the tail takes the purring. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 The song is not new, but its own. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 Kis-kis-meow - that's all the music, Kis-kis-meow - that's all the words! 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 Flashing windows, and screaming rush - 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 Do not interfere, it's time for people to sleep! 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 Stop this music-music! 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 What is this competition in the middle of the yard? 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 Instead of a microphone, the tail takes the purring. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 The song is not new, but its own. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 Kis-kis-meow - that's all the music, Kis-kis-meow - that's all the words! 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 But no one understood the poor artist, 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.300
 And he did not shout "bravo", and did not shout "bis"! 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.800
 And he left proudly, deafened by the whistle, 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.400
 And he carried a white “kitty, kitty” around his neck. 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.500
 Instead of a microphone, the tail takes the purring. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 The song is not new, but its own. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 Kis-kis-meow - that's all the music, Kis-kis-meow - that's all the words! 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 Instead of a microphone, the tail takes the purring 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 The song is not new, but its own. 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 Kis-kit-meow - that's all the music, Kis-kit-meow - that's all the words!
