00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.170 

I<00:00:23.539> start<00:00:24.590> three<00:00:25.590> years<00:00:25.830> ago<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.880> marine

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
I start three years ago in the marine

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.920 
I start three years ago in the marine
that<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:28.340> aquatic<00:00:29.340> part<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
that is a aquatic part I think is the

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.350 
that is a aquatic part I think is the
best<00:00:31.169> feeling<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.680> the<00:00:31.890> life<00:00:32.070> why<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> start<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
best feeling of the life why I start I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.740 
best feeling of the life why I start I
don't<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:34.020> why<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.650> all<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> us<00:00:35.760> used<00:00:36.629> to

don't know why really all of us used to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
don't know why really all of us used to
training<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
training really lot because it's a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.630 
training really lot because it's a
really<00:00:39.239> hard<00:00:39.540> part<00:00:40.170> sport<00:00:40.589> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> used<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
really hard part sport so I used to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.060 
really hard part sport so I used to
train<00:00:41.879> every<00:00:42.480> day<00:00:42.720> every<00:00:43.440> day<00:00:43.470> condition

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
train every day every day condition

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880 
train every day every day condition
every<00:00:44.610> day<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:45.180> used<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:45.540> die<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:45.960> 10<00:00:46.230> meters<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
every day I used to die from 10 meters I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
every day I used to die from 10 meters I
used<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.400> mind<00:00:47.640> optional<00:00:48.330> diet<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
used to be the mind optional diet and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.229 
used to be the mind optional diet and
then<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.010> Bharani<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:52.579> used<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> jump

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then a lot of Bharani and I used to jump

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
then a lot of Bharani and I used to jump
everyday<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> trampoline<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.699> easy

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
everyday on the trampoline it's not easy

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
everyday on the trampoline it's not easy
you<00:00:57.300> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.840> keep<00:00:58.289> fit<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.280> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you need to keep fit you need to be

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
you need to keep fit you need to be
strong<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.600> party<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> water<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
strong because they party the water is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.040 
strong because they party the water is
really<00:01:01.920> hard<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.840> need<00:01:04.020> to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
really hard so I think that you need to

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.889 
really hard so I think that you need to
be<00:01:04.320> ready<00:01:04.649> for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.690> every-everything

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
be ready for the every-everything

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.139 
be ready for the every-everything
training<00:01:07.289> this<00:01:07.410> kind<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.800> dive<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.940> not

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
training this kind of dive is it's not

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.529 
training this kind of dive is it's not
really<00:01:09.450> easy<00:01:09.509> cuz<00:01:09.930> oh<00:01:10.520> there<00:01:11.520> isn't<00:01:11.670> any<00:01:12.240> plot

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
really easy cuz oh there isn't any plot

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.529 
really easy cuz oh there isn't any plot
from<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> height<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.009> every<00:01:14.940> time<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.390> need<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
from the height so every time we need to

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.100 
from the height so every time we need to
break<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> dive<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.160> then<00:01:17.550> work<00:01:18.539> every

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
break the dive and then work every

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
break the dive and then work every
single<00:01:19.470> part<00:01:19.679> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.039> dive<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.119> start<00:01:21.570> from

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
single part of the dive so I start from

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.380 
single part of the dive so I start from
10<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.940> my<00:01:24.929> first<00:01:25.200> dive<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.890> pull<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
10 I do my my first dive like pull out a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
10 I do my my first dive like pull out a
few<00:01:27.630> times<00:01:27.869> sometimes<00:01:28.200> forget<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.950> feeling

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
few times sometimes forget the feeling

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.040 
few times sometimes forget the feeling
of<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.580> die<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.179> understand<00:01:30.690> for<00:01:30.959> the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
of the die for understand for the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.449 
of the die for understand for the
spotting<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.360> lot<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> Bharani<00:01:34.459> you

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
spotting and then a lot of Bharani you

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.339 
spotting and then a lot of Bharani you
are<00:01:35.550> in<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.880> position<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.080> head

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
are in this position so with the head

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.559 
are in this position so with the head

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
the first things that I think when I'm

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.560 
the first things that I think when I'm
funded<00:02:05.290> on<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.830> platform<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.700> Capeside

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
funded on that platform is a Capeside

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160 
funded on that platform is a Capeside
try<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.800> don't<00:02:09.009> hurt<00:02:09.160> yourself<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.170> yeah

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
try to don't hurt yourself and yeah

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.800 
try to don't hurt yourself and yeah
before<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.950> make<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.250> dive<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.690> be

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
before to make the dive I just got to be

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.699 
before to make the dive I just got to be
handled<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.380> platform<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.450> think<00:02:16.500> look<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
handled the platform and think look the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.900 
handled the platform and think look the
panorama<00:02:18.220> try<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> keep<00:02:19.480> calm<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.350> then<00:02:21.130> when

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
panorama try to keep calm and then when

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.809 
panorama try to keep calm and then when
I'm<00:02:22.060> ready<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.400> end<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
I'm ready I go to the end of the

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.300 
I'm ready I go to the end of the
platform<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.450> take<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> position<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.950> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
platform I take the position and then I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.220 
platform I take the position and then I
start<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.880> think<00:02:27.970> about<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.510> die<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.110> have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
start to think about the die what I have

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.680 
start to think about the die what I have
to<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.310> try<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> imagine<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.480> right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to do so I try to imagine the right

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.479 
to do so I try to imagine the right
position<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.680> my<00:02:32.800> my<00:02:33.459> head<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.200> then<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:36.190> try

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
position in my my head and then I I try

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.400 
position in my my head and then I I try
to<00:02:36.550> look<00:02:36.940> down<00:02:37.209> because<00:02:37.510> obviously<00:02:37.959> I'm

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
to look down because obviously I'm

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.250 
to look down because obviously I'm
scared<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.010> look<00:02:39.040> down<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:40.989> me<00:02:41.080> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
scared to look down because it for me is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.920 
scared to look down because it for me is
high<00:02:41.440> when<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.459> dead<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:43.150> think<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.630> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
high when I'm dead I just think that I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.060
