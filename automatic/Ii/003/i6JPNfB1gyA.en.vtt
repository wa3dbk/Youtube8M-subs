00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.970
 Below we present two studies with the same idea in common 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.379
 the dance of the horses by the cable 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.150
 in this first studio by the Latvian composer ernest gulbis ians white 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.449
 they play and they win 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.010
 if you want you can pause at this time to resolve the position 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.150
 let's see the solution 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.240
 although the plants have a piece of advantage it seems that the black pawn of h2 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.200
 crown sooner than that of a white must 7 still the best play of the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.060
 plants is to advance your pawn 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.480
 if Black captures the pawn, White would have material advantage 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.560
 decisive after bishop and 4 check and finally by cetrex 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.280
 On the other hand, if Black crowns the h2 pawn, the end shows the idea that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.860
 inspired his composition the white rock crowns a horse in 8 with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.670
 Street 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.100
 the location of the pieces on the board make the king's plays in 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.670
 January are forced and the only play of the black king is to go to the square of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.610
 five 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.880
 the end continues with the dance of the white horses cavallo c7 jake &amp; blake

 check king and h3 cavallo f4 check king of two cavallo g4 mate 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 after seeing the previous ending it is easy to deduce the reason for this composition 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.770
 in which White plays and wins 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.020
 you can again pause if you want to analyze the position 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.330
 let's see the solution 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.340
 Black's overwhelming material advantage forces White to crown his 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.260
 pawn in a useful piece but as in the previous end the black pieces only 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.320
 they serve to lock their king 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.610

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.650
 for this reason the measures can not play anything other than move the king 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.690
 already five 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.460
 and again the white horses force the black king to walk the cable
