putting<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.890> ring<00:02:43.070> with<00:02:43.280> him<00:02:43.370> give<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.120> an

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
putting a ring with him give you an

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.240 
putting a ring with him give you an
example<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.170> i<00:02:45.260> use<00:02:45.440> brandon<00:02:45.950> rios

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250

i<00:02:46.430> think<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.120> most<00:02:47.270> likely<00:02:47.860> let's<00:02:48.860> say

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
i think it's the most likely let's say

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.440 
i think it's the most likely let's say
rios<00:02:49.310> will<00:02:49.490> be<00:02:49.580> putting<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> ring<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.300> him

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
rios will be putting the ring with him

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
rios will be putting the ring with him
why<00:02:51.110> would<00:02:51.290> he<00:02:51.350> people<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.709> ring<00:02:51.890> with<00:02:52.010> him<00:02:52.070> so

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
why would he people a ring with him so

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100
