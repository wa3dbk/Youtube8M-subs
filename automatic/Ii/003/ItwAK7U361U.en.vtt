00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.700

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.250
 And then I'll start off with another video here 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.740
 on the channel and this time I'm here to 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 talk a little about this new news 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.830
 very new news even left yesterday 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.119
 Monday I 'm making a video 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.910
 according to the crowd 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.180
 but for me here is very new news 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 for it will not be so new but 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.900
 is the new is a playstation 2 washer 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.269
 for android goes into beta 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.030
 look, man, he's already running in 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.520
 with his panel difficulties made and 10 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.579
 It's a game here that I do not know much about. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.070
 well the grid the five do not know if I am 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.860
 speaking the right name but he's already 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 running and with your difficulties more days 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.649
 already running so old is the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.899
 developers are trying to 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.729
 it's hard to make it spin 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.240
 Calm down, there you are, then it's very old. 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.180
 fuck and in the end there's an expensive surprise 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 that they talk until it can roll 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.189
 shadow of the colossus then is the site 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.760
 This is what I do not know if the guys 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.990
 They said that but the site is talking 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.960
 That's what he says at the end is already 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.720
 already imagined being able to revive 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.140
 shadow of the colossus from a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.890
 mobile device lacks is too fucking 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 old 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.479
 so I'll read it a bit and for you 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.210
 You better understand the site is there in 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.240
 description for you guys want to see better 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.150
 there with your own eyes the video that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.549
 I'll put it in the background for you, it 's the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.820
 current stage of development of this 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.880
 pt that promises to run the games the beloved 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.329
 playstation 2 with you can see the game 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.240
 in question is final fantasy 10 that still 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.820
 wheel with a very low frame rate 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.710
 of the ideal that allows a 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.630
 fluid gameplay 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.650
 so what's this old gameplay 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.530
 also fought friend half barred there and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.430
 the graphics so good, huh? 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.849
 from what I saw there in the gameplay are 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.370
 pretty tall for a tablet is old 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.150
 So it's a good graphic photo and also the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.099
 video shows rotating grid the five do not 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.439
 I know if I'm speaking right but it's a 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.590
 of this kind and has a 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:38.769
 result a little better this game, right? 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.349
 because of being a little too more 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.870
 looking made lightweight and 10 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.560
 however the developers point out 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.569
 that clay is still in its infancy and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.970

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.040

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.810
 awareness that it will be a little 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.030
 trading and not even old 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.959
