hurry up type of an offense and we move

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.770 
hurry up type of an offense and we move
the<00:02:11.920> ball<00:02:12.070> down<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.459> field<00:02:12.640> we<00:02:13.180> did<00:02:13.390> come<00:02:13.570> up<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the ball down the field we did come up a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.270 
the ball down the field we did come up a
little<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:14.049> short<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.470> had<00:02:14.590> opportunities<00:02:14.709> in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
little bit short we had opportunities in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.310 
little bit short we had opportunities in
the<00:02:15.459> first<00:02:15.700> half<00:02:15.880> put<00:02:16.720> points<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> board

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
the first half put points on the board

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.940 
the first half put points on the board
and<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:18.040> kind<00:02:18.310> of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
and we kind of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.860 
and we kind of
let<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> slip<00:02:19.670> from<00:02:19.849> our<00:02:20.030> fingertips<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
let it slip from our fingertips and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.080 
let it slip from our fingertips and
probably<00:02:21.680> would<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:21.950> made<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.160> difference<00:02:22.610> in

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
probably would have made a difference in

probably would have made a difference in
the<00:02:23.180> ballgame<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.810> outcome<00:02:24.230> was<00:02:24.349> going
