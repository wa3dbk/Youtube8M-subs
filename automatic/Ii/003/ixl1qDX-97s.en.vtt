learn on a trampoline with it the whole
idea<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> learning<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> feelings

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
idea here is that learning the feelings

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.779 
idea here is that learning the feelings
of<00:00:27.060> grabs<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.869> spins<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.349> flips<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.920> easier
