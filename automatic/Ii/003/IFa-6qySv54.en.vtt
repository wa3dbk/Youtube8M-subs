 A very cool doctor, very nice to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.490
 who against women faster than 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.040
 Minecraft does not have the patience of me. 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.920
 release things like you can 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.379
 simply smell the ores 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.649
 for your world as it so strikes 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.960
 basically you gain the power to feel 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.690
 the fragrance of coal and all 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 ores that have greater craft 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.110
 simply by clicking the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.730
 right and teaches by activating its power and 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.920
 right-clicking for example 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.070
 they are seeing this smoke that is 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.579
 getting out of me when I push the button 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.620
 right she told me that the 18 blocks there 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.899
 on top I 'm climbing so it 's not 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.850
 increasing but there is now more 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.840
 next that there are five team blocks in 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.000
 coal 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.310
 Let's see if this is true that daruma 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 spreading a little more coal is 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 in this direction, we only find charcoal 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.610
 Come on, let's try to find a 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 another ore your grandfather 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.979
 I want to get a block of gold face look 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.750
 I'm feeling the block of 40 gold 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.959
 blocks down here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.340
 first I will need to attack a 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.170
 night vision position if not I do not 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.209
 I will be able to see anything added that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.789
 the right-wing opposition between me and the already 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.160
 smell the crowd there in 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.920
 neither appears nor appears at the distance 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.810
 block stadium you are in block and 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.090
 you simply just have to follow not 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 and you can you basically have a 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.729
 sensor that will always point to where 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.550
 is the ore, this sensor is 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.050
 activated when you hit or you click 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.899
 right-click anywhere in the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.039
 Your mouse will hit the sensor is 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.660
 activated right 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.399
 it is activated by pressing the option key 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.500
 We're almost here near the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.060
 gold for the fragrance feel galera o 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.580
 yesterday shot a block of gold 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.680
 here's a guy we're going to try 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.079
 to find the diamond was the diamond 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.269
 It is still very low even 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.580
 he is going in that direction and the legal is 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.890
 what kind each crowned mine 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 seriously he has his own body for 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.600
 example the diamond the fragrance of it is the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.520
 zone as if it were the very 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.800
 intuitive way that you should only follow this 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.170
 plague this business is that it creates cool 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 We found diamond too much more 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.850
 easy to find ores there and you can 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.760
 find all types from gold to 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.010
 iron to and everything else is let me out 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.720
 from within the earth why is it 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.610
 not a good place to stay 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.250
 so I saw people in a matter of seconds 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.780
 you find it simply 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.700
 right-clicking looks has a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.830
 diamond that the 63 box 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 let's get some distance and see if 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.850
 is nearest 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.430
 I think it's already changed now it has a kiosk 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.930
 cool he kind of points right 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.880
 for this to work guys is very 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.010
 simple you have to press the O key and 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.950
 you press the or button until 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.540
 it shows which ore you are 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.300
 For example, this one I'm in now. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.950
 blue and here I am in the net stone here not 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.450
 has no historic goal that does not 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.050
 I'm in it, right? But if it's in the name 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.110
 it will appear is 4 coal airon 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.030
 godoy and orson daemon basically if you 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.989
 you can deactivate the sensor by 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.150
 l key 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.280
 ready you deactivate your sensor you do not 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 find more minerals but tightening the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.739
 key again you activate it and go 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.390
 selecting the ore you want is 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.360
 basically this is a very 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.940
 cool and I think it's cool, you go 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.280
 feeling the fragrance o smell the smell 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.650
 of dystonia I felt the smell of return 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.630
 It's very tasty in MaceiÃ³. 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.470
 the car smell flipped near no 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.019
 it was just look at the smell of charcoal here 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.080
 enjoying that smell of ether but 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.360
 hot something like that album is very 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.680
 face much easier to find ores 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.360
