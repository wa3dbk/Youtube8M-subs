00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
decided to use number which is really

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
decided to use number which is really
clever<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> can't<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.289> just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
clever because then I can't really just

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
clever because then I can't really just
link<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.430> stones<00:00:23.699> together<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.449> go<00:00:24.630> for

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
kills free thinking I could probably get

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550 
kills free thinking I could probably get
a<00:00:26.340> kill<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> usually<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.570> usually<00:00:28.199> can't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

all<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> his<00:00:32.910> cool<00:00:33.090> down<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.420> you'll<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
all of his cool down so you'll have

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
all of his cool down so you'll have
nothing<00:00:34.140> left<00:00:34.350> defensively<00:00:34.980> whatsoever<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
nothing left defensively whatsoever and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.490 
nothing left defensively whatsoever and
then<00:00:35.910> touch<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.420> karma<00:00:36.750> ok<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> column<00:00:37.380> is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
then touch of karma ok so the column is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.970 
then touch of karma ok so the column is
gone<00:00:38.120> let's<00:00:39.120> say<00:00:39.239> 45<00:00:39.870> brew<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> gone<00:00:40.440> that
