have<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.710> goes<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.520> spot

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
have it to it just goes in that spot

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.440 
have it to it just goes in that spot
conversions<00:02:34.920> between<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.550> two<00:02:35.760> number
