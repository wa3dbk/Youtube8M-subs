 Tender flowers and wright hands to the work 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.140
 we will start by applying a base in color 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.260
 yellow remember that this base is created 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.149
 using a visit to a mixed base 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.010
 with pigments of the color you want in 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.010

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.129
 pink and I'm going to apply it on the eyelid

 mobile and corner I will go down to the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.289

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.159
 continuity and that you see an eye a 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.159

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.830

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.370
 false eyelashes to stick them on the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.569
 outer corner of the eyelashes 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.019
