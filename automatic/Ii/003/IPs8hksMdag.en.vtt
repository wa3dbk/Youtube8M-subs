00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
octaves and was very distorted so after

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
death of Mac as you would expect I was

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.370 
death of Mac as you would expect I was
very<00:01:04.860> shocked<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> thought<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.840> first<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
very shocked but I thought at first that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.550 
very shocked but I thought at first that
this<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.040> maybe<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.610> more<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> joke

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
this was maybe just a more of a joke

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.810 
this was maybe just a more of a joke
seeing<00:01:10.560> how<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.830> episode<00:01:11.280> looks<00:01:11.460> somewhat

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
unfinished so I finally got to see the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
unfinished so I finally got to see the
episode<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:16.130> starts<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.280> Mac<00:01:17.580> running
