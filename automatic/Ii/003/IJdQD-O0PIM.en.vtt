00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 and as for nothing, it's like he 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.290
 there are no networks for players and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.059
 we are not good at recruiting 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.530
 aliens the same way we're not going 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.849
 watch a coach abroad and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.080
 I 'll tell you it's even worse for 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 what is the coach because 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.960
 it's corporatism and it's the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 chauvinism that prevents us from going 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 look abroad because we think 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.320
 be better 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.000
 which makes them all the same 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 diploma that will all of that pass their 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.830
 small dpf with trainers whom i have 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 not even want to mention the name because 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 their past and their resume splash us 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
 the face and so they come back with 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 their little degree and are all doing little 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.440
 near the same thing on the ground of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.309
 trainers who were impressed by 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 the coach's speech was not courbis 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:46.350
 impressed roland so that's behind 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.850
 if I hope I go because there is a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 pink impressed when I'm going to take 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 the door 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.500
 what is behind this for 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.059
 conclude behind this corporatism 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.780
 can to leaders who for the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 most people are often 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 it is true that it lacks something that if 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.030
 we changed nothing and who do not know 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.630
 everything else that does not even know 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.400
 what tracks to flush out or not 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.360
 would it be to undertake then is it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.530
 that you think we're next to the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 plate completely or do you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
 shares some of our analyzes 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 saying it's not because I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 do not agree with you when you 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.479
 are next to the plate obligatorily 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.930
 but I can still give my point 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.330
 of view not to stupidly defend my 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 profession to try anyway 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.840
 to have another vision of things 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 I do not have the pleasure of knowing the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 dozen of best German coach nor the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 dozen of the best English coach nor 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 dozens of the best coaches on 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.509
 can only be too long but 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.409
 because school because if you want 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 you daniel who is the friendliest 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.880
 chameleon of all consultants Thursday 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.530
 do not even remember what he says and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.649
 which starts nine times out of ten these 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.329
 sentences in ten years javi well said that and 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.380
 from time to time I give you the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.380
 batwa programmer but if I am 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.250
 if I can speak I have a chance 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.590
 to prove it to you 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.709
 that is, you are still 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.630
 whoever has tried has come to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.099
 convince some of the people but you 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.000
 did not come to me yet comic but 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.519
 maybe you'll get there 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.420
 I tried to explain to ourselves that the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.420
 French footballers 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.060
 he was poorly trained the bond and the yang 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 damn but I can finish besides 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.330
 Besides, we are parents at 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.130
 abroad because they are poorly trained 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.720
 How well do you happened to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.819
 drink the shapes then with regards to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.290
 regards the coaches we are between 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.360
 we may be truffles 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.069
 but with regard to consultants 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.440
 it will take after you find yourself 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.560
 that is to say that you are located in the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.900
 guy who had the audacity and the nerve 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 wish our team from France and 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.940
 So our French footballers is 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.709
 not to brazil because the team of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 France who come from who comes 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.810
 today to qualify against 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.530
 Ukraine instead of discovering that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.000
 finally didier deschamps found the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 good formula of a good team 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.170
 balanced thing to find laurent 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.940
 White in Paris Saint Germain after 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.120
 ancelotti who had not found him 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.709
 I will never returned modestly done 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.359
 a lot to answer I answer 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.530
 still does not it's the kind of 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.069
 What are you doing ? 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.079
 even though I am not a polygamist 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.970
 what have you, you're Catrice which can 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.829
 vary but do you ever listen to me 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.630
 sloping up all all all all 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.180
 three months without playing that give me a 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.730
 small and modest list now if they 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.810
 are not French you tell me a 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.850
 vulgar it's good 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.790
 laurent white is good deschamps it's 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.180
 good guard garcia it's good keeps its 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.700
 bombs 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.319
 gourcuff it's good galtier girard 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.660
 casanova have not calmed down or 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.519
 truffles they know how to start like 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.769
 did a little bit their job and I 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.420
 to say something about me I have 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.700
 not used to having an ego 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.340
 oversized but at the level of my 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.049
 profession I think to be as good as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.150
 you at yours at least 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.130
 as well okay now I 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.099
 you're listening and it's a luxury 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.709
 for me that after we can tell each other 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.630
 that the club presidents are the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.940
 most important people of a club 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.610
 where we will agree but see by 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.359
 example 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.540
 fred antonetti five league clubs 1 that 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.090
 demonstrates that really coaches 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.420
 French he does not want to be bad at 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.100
 less not all bad I'm listening 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.900
 so so we'll start with 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.070
 French players and training even though 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.570
 it was not really the debate but I 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.180
 should take that argument 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.820
 so it's the players expose themselves the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.530
 France is the second largest exporter 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.330
 of players in europe but bad 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.710
 players the average is very bad the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.300
 most coaches abroad the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.980
 say and most of the consultants and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.750
 your colleagues also say it and even 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.360
 roof sometimes you concede it a little to off 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.460
 but hey I'll be granted it's I 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.870
 will grant this idea since you have 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.640
 want to think that in any case I 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.080
 finds that most of the results of the 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.610
 french european cup of our clubs 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.620
 French led by our coaches 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.060
 French are ridiculous every year in 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.400
 European Cup against clubs that have 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.010
 budgets ten times lower I think 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 that all the finding of our football 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.070
 show I'm right now you 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.390
 can continue as in 2008 to tell me 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.010
 that the France team is great 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.660
 that 30 best French players is 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.310
 better than 30 best German players 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 you can continue to say it's five 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.890
 years that you are wrong you can continue 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.770
 for the french team 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.210
 so I argued the argument that was 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.979
 the next one at that moment is that seen 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.419
 the panade in which we were 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.740
 said that if we did not go it was 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.430
 no worse than that could be an evil 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.810
 for a good 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.690
 actually because it could 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.020
 allow everything to resume now 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.320
 let's go 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.060
 and first of all finally being of dallas and 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.590
 fallen and I do not even want to say 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.860
 all I heard off because 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.540
 Well, well, it almost annoys me what 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.430
 to have been the only brave one in this 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.660
 case while in while in the 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.340
 back there is the plate think it's the same 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.610
 than me but I'm going no I'm going to 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.290
 calm 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.000
 i'm just going to qatar so i'm going 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.130
 join the team of France is the 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.050
 fourth month no I got along 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.050
 with you who made a spell to god we 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.790
 left no implied with you 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.380
 who are often left no 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.120
 eliminated and I who wanted you 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.830
 I have made no money have 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.630
 now the technology I do not have 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.370
 did one if I did not do any 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.300
 implied I admit I recognize I 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.460
 do not even need technology 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.169
 it's on my blog and was explained 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.880
 with objective reasons and clear I 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.800
 do not remove a word from what I said 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.030
 and now that the France team 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.919
 is with a new face and with 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.490
 didier deschamps which is part of 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.960
 very good French coaches 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.630
 and has learned nothing in France there 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.910
 understood abroad me there is it 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.160
 he metamorphosed all these evil players 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.800
 educated and poorly trained make me unique 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.630
 yes maybe die because that's the 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.789
 only coach rolls up quickly because 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.259
 which I would like for free as we have 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:44.880
 two minutes as long as they are 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.009
 white laurent come to tell us that they 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.840
 are from France 98 who were 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.139
 blacklisted by a whole corporatism 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.270
 rusted with jealousy and gray when everything 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.430
 done for placarded they are 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.199
 gone to the wheel showed up is with 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.900
 bordeaux he had managed he shows the 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.819
 in psg despite the 70 iata currencies 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.180
 who did not want to see them of course 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.919
 sure
