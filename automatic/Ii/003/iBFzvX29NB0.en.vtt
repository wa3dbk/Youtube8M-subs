00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:09.620
 I like the style of the man. I do not like the style of the man I like . 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.150
 What are you doing? 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.950
 Shoulders and bakgarin nimha live rounds while talking in my house now among women 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.160
 It was clean. 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.760
 So when we talk about it, 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.060
 Baron came out to talk about hope and orientation, so to talk about their propensity 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.060
 I came out. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.790
 Garin Lee's sister's eyes are melting 1 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:39.710
 It's not so high, so your eyes are so unique , 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.280
 There are people who are peanuts, flowers that are to be loved, 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.280
 Style is g 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 He does not like it because he 's subjective and handsome. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.850
 I do not hate to be ugly, 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 Now if you look at the propensity 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:05.729
 But now the man has to have a lot of money. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.950
 I do not have anything for that . 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:16.259
 That is why I am here just to list 2 before it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.030
 Does anyone have this? This guy is like that. 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.049
 Who's to say it's okay. 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.740
 The itgoyo also that it looks a little back and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740
 Yes. 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.079
 This man 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.740
 It just seems like this guy likes me now. 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:43.030
 I guess there are times when I go there and see you once more. 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 Uh geurigu 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.740
 I'm kind of unique. I do not need money . 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.740
 When what is not good, the first factor of the field 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.400
 If the chip potential is plotted 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 Uh-huh . 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.700
 Wasnt going to be president, not just the things that are in the magnetic field 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:12.599
 No , I like the best people in the wheat that I have to do. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 I like that one up to three . 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:23.459
 Clutch. Maybe. I'm on the insurance. So I have the same guy. 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.379
 He's going to the insurance company and he's got a sales network. 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.280
 Say so before 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.280
 That's the connection . It's Rum and he's seeing him again .
