00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.620
 Welcome to another 100 percent 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 tutorial video of me the chance of this 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 times sequence 2 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 the fourth mission and yes at the beginning 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 You must enter the templar of the mission 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 little bit on the track before 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 They are then attacked by Assassin 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 and maybe I'll have a short time 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.110
 flashing see the first optional 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 mission of this mission is in 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.859
 end effect in the fight once the pistol too 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 Do not use this here 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.309
 first assassin simple way 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 Shoot but it is enough if 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 he you see up there is the assassin on 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.010
 tried the roofs with the pistol 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.579
 turn off and then you have too 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.809
 already the mission goal achieved 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.850
 I would like to say that the pistol 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.799
 if you can get a headshot 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.150
 the target immediately kills that means you 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.979
 you should focus on that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.040
 also maybe the headshot 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.780
 directly to try and kill him like 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.939
 you see, you see, and then you see 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.659
 is also on death and that is 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.600
 not that bad 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.070
 after a short further 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 inter-sequence then come immediately 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.270
 will fight after how these 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.830
 The wise have reached 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 and in the end, I want to try too 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.950
 flee then it is your job and that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.650
 is also the second optional 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 mission goal from above to ram 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.920
 and you do that right 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 mouse button and herthas de da you see 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 also the orphans are starting from the top 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.620
 in the end the same thing you use 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.940
 to jump to the courier and I'll show you 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.220
 now a way I very much 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.220
 found helpful you can here 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 Go on the left side and there 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.700
 then you see that he then on about her 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.050
 come down there you can already 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.050
 try to jump in from above 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.630
 Have you just seen this one dare 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.540
 or you just take the long way 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.040
 as well as culture and there you can see that's going on 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.240
 means if he had waited for it 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.930
 would have animals from there already 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.710
 can play 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.450
 There are 22 locations where I show you 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.220
 I really like where I think it is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 goes the first 90 with intention now 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 not to show you in the end 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.040
 that you can try it there you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.390
 should the path was already gang 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.680
 that's one of the hardest things for you 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.450
 then come here to this great courses 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.099
 and could end up here in the end 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.510
 you have these stones from there very much 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.280
 good position because here was the same 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.599
 Run by it would be the same 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 I will not try 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.150
 to jump on said because her next 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.220
 wants to show 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.049
 and then you would have him in the end 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.189
 yes, the next job is to catch 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.540
 you just follow him from this 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.610
 point of view and that is actually 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.740
 where I always 100% 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
 but he waits until he's one way 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.670
 and he will soon be on such a way 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.110
 fence or something like that climbing there 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.790
 Do you see it when he climb over it and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.320
 then he will jump down and close 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.380
 this time you can in the end 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.910
 them from above exactly and there you see it 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 falling off and on at this 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.550
 stelle always jumps 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.030
 below and then you have it too 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.900
 made 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 after a little further 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.600
 you have the intersequence then synonymous 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.070
 mission accomplished i hope it was 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.690
 helpful for you as I said I think 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.070
 It makes perfect sense and that is true 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.370
 i also give a tip that i really give 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.500
 can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.690
 Runs away once vizrt from where it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 go and I tell you the place at the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.290
 Church is actually the best 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.790
 to complete the whole thing yes that should 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.170
 it also has been i hope you have 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.239
 we like it deeply we are again 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.880
 in a 100% tutorial video of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.140
 Assassin's creed four is good because 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.140
 we'll meet
