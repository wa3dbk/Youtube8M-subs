or start a new one

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
or start a new one
and<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> expert<00:00:27.330> mode

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and this is actually the expert mode

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.769 
and this is actually the expert mode
here<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:27.990> playing<00:00:28.320> right<00:00:28.529> now<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.779> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
here that I'm playing right now and the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.840 
here that I'm playing right now and the
way<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:30.990> works<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:32.009> place<00:00:32.340> flowers

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
way it works is you just place flowers

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.630 
way it works is you just place flowers
down<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.590> try<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:35.070> rows<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
down here and you try to make rows of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.080 
down here and you try to make rows of
three<00:00:35.910> flowers<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:38.520> can't<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:38.879> do

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
three flowers and I can't really do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.650 
three flowers and I can't really do
anything<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> once<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.629> through

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
anything there so once you go through

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
anything there so once you go through
all<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> available<00:00:43.620> flowers<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> takes

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
all the available flowers there it takes

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.010 
all the available flowers there it takes
it<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> next<00:00:45.000> level<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.960> see

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it to the next level and as you can see

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.920 
it to the next level and as you can see
I<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.379> 20<00:00:46.800> flowers<00:00:47.160> left<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I have 20 flowers left so you can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.380 
I have 20 flowers left so you can
sometimes<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.550> butterflies<00:00:51.090> let's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
sometimes get these butterflies let's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
sometimes get these butterflies let's
change<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.079> color<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> flowers<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.190> then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
change the color of the flowers and then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
change the color of the flowers and then
you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.120> make<00:00:54.239> combos<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> you'll

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you can make combos like that and you'll

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can make combos like that and you'll
get<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.800> points<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.280> making<00:00:56.840> combos<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
get more points for making combos that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.849 
get more points for making combos that
like<00:00:58.260> interact<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.460> row<00:00:59.870> which<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.260> possible

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
like interact in a row which is possible

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.179 
like interact in a row which is possible
by<00:01:02.129> using<00:01:02.399> those<00:01:03.320> color<00:01:04.320> changing<00:01:04.799> flowers

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
by using those color changing flowers

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
by using those color changing flowers
like<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.909> place<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
like that one that I place when it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
like that one that I place when it
combines<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.659> two<00:01:09.659> other<00:01:09.869> white<00:01:10.140> flowers

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
combines with two other white flowers

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.300 
combines with two other white flowers
it'll<00:01:11.340> turn<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.060> red<00:01:12.270> flower<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:16.310> like

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it'll turn into a red flower and like

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
it'll turn into a red flower and like
here<00:01:17.759> you'll<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.540> happen<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
here you'll see that happen with the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.450 
here you'll see that happen with the
yellow<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> place<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> damn

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
yellow one here when I place it damn

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
yellow one here when I place it damn
turns<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.729> those<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> place

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
turns into those and then when I place

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
turns into those and then when I place
this<00:01:26.549> white<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.479> I'll<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> double

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
this white one here I'll get a double

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
this white one here I'll get a double
combo<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.140> game<00:01:34.290> works

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
combo here so that's how the game works

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.870 
combo here so that's how the game works
and<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> standard<00:01:37.079> mode<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.520> bit

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and the standard mode it's just a bit

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
and the standard mode it's just a bit
easier<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> starts<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> lot<00:01:40.500> easier<00:01:40.530> here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
easier it starts off a lot easier here

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
easier it starts off a lot easier here
with<00:01:41.430> only<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:42.720> single<00:01:43.439> ones<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:45.680> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
with only these single ones here so it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620 
with only these single ones here so it
just<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> helps<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.729> started<00:01:48.180> there

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
just kind of helps you get started there

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.340 
just kind of helps you get started there
and<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.700> eventually<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.659> starts<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> get

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and then eventually it starts to get

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.600 
and then eventually it starts to get
tougher

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.880 

but<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> muds<00:01:57.000> pretty<00:01:57.329> nice

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.790 

so<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.030> sounds<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.630> game<00:02:01.810> are<00:02:02.170> alright

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
so the sounds in the game are alright

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.490 
so the sounds in the game are alright
they're<00:02:03.210> pretty<00:02:04.210> basic<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.720> they<00:02:05.080> definitely

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
they're pretty basic but they definitely

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.140 
they're pretty basic but they definitely
work<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:05.980> this<00:02:06.400> there's<00:02:06.730> no<00:02:06.850> background

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
work for this there's no background

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.930 
work for this there's no background
music<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.979> that's<00:02:09.280> okay

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
music but that's okay

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.390 
music but that's okay
it's<00:02:10.360> workable<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:16.570> visuals<00:02:17.020> are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it's workable and the visuals are

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.830 
it's workable and the visuals are
alright<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.850> mean<00:02:19.480> they're<00:02:19.660> nothing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
alright I mean they're nothing

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.590 
alright I mean they're nothing
impressive<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:21.030> they're<00:02:22.030> fine<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
impressive but they're fine for this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.120 
impressive but they're fine for this
game<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.020> just<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.470> puzzle<00:02:23.830> game<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
game it's just a little puzzle game it

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.600
