ones to Slade let's verify the both of
them<00:02:42.650> are<00:02:42.770> detected<00:02:44.020> I'm<00:02:45.020> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> click<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
them are detected I'm going to click the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.780 
them are detected I'm going to click the
front<00:02:49.780> enter<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.890> let<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.040> run<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.310> through<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
front enter so let it run on through the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.840 
front enter so let it run on through the
bios<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.270> see<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.660> happens<00:02:56.800> boom<00:02:57.800> there<00:02:58.730> we

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
bios and see what happens boom there we

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.720 
bios and see what happens boom there we
go<00:02:59.060> right<00:02:59.330> there<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.560> says<00:03:00.590> detective<00:03:01.310> master

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
go right there it says detective master

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
go right there it says detective master
and<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.600> detected<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.590> slave<00:03:03.800> drive<00:03:04.100> as<00:03:04.250> well

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
and it detected the slave drive as well

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.160 
and it detected the slave drive as well
so<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:05.900> seeing<00:03:06.200> both<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.470> them<00:03:07.720> now<00:03:08.720> we<00:03:08.780> need

so it's seeing both of them now we need

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.130 
so it's seeing both of them now we need
to<00:03:09.200> go<00:03:09.470> verifying<00:03:10.070> disk<00:03:10.340> management<00:03:10.840> how<00:03:11.840> it's

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
to go verifying disk management how it's
