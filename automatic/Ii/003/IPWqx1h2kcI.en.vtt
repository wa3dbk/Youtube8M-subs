back<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.479> give<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.380> set<00:01:51.920> up<00:01:51.950> picture

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
back and give you the set up picture

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.819 
back and give you the set up picture
okay<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.750> got<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.899> tree<00:01:54.109> here<00:01:54.320> another<00:01:54.590> tree

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
okay so I got a tree here another tree

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.569 
okay so I got a tree here another tree
down<00:01:54.979> there<00:01:55.270> let's<00:01:56.270> see<00:01:56.420> how<00:01:57.310> long<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.520> needs

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
down there let's see how long it needs

00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:59.980 
down there let's see how long it needs
to<00:01:58.789> be<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.119> don't<00:01:59.329> really<00:01:59.450> know<00:01:59.600> how<00:01:59.719> long<00:01:59.869> the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
to be I don't really know how long the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.980 
to be I don't really know how long the
tethers<00:02:00.289> are<00:02:00.439> yet<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:00.909> here<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.060> cords<00:02:02.390> you

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
tethers are yet but here the cords you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.709 
tethers are yet but here the cords you
get<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:04.570> steel<00:02:05.570> carabiner<00:02:06.049> on<00:02:06.520> each<00:02:07.520> in

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.720 

and<00:02:12.719> let's<00:02:12.959> take<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:13.319> at<00:02:13.439> these<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:14.640> we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and let's take a look at these see we

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
and let's take a look at these see we
got<00:02:14.879> here<00:02:14.939> so<00:02:15.329> we<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.569> two<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.379> these<00:02:16.469> paracord

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
got here so we got two of these paracord

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.080 
got here so we got two of these paracord
loops<00:02:18.109> and<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.459> see<00:02:20.459> there<00:02:20.609> long<00:02:20.790> enough<00:02:20.909> to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
loops and you see there long enough to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.170 
loops and you see there long enough to
go<00:02:21.209> around<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> tree<00:02:22.069> like<00:02:23.069> with<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> larks

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
go around the tree like with a larks

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.819 
go around the tree like with a larks
head<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.599> they<00:02:25.079> got<00:02:25.260> different<00:02:25.349> knots<00:02:25.650> in

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
head and they got different knots in

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.069 
head and they got different knots in
them<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.129> adjustments<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> little

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
them for adjustments so so it's a little

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.319 
them for adjustments so so it's a little
closer<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.379> should<00:02:28.530> add<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.709> thing<00:02:28.859> sets<00:02:29.129> up

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
closer and should add this thing sets up

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.750 
closer and should add this thing sets up
okay<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.569> usually<00:02:31.079> set<00:02:31.290> my<00:02:31.319> hammock<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.890> put<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
okay I usually set my hammock up put the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.089 
okay I usually set my hammock up put the
Rope<00:02:32.909> up<00:02:33.120> we'll<00:02:33.780> run<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.049> through<00:02:34.109> here<00:02:34.470> just

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
Rope up we'll run it through here just

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.619 
Rope up we'll run it through here just
like<00:02:35.189> this<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.579> make<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> large<00:02:36.420> head

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
like this this make like a large head

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.229 
like this this make like a large head
right<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.049> see<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.189> so<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.639> actually<00:02:38.970> put

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
right you see that so I actually put

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.970 
right you see that so I actually put
this<00:02:39.329> about<00:02:39.629> six<00:02:40.109> foot<00:02:40.290> high<00:02:40.439> so<00:02:40.769> we're<00:02:40.889> not

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this about six foot high so we're not

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000 
this about six foot high so we're not
ballpark<00:02:42.109> okay<00:02:43.109> then<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> wind<00:02:43.709> up<00:02:43.799> having

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ballpark okay then you wind up having

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.559 
ballpark okay then you wind up having
these<00:02:44.400> different<00:02:44.579> knots<00:02:44.939> that<00:02:45.299> give<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
these different knots that give you

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.990 
these different knots that give you
different<00:02:45.599> adjustment<00:02:46.260> points<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.909> you

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
different adjustment points and if you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.849 
different adjustment points and if you
need<00:02:48.120> another<00:02:48.329> adjustment<00:02:48.810> point<00:02:49.019> tie

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
need another adjustment point tie

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.539 
need another adjustment point tie
another<00:02:49.980> knot<00:02:50.099> right<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:52.040> got<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.129> carabiner

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
another knot right so got the carabiner

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.129 
another knot right so got the carabiner
which<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.060> kind<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.419> prefer<00:02:54.540> some<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.049> the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
which I kind of prefer some of the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.809 
which I kind of prefer some of the
lower-priced<00:02:55.560> hammocks<00:02:56.159> I've<00:02:56.280> seen<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.669> just

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
lower-priced hammocks I've seen and just

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.300 
lower-priced hammocks I've seen and just
got<00:02:56.970> s<00:02:57.180> hooks<00:02:57.389> here<00:02:57.599> which<00:02:58.349> are<00:02:58.799> prone<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
got s hooks here which are prone to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.979 
got s hooks here which are prone to
falling<00:02:59.609> out<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.000> has<00:03:00.120> got<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.329> actual<00:03:00.780> steel

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
falling out this has got a actual steel

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.170 
falling out this has got a actual steel
carabiner<00:03:01.439> so<00:03:01.500> we're<00:03:01.709> gonna<00:03:01.799> put<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
carabiner so we're gonna put it the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
carabiner so we're gonna put it the
second<00:03:03.629> one<00:03:03.720> from<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> top<00:03:03.989> now<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.439> see

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
second one from the top now and you see

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.589 
second one from the top now and you see
that<00:03:04.739> gives<00:03:04.889> us<00:03:05.010> about<00:03:05.159> two<00:03:05.549> feet<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:06.030> which

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
that gives us about two feet here which

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.750 
that gives us about two feet here which
hopefully<00:03:07.169> if<00:03:07.409> my<00:03:07.530> estimations<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:08.489> should

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
hopefully if my estimations right should

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.490 
hopefully if my estimations right should
be<00:03:08.849> about<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.269> right<00:03:09.389> distance<00:03:09.419> let's<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.409> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
be about the right distance let's go the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.899 
be about the right distance let's go the
other<00:03:10.590> tree<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.099> I'll<00:03:11.189> cut<00:03:11.430> back<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.849> a

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
other tree and I'll cut back to you in a

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.780 
other tree and I'll cut back to you in a
second<00:03:12.239> okay<00:03:12.709> house<00:03:13.709> which<00:03:13.919> trees<00:03:14.280> because<00:03:14.609> my

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
second okay house which trees because my

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.039 
second okay house which trees because my
other<00:03:14.909> one<00:03:15.060> was<00:03:15.239> too<00:03:15.479> far<00:03:15.780> off<00:03:15.989> my

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
other one was too far off my

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.289 
other one was too far off my
guesstimation<00:03:17.010> was<00:03:17.129> not<00:03:17.280> good<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.760> we're

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
guesstimation was not good so we're

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.430 
guesstimation was not good so we're
gonna<00:03:18.389> do<00:03:18.479> the<00:03:18.569> same<00:03:18.720> thing<00:03:19.019> I'm<00:03:19.290> actually

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
gonna do the same thing I'm actually

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
gonna do the same thing I'm actually
just<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.769> clip<00:03:19.979> this<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.370> my<00:03:20.489> pocket<00:03:20.849> for<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
just gonna clip this on my pocket for a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.180 
just gonna clip this on my pocket for a
minute<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.709> dragging<00:03:22.919> on<00:03:23.159> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
minute so it's not dragging on the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.309 
minute so it's not dragging on the
ground<00:03:23.599> take<00:03:24.599> this<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> loop<00:03:26.959> about<00:03:27.959> six

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
ground take this take the loop about six

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.819 
ground take this take the loop about six
foot<00:03:28.470> high<00:03:28.620> pull<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.699> through<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.599> like<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
foot high pull it through just like that

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.569 
foot high pull it through just like that
same<00:03:31.829> thing<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.190> sin<00:03:32.419> then<00:03:34.430> take<00:03:35.430> my

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
same thing in the sin then take my

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.140 
same thing in the sin then take my
hammock<00:03:35.909> and<00:03:36.629> hook<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.989> o<00:03:37.169> say<00:03:37.940> probably<00:03:38.940> hero

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
hammock and hook it o say probably hero

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.089 
hammock and hook it o say probably hero
this<00:03:39.329> time<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.659> the<00:03:39.720> first<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:40.799> a

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
this time on the first one and a

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.439 
this time on the first one and a
probably<00:03:41.400> gonna<00:03:41.489> line<00:03:41.609> up<00:03:41.639> going<00:03:41.970> back<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
probably gonna line up going back and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.909 
probably gonna line up going back and
moving<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:43.079> up<00:03:43.199> one<00:03:43.349> cuz<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.620> think<00:03:43.680> this

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
moving that one up one cuz I think this

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.170 
moving that one up one cuz I think this
might<00:03:44.069> be<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.340> looser<00:03:44.639> than<00:03:44.819> I<00:03:44.879> like<00:03:45.030> my

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
might be a little looser than I like my

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.240 
might be a little looser than I like my
hammock<00:03:45.479> but<00:03:45.599> we'll<00:03:45.900> try<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.199> see<00:03:46.319> okay<00:03:47.190> so

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
hammock but we'll try and see okay so

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.219 
hammock but we'll try and see okay so
here<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.459> guys<00:03:47.579> now<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.299> see<00:03:48.569> see<00:03:49.079> how

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
here we guys now and you see see how

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.780 
here we guys now and you see see how
typically<00:03:50.159> he's<00:03:50.280> going<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.459> stretch<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.669> little

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
typically he's going to stretch a little

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.229 
typically he's going to stretch a little
bit

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
bit

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.030 
bit
so<00:03:51.569> like<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.930> say<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.229> is<00:03:52.409> PI<00:03:52.590> little<00:03:52.799> lower

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
so like I say this is PI little lower

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.309 
so like I say this is PI little lower
than<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.879> like<00:03:54.120> something<00:03:55.019> we're<00:03:55.109> just<00:03:55.229> gonna

than I like something we're just gonna
raise<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.799> little<00:03:56.010> bit

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.990 

okay<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:02.710> this<00:04:03.710> is<00:04:03.890> about<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.400> perfect<00:04:04.670> height

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000

not a big deal and you may I may want
I'm<00:04:36.980> doing<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.310> here<00:04:37.520> because<00:04:37.640> as<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
I'm doing that here because as it

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.820 
I'm doing that here because as it
stretches<00:04:38.930> out<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.080> guess<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.530> see<00:04:39.710> it's

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
stretches out I guess you see it's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.800 
stretches out I guess you see it's
gotten<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.040> little<00:04:40.100> lower<00:04:40.340> already<00:04:40.760> okay<00:04:41.660> if

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
gotten a little lower already okay if

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.540 
gotten a little lower already okay if
you<00:04:41.900> do<00:04:42.110> decide<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.680> want<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.860> shorten<00:04:43.220> your

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550

rope<00:04:43.760> up<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.270> just<00:04:44.510> toss<00:04:44.720> Slipknot<00:04:45.170> in<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.410> like

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
rope up I just toss Slipknot in it like

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.740 
rope up I just toss Slipknot in it like
this<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.180> think<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.420> learned<00:04:47.600> this<00:04:47.690> from

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
this and I think I learned this from

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.400 
this and I think I learned this from
Dave<00:04:47.990> Canterbury<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.530> be<00:04:48.590> honest<00:04:48.800> with<00:04:48.950> you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
Dave Canterbury to be honest with you

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.870 
Dave Canterbury to be honest with you
because<00:04:51.410> it's<00:04:51.710> easy<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.950> get<00:04:52.130> out<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.760> can

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
because it's easy to get out and you can

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.520 
because it's easy to get out and you can
you<00:04:53.030> can<00:04:53.090> hook<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.420> right<00:04:53.450> up<00:04:53.690> here<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.410> like

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
you can hook it right up here just like

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.680 
you can hook it right up here just like
just<00:04:55.010> like<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:58.280> when<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.180> pulls<00:04:59.450> tight

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
just like this and when it pulls tight

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.420 
just like this and when it pulls tight
you<00:04:59.870> got<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.050> slipknot<00:05:00.320> here<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.710> can<00:05:01.130> pull<00:05:01.310> out

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
you got a slipknot here you can pull out

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.130 
you got a slipknot here you can pull out
so<00:05:01.700> if<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:02.090> want<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.330> remove<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:02.720> knot<00:05:02.930> you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
so if you want to remove this knot you

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.410 
so if you want to remove this knot you
can<00:05:03.400> it's<00:05:04.400> really<00:05:04.580> nice<00:05:04.760> when<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:05.060> sit<00:05:05.270> down

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
can it's really nice when we sit down
