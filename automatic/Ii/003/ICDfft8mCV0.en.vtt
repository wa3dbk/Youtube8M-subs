burnout hope he said the throttle that's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.829 
burnout hope he said the throttle that's
indication<00:00:11.940> he's<00:00:12.059> having<00:00:12.269> trouble<00:00:12.389> getting

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:12.839 
indication he's having trouble getting

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.570 
indication he's having trouble getting
that<00:00:12.900> thing<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.349> gear<00:00:13.379> Wow

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
that thing into gear Wow

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.819 
that thing into gear Wow
and<00:00:15.029> if<00:00:15.240> he<00:00:15.389> can't<00:00:15.719> he<00:00:15.959> just<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.439> motor<00:00:16.710> on

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:16.829 
and if he can't he just got a motor on

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.249 
and if he can't he just got a motor on
down<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.340> course<00:00:17.610> and<00:00:17.880> lose<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.449> round<00:00:18.900> I

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
down the course and lose this round I

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.140 
down the course and lose this round I
would<00:00:19.560> normally<00:00:19.890> try<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.610> here<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.849> you<00:00:20.939> try

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
would normally try to do here is you try

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
would normally try to do here is you try
to<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> idle<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.930> slow<00:00:22.169> down<00:00:22.349> because

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to get the idle to slow down because

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.850 
to get the idle to slow down because
it's<00:00:22.829> a<00:00:22.919> trivial<00:00:23.489> clutch<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.259> basically

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
it's a trivial clutch and it's basically

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.619 
it's a trivial clutch and it's basically
you<00:00:25.950> cannot<00:00:26.340> disengage<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:27.090> clutch<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.540> if

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:27.629 
you cannot disengage the clutch so if

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.299 
you cannot disengage the clutch so if
the<00:00:27.689> idols<00:00:27.960> too<00:00:28.140> high<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.410> central<00:00:29.009> force

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
the idols too high this central force

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.249 
the idols too high this central force
puts<00:00:30.059> pressure<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.540> that<00:00:30.660> clutch<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:31.169> then

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
puts pressure on that clutch and then

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.900 
puts pressure on that clutch and then
you<00:00:31.379> can't<00:00:31.649> get<00:00:31.829> it<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> gear

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.630 

what's<00:00:37.540> going<00:00:37.870> on<00:00:38.020> it's<00:00:38.380> a<00:00:38.530> coke<00:00:38.830> part<00:00:39.100> fix<00:00:39.460> it

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
what's going on it's a coke part fix it

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.880 
what's going on it's a coke part fix it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
fit report well as we said if the idols

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.890 
fit report well as we said if the idols
too<00:00:42.040> high<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:42.280> can't<00:00:42.670> get<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.120> gear<00:00:43.300> Soviet

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
too high you can't get it in gear Soviet

too high you can't get it in gear Soviet
crew<00:00:44.470> member<00:00:44.740> there<00:00:44.920> was<00:00:45.100> pushing<00:00:45.430> on<00:00:45.490> the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
crew member there was pushing on the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.730 
crew member there was pushing on the
bottom<00:00:45.970> of<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.210> injector<00:00:46.750> what<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.320> does<00:00:47.560> is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
bottom of the injector what that does is

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.470 
bottom of the injector what that does is
try<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.040> slow<00:00:48.490> the<00:00:48.670> idle<00:00:48.970> down<00:00:49.090> by<00:00:49.270> letting

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
try to slow the idle down by letting

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.000 
try to slow the idle down by letting
less<00:00:49.690> air<00:00:49.960> go<00:00:50.200> in<00:00:50.350> there<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.650> hopefully<00:00:50.920> help

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
less air go in there to hopefully help

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.630 
less air go in there to hopefully help
them<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:51.580> gear<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:53.830> huge<00:00:54.250> moment

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
them get it in gear what a huge moment

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.510 
them get it in gear what a huge moment
for<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.150> points<00:00:55.660> John<00:00:55.989> Force<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.860> Robert
