00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.209
 [Applause] 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.090
 the draw with Ypiranga was more than 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.740
 than the absolute leadership of the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.600
 not just a group 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.810
 but in the general context of the championship 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.840
 Gaucho the two groups and it was worth even more 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 technician because of the performance of the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 team up the team and then me and me 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.900
 I want to express and get a beating 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.800
 key to the strength of a team your 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.590
 group is to have the possibilities of the 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 to go to work seriously applied with 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.239
 compete between them have the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.560
 respect that today can only play more 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.540
 competed among them so that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.380
 perform as it was the result did not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.610
 was better 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.080
 surely it was not for lack of 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.020
 performance was lacking the final finish 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.090
 until the final meshing failed but 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.530
 until goal situations were created and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.760
 wasted is true but they 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.380
 they existed 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.570
 This makes me happy because I 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.170
 I understand football in some respects. 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.910
 dominated dominated and controlled the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.450
 game gave no chance of the opponent and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.910
 controlled created created then joined those 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.590
 three factors is the performance signal 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.670
 finish it sometimes is the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.080
 happiness is given by the precision or 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.850
 coordination has not been lacking because 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.799
 this team has never played together how 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.470
 shape this performance you have 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.390
 players who did not come together 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.430
 others like the case of walter lira 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.340
 Julian who arrived from the national team 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.630
 brazilian is a challenge is the knowledge 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.340
 that the kleber has above all 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.140
 individual characteristics that the group 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.910
 you go from knowing more and did not know 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.670
 both Julian but knowing that it works 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.440
 can exercise knowing that they are in the victim 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.420
 already brought them because the need that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.340
 had missed wedges and missed the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.709
 d'Alessandro the game I had 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.329
 they can both work in the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.890
 below international level must be 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.630
