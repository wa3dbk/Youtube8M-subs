00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
underneath here you can see it used to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690

be as tall as uh right here on the other
side<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> did<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.430> took<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> little

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
side what I did is I just took a little

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.790 
side what I did is I just took a little
hacksaw<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.719> cut<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.200> plastic<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
hacksaw and cut some of this plastic so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.850 
hacksaw and cut some of this plastic so
that<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:42.320> compressor<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.469> sit<00:00:43.710> inside

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that this compressor would sit inside

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490 
that this compressor would sit inside
there<00:00:44.190> nice<00:00:44.930> come<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.170> top<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
there nice come up on top of the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.209 
there nice come up on top of the
compressor<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.590> let's<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> go

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
compressor and let's see there you go

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
compressor and let's see there you go
you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you can see it's just right up just a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.779 
you can see it's just right up just a
little<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> space<00:00:53.010> between<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.460> battery

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
little bit of space between the battery

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
little bit of space between the battery
and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> compressor<00:00:54.360> itself<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.489> rotated<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and the compressor itself I rotated the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.389 
and the compressor itself I rotated the
compressor<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> right<00:00:58.680> excuse<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
compressor to the right excuse me to the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.430 
did hook up the power since you guys
could<00:02:14.570> see<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.410> dump<00:02:15.620> on<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:16.420> underneath

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
could see the dump on there underneath

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.690 
could see the dump on there underneath
here<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.020> see<00:02:22.630> right<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
here you can see right there is the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.910 
here you can see right there is the
fitting<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> bottom<00:02:26.480> now<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.500> comes<00:02:27.740> out

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
fitting on the bottom now this comes out

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.190 
fitting on the bottom now this comes out
I<00:02:28.250> ran<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> back<00:02:29.330> up<00:02:29.510> through<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> hole<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I ran it back up through the hole on the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.190 
I ran it back up through the hole on the
bottom<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:31.550> comes<00:02:32.360> into<00:02:32.510> our<00:02:32.600> tee<00:02:32.840> fitting

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
bottom and comes into our tee fitting

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.900 
bottom and comes into our tee fitting
here<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.610> where<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.610> see<00:02:37.760> where

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
here so you see where you can see where

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.210 
here so you see where you can see where
I<00:02:37.940> uh<00:02:38.470> ran<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.620> up<00:02:39.740> there<00:02:39.890> through<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I uh ran that up there through the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.270 
I uh ran that up there through the
bottom<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.820> into<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.780> tee<00:02:41.960> fitting<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:43.100> tee

and<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.520> saddlebags<00:02:56.000> on<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.360> will<00:02:56.480> sit

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
and put the saddlebags on this will sit

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.790 
and put the saddlebags on this will sit
right<00:02:56.690> behind<00:02:56.900> everything<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.560> won't<00:02:57.710> be

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
right behind everything so it won't be

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.880

coming off of here I've got the air line

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.420 
coming off of here I've got the air line
running<00:03:12.440> up<00:03:12.590> again<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> be

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
running up again this is going to be

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.370 
running up again this is going to be
hidden<00:03:13.640> by<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.940> stretch<00:03:14.480> side<00:03:14.690> covers<00:03:15.050> behind

hidden by the stretch side covers behind
the<00:03:15.440> saddlebag<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.330> ran<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.450> up<00:03:17.540> underneath

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
the saddlebag I ran it up underneath

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.670 
the saddlebag I ran it up underneath
here<00:03:18.620> through<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:18.920> wiring<00:03:19.130> harness<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:21.560> we

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
here through that wiring harness then we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.830 
here through that wiring harness then we
move<00:03:21.830> up<00:03:22.010> top<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:24.740> can<00:03:24.860> see<00:03:25.040> right<00:03:25.220> there

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
move up top you can see right there

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.710 
move up top you can see right there
that's<00:03:26.840> your<00:03:27.080> air<00:03:27.230> line<00:03:27.470> down<00:03:27.740> there<00:03:28.510> ran<00:03:29.510> up

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
that's your air line down there ran up

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.190 
that's your air line down there ran up
behind<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.530> battery<00:03:30.860> compartment<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:32.200> just

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
behind the battery compartment and just

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.630 
behind the battery compartment and just
run<00:03:33.410> straight<00:03:33.740> over<00:03:34.070> here<00:03:36.370> goes<00:03:37.370> underneath

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
run straight over here goes underneath

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.580 
run straight over here goes underneath
those<00:03:37.880> wires<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.420> tee<00:03:38.600> fitting<00:03:38.810> so

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
those wires to the tee fitting so

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.350 
those wires to the tee fitting so
everything's<00:03:40.070> out<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.430> way<00:03:40.580> nothing<00:03:41.270> is

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
everything's out of the way nothing is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.949 
everything's out of the way nothing is
kinked<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:44.600> should<00:03:44.959> be<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.170> good<00:03:45.410> install

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
kinked and it should be a good install

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.480 
kinked and it should be a good install
from<00:03:47.959> there<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.820> see<00:03:49.970> here<00:03:50.270> is<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:52.130> three

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
from there you can see here is the three

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.210 
from there you can see here is the three
position<00:03:52.850> switch<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.270> comes<00:03:53.450> with<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.220> was

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
position switch that comes with it I was

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.880 
position switch that comes with it I was
trying<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.670> mount<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.470> underneath<00:03:57.470> here

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
trying to mount this underneath here

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.240 
trying to mount this underneath here
using<00:03:58.190> one<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.340> those<00:03:59.860> one<00:04:00.860> of<00:04:00.890> those<00:04:01.040> two

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
using one of those one of those two

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.580 
using one of those one of those two
holes<00:04:01.750> I'm<00:04:02.750> gonna<00:04:02.870> have<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.050> touch<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.500> a

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
holes I'm gonna have to touch it up a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.840 
holes I'm gonna have to touch it up a
little<00:04:03.740> bit<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.950> touch-up<00:04:04.130> paint<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.580> couldn't

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
little bit of touch-up paint I couldn't

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.310 
little bit of touch-up paint I couldn't
get<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.060> couldn't<00:04:05.690> quite<00:04:05.780> get<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.110> fit

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
get it couldn't quite get it to fit

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.410 
get it couldn't quite get it to fit
couldn't<00:04:06.680> find<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.920> small<00:04:07.730> enough<00:04:07.910> switch<00:04:08.240> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
couldn't find a small enough switch to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.690 
couldn't find a small enough switch to
fit<00:04:08.630> in<00:04:08.750> there<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.010> decided<00:04:10.310> what<00:04:10.430> I'm<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.580> do

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
fit in there so I decided what I'm to do

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.780 
fit in there so I decided what I'm to do
is<00:04:10.820> take<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.030> auxilary<00:04:12.370> little<00:04:13.370> auxiliary

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
is take that auxilary little auxiliary

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.280 
is take that auxilary little auxiliary
lighting<00:04:14.150> area<00:04:14.510> or<00:04:14.660> maybe<00:04:14.840> I'll<00:04:14.959> just<00:04:15.080> wire<00:04:15.200> it

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
lighting area or maybe I'll just wire it

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.340 
lighting area or maybe I'll just wire it
inside<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.590> one<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:15.830> glove<00:04:16.010> boxes<00:04:17.260> in<00:04:18.260> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
inside of one of the glove boxes in the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.539 
inside of one of the glove boxes in the
faring<00:04:18.650> once<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:18.890> go<00:04:18.980> ahead<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.130> put<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.340> back

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
faring once I go ahead and put that back

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.670

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
right now the the fairing the bikes up

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.690 
right now the the fairing the bikes up
on<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> stand<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:04.710> everything<00:05:05.310> else<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.610> it

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
on the stand and everything else so it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.370 
on the stand and everything else so it
doesn't<00:05:05.940> have<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> whole<00:05:06.300> whole<00:05:06.990> lot<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.229> weight

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
doesn't have a whole whole lot of weight

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.659 
doesn't have a whole whole lot of weight
on<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.590> bike<00:05:07.770> once<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.610> comes<00:05:08.790> off<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> stand

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
on the bike once it comes off the stand

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.570 
on the bike once it comes off the stand
it<00:05:11.669> should<00:05:12.000> dump<00:05:12.240> much<00:05:12.960> quicker<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:14.490> was

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
it should dump much quicker it was

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.790 
it should dump much quicker it was
actually<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> very<00:05:15.000> easy<00:05:15.300> install<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.620> thing

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
actually a very easy install the thing

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.159 
actually a very easy install the thing
that<00:05:16.919> took<00:05:17.070> me<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.280> longest<00:05:17.720> was<00:05:18.720> figuring

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
that took me the longest was figuring

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.129 
that took me the longest was figuring
out<00:05:19.290> how<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.490> where<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.639> mount<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.960> once

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
out how and where to mount this but once

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.150 
out how and where to mount this but once
we<00:05:22.260> get<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.650> done<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:25.200> actual<00:05:25.350> hook-up<00:05:25.889> of

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
we get that done the actual hook-up of

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680 
we get that done the actual hook-up of
the<00:05:26.400> airline's<00:05:27.000> everything<00:05:27.330> else<00:05:27.419> only<00:05:27.630> took

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
the airline's everything else only took

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.440 
the airline's everything else only took
about<00:05:27.750> 15<00:05:28.200> minutes<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:28.940> using<00:05:29.940> this<00:05:30.030> video<00:05:30.330> if

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
about 15 minutes so using this video if

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.060 
about 15 minutes so using this video if
you<00:05:30.570> have<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:31.050> bike<00:05:31.320> that's<00:05:31.530> similar<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:31.949> can

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
you have a bike that's similar you can

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.950 
you have a bike that's similar you can
probably<00:05:32.280> mount<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.729> same<00:05:32.940> way<00:05:33.150> it's

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
probably mount it the same way it's

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.480 
probably mount it the same way it's
installed<00:05:34.410> probably<00:05:34.800> taking<00:05:35.039> all<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.250> an<00:05:35.340> hour

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
installed probably taking all of an hour

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.070 
installed probably taking all of an hour
maybe<00:05:35.970> now<00:05:36.180> we're<00:05:36.270> gonna<00:05:36.360> have<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.720> complete

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
maybe now we're gonna have to complete

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.330 
maybe now we're gonna have to complete
and<00:05:37.850> that's<00:05:38.850> it<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.740> if<00:05:40.740> anybody's<00:05:41.160> singing

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
and that's it so if anybody's singing

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.330 
and that's it so if anybody's singing
about<00:05:41.430> getting<00:05:41.669> that<00:05:41.760> exotic<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.889> exotic

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
about getting that exotic the exotic

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.450 
about getting that exotic the exotic
drop<00:05:44.690> suspension<00:05:45.690> kit<00:05:45.930> for<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.460> touring

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
drop suspension kit for the touring

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.020 
drop suspension kit for the touring
bikes<00:05:47.930> seems<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.020> be<00:05:49.110> pretty<00:05:49.380> solid<00:05:49.560> build

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
bikes seems to be pretty solid build

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:58.010 
bikes seems to be pretty solid build
very<00:05:51.030> easy<00:05:51.240> install<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:54.770> from<00:05:55.770> there<00:05:55.979> I<00:05:57.020> guess

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
very easy install and from there I guess

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.089 
very easy install and from there I guess
that<00:05:58.320> is<00:05:58.530> about<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.760> so<00:06:00.800> we're<00:06:01.800> in<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:01.950> middle
