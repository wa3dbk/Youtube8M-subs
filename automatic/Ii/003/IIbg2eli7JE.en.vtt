a floral wire the first thing you want
to<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> choose<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> appropriate<00:00:21.539> ribbon

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
I've chosen a deep chocolate brown

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.109 
I've chosen a deep chocolate brown
ribbon<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.039> coffee<00:00:26.250> basket<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
ribbon to go with this coffee basket and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
ribbon to go with this coffee basket and
I've<00:00:27.630> chosen<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> wider<00:00:28.650> width

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
I've chosen a bit of a wider width

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.049 
I've chosen a bit of a wider width
because<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.970> larger<00:00:30.359> sized<00:00:30.570> basket<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
because it's a larger sized basket I

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
because it's a larger sized basket I
like<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> leave<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> ribbon<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> spool

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
like to leave the ribbon on the spool

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
like to leave the ribbon on the spool
because<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.850> don't<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.120> exactly<00:00:36.239> how<00:00:36.690> much

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
because you don't know exactly how much

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
because you don't know exactly how much
you're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.980> then<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> don't

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you're going to use and then you don't

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
you're going to use and then you don't
end<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.629> short<00:00:40.200> sided<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.230> first

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
end up with a short sided so the first

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.560 
end up with a short sided so the first
thing<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.600> pinch<00:00:47.570> about

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
thing you want to do is to pinch about

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
thing you want to do is to pinch about
two<00:00:48.840> inches<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> ribbon<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
two inches up on the ribbon this is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
two inches up on the ribbon this is
going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.430> end<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.700> being<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> tail<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> your

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
going to end up being the tail of your

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
going to end up being the tail of your
bow<00:00:52.070> pinch<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.250> together<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bow pinch it together you're going to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.950 
bow pinch it together you're going to
make<00:00:54.989> loops<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.610> forth<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.690> loops

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
make loops back and forth so your loops

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
make loops back and forth so your loops
are<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> grow<00:00:58.649> equally<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.640> go

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
are going to grow equally as you go

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.750 
are going to grow equally as you go
you're<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> flip<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> over<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.760> then

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you're going to flip it over and then

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
you're going to flip it over and then
once<00:01:03.059> again<00:01:03.210> grab<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.650> thumb<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:06.080> your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
once again grab with your thumb and your

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
once again grab with your thumb and your
pointer<00:01:07.380> finger<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> other<00:01:08.610> side<00:01:09.170> make

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pointer finger on the other side make

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.179 
pointer finger on the other side make
the<00:01:10.380> equal<00:01:10.830> side<00:01:12.049> loop<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> other<00:01:13.740> side

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the equal side loop on the other side

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.200 
the equal side loop on the other side
and<00:01:14.580> again<00:01:15.000> turn<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.130> time<00:01:17.460> we're

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and again turn it now this time we're

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
and again turn it now this time we're
going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> build<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.530> I'd<00:01:19.770> say

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going to build it a little bit I'd say

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.420 
going to build it a little bit I'd say
half<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.369> inch<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.220> keep

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
half an inch and you just keep

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
half an inch and you just keep
alternating<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.390> forth<00:01:24.740> not

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
alternating back and forth not

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.760 
alternating back and forth not
forgetting<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.020> flip<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
forgetting to flip it so that the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
forgetting to flip it so that the
correct<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> ribbon<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> showing

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
correct side of the ribbon is showing

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
correct side of the ribbon is showing
for<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.869> basket<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> five

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
for this basket I'm going to do five

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
for this basket I'm going to do five
loops<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.060> both<00:01:33.090> sides<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.680> always<00:01:38.280> keep<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
loops on both sides and always keep the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:50.470 
loops on both sides and always keep the
same<00:01:41.509> distance<00:01:42.509> between<00:01:43.079> each<00:01:43.290> one

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.030 

the<00:01:51.480> trick<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:51.900> do<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.200> fast<00:01:52.470> enough<00:01:52.680> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the trick is to do it fast enough so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.820 
the trick is to do it fast enough so
your<00:01:53.190> fingers<00:01:53.550> don't<00:01:53.760> cramp<00:01:57.410> we've<00:01:58.410> got<00:01:58.650> our

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
your fingers don't cramp we've got our

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:09.609 
your fingers don't cramp we've got our
force<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.440> need<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.830> more<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.550> each<00:02:08.790> side

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
force so we need one more on each side

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.810 
force so we need one more on each side
the<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.460> keep<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.790> mind

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
the other thing you want to keep in mind

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.660 
the other thing you want to keep in mind
is<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.330> don't<00:02:12.570> want<00:02:12.780> your<00:02:12.990> bow<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.400> wider

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
is you don't want your bow to be wider

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.350 
is you don't want your bow to be wider
than<00:02:14.820> your<00:02:15.150> basket<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.610> want<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.090> sure

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
than your basket so you want to be sure

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.710 
than your basket so you want to be sure
to<00:02:18.570> grow<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.020> loops<00:02:19.230> big<00:02:19.590> enough<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
to grow the loops big enough so that it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.070 
to grow the loops big enough so that it
looks<00:02:21.930> appropriate<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.800> not<00:02:22.950> too<00:02:23.190> big

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
looks appropriate but not too big

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
looks appropriate but not too big
so<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.380> overpowers<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.340> basket<00:02:26.850> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
so that it overpowers the basket you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940 
so that it overpowers the basket you
want<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> nice<00:02:28.380> finishing

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
