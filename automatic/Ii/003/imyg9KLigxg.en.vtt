00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.430
 so it is about us 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
 engine checkboxes engines istanbul 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:10.459
 but which 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.469
 I put the scheme 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.279
 benzopyrene 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.150
 yes chainsaws had to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 look back over led percent 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.089
 This radio are able to change angles 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.400
 ignition timing depending on 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.419
 engine rotation 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.609
 What can not do a head unit 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.890
 length 150 which are put on 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.879
 most provotorov last 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.060
 time 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.960
 so council restaurants 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.500
 we have a scale 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.020
 degrees 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.580
 and goalkeepers set aptly 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.000
 which corresponds to zero 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.310
 degrees 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.330
 or top dead center 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.170
 here you can see how 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.190
 tape recorder stand 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.880
 it costs me 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.580
 I confess honestly in the tape trio 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.489
 because a lot 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
 it was difficult to deliver 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.820
 existing seat 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 here and keep in mind that the magnet 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 and I'm talking about naked relatively 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.410
 rotor with magnets in four different 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.420
 Drik positions are more accurate than the position of this idea 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.750
 plesch pardon 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.370
 in either his right side so here 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.440
 radio works only in one 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.730
 positions 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.640
 the team against the background of this capital table 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.560
 standard 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.970
 rotor 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 which stands on move and mars 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.720
 using mini 4 simonini 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 mini 4 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.240
 other 9 years where used 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.610
 famous firm identified 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.680
 models 1 150 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.960
 Here, but I do not guarantee that I mean 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 principle you can put 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.730
 any 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.129
 meters 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.409
 here you can adapt this not 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.499
 that 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.859
 the fact is that in the rotor 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 on made by him 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.889
 2 blows 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.669
 Copach aid and country located 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.589
 90 degrees 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.599
 I just took off 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 not fired magnet revolutions 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.139
 from one to the measurement of grain 90 degrees and 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.399
 put him back 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.399
 that's basically eset 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.229
 true 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.599
 although 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.599
 Mr. N 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:37.770
 but
