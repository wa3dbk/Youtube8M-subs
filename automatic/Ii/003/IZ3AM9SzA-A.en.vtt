power<00:00:23.490> or<00:00:23.910> let's<00:00:24.660> say<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.380> reverse

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
power or let's say you put it in reverse

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
power or let's say you put it in reverse
or<00:00:26.189> drive<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> big<00:00:27.240> clunking

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
or drive and you get a big clunking

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.679 
or drive and you get a big clunking
sound<00:00:28.609> well<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.330> something<00:00:30.599> here

other words if you put it in P R in d3

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
other words if you put it in P R in d3
201<00:01:12.200> then<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.159> moving

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
201 then this here is going to be moving

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
201 then this here is going to be moving
back<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.939> forth<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.200> some

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
back and forth that will make up some

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
back and forth that will make up some
switches<00:01:16.950> inside<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.150> inside<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
switches inside here and inside this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
transmission control module now we're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.149 
transmission control module now we're
going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.200> into<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.920> bit

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
going to get into this a little bit

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
going to get into this a little bit
deeper<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.060> we're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.780> over

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
deeper and we're going to go look over

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.920 
deeper and we're going to go look over
the<00:01:31.140> electrical<00:01:31.590> wiring<00:01:31.829> diagrams<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.930> we're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the electrical wiring diagrams and we're

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.359 
the electrical wiring diagrams and we're
going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> diagnose<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.130> bit

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
going to diagnose this a little bit

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
going to diagnose this a little bit
right<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.680> my<00:01:38.479> check<00:01:39.479> engine<00:01:39.689> light<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> off

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
right now my check engine light is off

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.149 
right now my check engine light is off
so<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.759> doing<00:01:42.329> okay<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:44.040> know

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
so it's doing okay right now you know

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
so it's doing okay right now you know
with<00:01:44.340> me<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> time<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.290> things

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
with me most of the time I get things

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
with me most of the time I get things
they're<00:01:46.770> always<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> minute<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> figured

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
they're always in a minute but I figured

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
they're always in a minute but I figured
it'd<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> good<00:01:49.500> chance<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.189> show<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.490> guys

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it'd be a good chance to show you guys

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.080 
it'd be a good chance to show you guys
how<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.000> troubleshoot<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> we're<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> do

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
how to troubleshoot so we're going to do

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
how to troubleshoot so we're going to do
it's<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> few<00:01:54.540> videos<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> just

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's like a few videos here but I just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's like a few videos here but I just
want<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> pointed<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> show

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
want to pointed this out to you and show

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
want to pointed this out to you and show
you<00:01:58.500> where<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.340> also<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> way

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you where this is at also by the way

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.300 
you where this is at also by the way
this<00:02:01.590> also<00:02:02.159> has<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.259> has<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> reverse<00:02:04.619> backup

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this also has the has the reverse backup

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
this also has the has the reverse backup
lights<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.060> switch<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.509> built<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:06.930> for

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
lights the switch is built in here for

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.119 
lights the switch is built in here for
that<00:02:07.409> also

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that also

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.510 
that also
and<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:09.420> also<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> port<00:02:10.410> neutral<00:02:11.009> position

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and it also has a port neutral position

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.480 
and it also has a port neutral position
switch<00:02:11.700> built<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
switch built in here so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.790 
switch built in here so
it<00:02:13.580> only<00:02:13.700> allows<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.120> car<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.750> start<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.230> park

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it only allows the car to start in park

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.140 
it only allows the car to start in park
or<00:02:16.070> neutral<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.440> here<00:02:18.710> little

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
or neutral so this here this here little

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.490 
or neutral so this here this here little
assembly<00:02:20.150> right<00:02:20.300> here<00:02:20.540> has<00:02:20.720> quite<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.200> few

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
assembly right here has quite a few

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.220 
assembly right here has quite a few
switch<00:02:21.980> contacts<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.960> ones<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
switch contacts in here so the ones that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.870 
switch contacts in here so the ones that
we're<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.710> be<00:02:24.800> looking<00:02:25.130> at<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
we're going to be looking at is for the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.240 
we're going to be looking at is for the
four<00:02:26.090> switches<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.900> goes<00:02:27.140> sends<00:02:27.890> signals

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
four switches that goes sends signals

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.490 
four switches that goes sends signals
back<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.700> data<00:02:28.910> data<00:02:29.660> lines<00:02:29.930> back<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
back to the data data lines back to the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.370 
back to the data data lines back to the
TCM<00:02:31.120> okay<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.300> let's<00:02:32.660> go<00:02:32.780> ahead<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.110> get<00:02:33.230> you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
TCM okay for let's go ahead and get you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.710 
TCM okay for let's go ahead and get you
a<00:02:33.410> shot<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> code<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.420> here

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
a shot so you can see the code on here

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.400 
a shot so you can see the code on here
and<00:02:35.890> then<00:02:36.890> after<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.850> do<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:38.480> we'll

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
and then after we do that then we'll

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.380 
and then after we do that then we'll
probably<00:02:39.620> close<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.130> video<00:02:40.340> out<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.030> we'll

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
probably close this video out and we'll

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.540 
probably close this video out and we'll
start<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.050> get<00:02:42.200> into<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.650> Diagnostics

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
start on it and get into the Diagnostics

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.610 
start on it and get into the Diagnostics
as<00:02:43.700> far<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> electrical<00:02:44.990> troubleshooting

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
as far as a electrical troubleshooting

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.250 
as far as a electrical troubleshooting
on<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:45.920> okay<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.550> next<00:02:47.150> shot<00:02:47.480> let's<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:47.900> look<00:02:48.110> at

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
on it okay so next shot let's go look at

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.940 
on it okay so next shot let's go look at
the<00:02:48.410> scanner<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.220> see<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.640> got<00:02:50.950> alright

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the scanner and see what we got alright

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.350 
the scanner and see what we got alright
guys<00:02:52.100> let's<00:02:52.160> take<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.670> look<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> code<00:02:53.330> here

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
guys let's take a look at the code here

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.900 
guys let's take a look at the code here
to<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:54.080> what<00:02:54.260> we're<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.620> get<00:02:54.910> I've

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
to see what we're going to get I've

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.610 
to see what we're going to get I've
already<00:02:56.240> looked<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:56.720> before<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.350> want

to show you guys what it's going to be
okay<00:03:02.110> take<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> few<00:03:03.380> seconds<00:03:03.890> here<00:03:04.100> for<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.550> to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
okay take a few seconds here for it to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.600 
okay take a few seconds here for it to
retrieve<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.720> code<00:03:05.960> all<00:03:06.320> codes<00:03:09.400> alright<00:03:10.400> as

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
retrieve the code all codes alright as

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.070 
retrieve the code all codes alright as
you<00:03:10.790> can<00:03:10.970> see<00:03:11.240> this<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> p0<00:03:12.940> 705

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
the wiring diagram on this to see how

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.670 
the wiring diagram on this to see how
this<00:04:06.590> thing<00:04:06.890> works<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:08.380> before<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.470> get<00:04:09.620> into

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
this thing works but before we get into

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.699 
this thing works but before we get into
that<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.910> next<00:04:10.970> videos<00:04:11.570> right<00:04:12.410> now<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.620> just

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
that in the next videos right now I just

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.890 
that in the next videos right now I just
want<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.100> say<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.490> this<00:04:13.670> switch<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.330> really

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
want to say that this switch is a really

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.530 
want to say that this switch is a really
big<00:04:15.110> problem<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.800> these<00:04:16.040> here<00:04:16.280> ring<00:04:16.549> Suzuki

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
big problem on these here ring Suzuki

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.560 
big problem on these here ring Suzuki
forensics<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.320> other<00:04:18.440> makes<00:04:18.739> there<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.180> I

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
forensics and other makes there so I

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.969 
forensics and other makes there so I
figured<00:04:21.080> this<00:04:21.170> would<00:04:21.290> be<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.440> good<00:04:21.650> video<00:04:21.799> for

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
figured this would be a good video for

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.150 
figured this would be a good video for
you<00:04:22.310> guys<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.850> see<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:24.410> know<00:04:24.530> about<00:04:24.770> how<00:04:24.979> this

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
you guys to see you know about how this

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.180 
you guys to see you know about how this
thing<00:04:25.400> works

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
thing works

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.700 
thing works
how<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.460> troubleshoot<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:28.320> here<00:04:28.680> I

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
how to troubleshoot it and this here I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.440 
how to troubleshoot it and this here I
just<00:04:28.860> want<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.280> start<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.670> off<00:04:29.820> here<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.300> just

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
just want to start you off here and just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.420 
just want to start you off here and just
take<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.600> look<00:04:30.930> at<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.170> code<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.100> see

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
take a look at this code so we can see

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.460 
take a look at this code so we can see
where<00:04:33.300> we<00:04:33.480> got<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.840> go<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.170> it

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
where we got to go with it

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.290 
where we got to go with it
now<00:04:34.770> what<00:04:34.950> happens<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.790> when<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.060> thing

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
now what happens is that when this thing

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.110 
now what happens is that when this thing
gets<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.750> code<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.890> as<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.550> mentioned<00:04:39.000> it

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
gets this code the as I mentioned it

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.080 
gets this code the as I mentioned it
will<00:04:39.240> automatically<00:04:39.900> set<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.920> code<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.670> it

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
will automatically set the code and it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.730 
will automatically set the code and it
will<00:04:42.210> bring<00:04:42.390> on<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> check<00:04:42.900> engine<00:04:43.140> light<00:04:43.470> you

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
will bring on the check engine light you

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.500 
will bring on the check engine light you
don't<00:04:43.890> have<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.130> go<00:04:44.250> through<00:04:44.550> two<00:04:45.150> or<00:04:45.300> three

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
don't have to go through two or three

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.020 
don't have to go through two or three
drive<00:04:45.870> cycles<00:04:46.440> for<00:04:46.560> this<00:04:46.740> thing's<00:04:47.010> set<00:04:47.370> then

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
drive cycles for this thing's set then

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.760 
drive cycles for this thing's set then
what<00:04:48.300> happened<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.990> transmission<00:04:49.500> will

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
what happened is the transmission will

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.070 
what happened is the transmission will
go<00:04:49.920> into<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.250> limp<00:04:50.610> mode<00:04:50.850> basically<00:04:51.570> that's

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
go into a limp mode basically that's

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.070 
go into a limp mode basically that's
where<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:54.120> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.420> default<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.900> a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
where the it's going to default to a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.260 
where the it's going to default to a
another<00:04:55.800> program<00:04:56.340> ignoring<00:04:56.910> some<00:04:57.120> of<00:04:57.150> the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
another program ignoring some of the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.290 
another program ignoring some of the
sensors<00:04:57.750> out<00:04:57.930> there<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.590> TCM<00:04:59.460> that's

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
sensors out there that the TCM that's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.750 
sensors out there that the TCM that's
the<00:05:00.450> transmission<00:05:01.110> control<00:05:01.290> module<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:02.250> going

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
the transmission control module is going

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.700 
the transmission control module is going
to<00:05:03.030> ignore<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:03.810> going<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.050> be<00:05:04.200> running<00:05:04.560> on

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
to ignore so it's going to be running on

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.740 
to ignore so it's going to be running on
a<00:05:04.740> default<00:05:05.280> program<00:05:05.790> pretty<00:05:06.330> much<00:05:06.510> what's

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
a default program pretty much what's

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.380 
a default program pretty much what's
happening<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.590> your<00:05:08.100> car<00:05:08.610> will<00:05:09.120> start

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
happening is that your car will start

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
happening is that your car will start
off<00:05:09.570> in<00:05:09.780> fourth<00:05:10.110> gear<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:11.570> trust<00:05:12.570> me<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:13.230> will

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
off in fourth gear and trust me you will

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.950 
off in fourth gear and trust me you will
know<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:14.010> when<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:15.030> condition<00:05:15.270> happens

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
know that when this condition happens

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.770 
know that when this condition happens
your<00:05:16.110> transmission<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:16.950> going<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.160> be<00:05:17.220> really

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
your transmission is going to be really

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.060 
your transmission is going to be really
sluggish<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.990> car's<00:05:19.260> not<00:05:19.530> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:19.920> any

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
sluggish the car's not going to have any

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.490 
sluggish the car's not going to have any
power<00:05:20.370> some<00:05:21.360> other<00:05:21.510> symptoms<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.350> might

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
power some other symptoms that you might

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.980 
power some other symptoms that you might
have<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:22.980> if<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.280> go<00:05:23.460> into<00:05:23.880> say<00:05:24.240> reverse<00:05:24.660> or

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
have that if you go into say reverse or

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.020 
have that if you go into say reverse or
in<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.320> drive<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:26.190> may<00:05:26.370> experience<00:05:26.760> a

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
in the drive you may experience a

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.270 
in the drive you may experience a
clunking<00:05:27.600> sound<00:05:27.900> reason<00:05:28.710> for<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:28.950> is<00:05:29.130> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
clunking sound reason for that is the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.950 
clunking sound reason for that is the
line<00:05:29.520> pressure<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.060> being<00:05:30.240> driven<00:05:30.480> up<00:05:30.690> higher

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
line pressure is being driven up higher

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.290 
line pressure is being driven up higher
also<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:32.340> anyway<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.610> just<00:05:32.670> want<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.120> show<00:05:33.240> you

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
also so anyway I just want to show you

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200 
also so anyway I just want to show you
guys<00:05:33.570> this<00:05:33.960> here<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.530> then<00:05:34.920> in<00:05:35.070> videos<00:05:35.970> that's

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
guys this here and then in videos that's

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.880 
guys this here and then in videos that's
coming<00:05:36.480> up<00:05:36.600> we're<00:05:37.140> going<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.350> start<00:05:37.590> doing<00:05:37.740> a

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
coming up we're going to start doing a

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.980 
coming up we're going to start doing a
little<00:05:37.980> diagnosis<00:05:38.730> I've<00:05:39.180> already<00:05:39.510> got<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:39.690> rain

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
little diagnosis I've already got a rain

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.530 
little diagnosis I've already got a rain
sensor<00:05:40.350> switch<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.190> not<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.550> expensive<00:05:41.820> so

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
sensor switch it's not that expensive so

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.750 
sensor switch it's not that expensive so
in<00:05:42.630> about<00:05:42.810> 30<00:05:43.080> bucks<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:44.040> it's<00:05:44.400> more<00:05:44.610> than

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
in about 30 bucks so it's more than

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.159 
in about 30 bucks so it's more than
likely<00:05:45.030> that's<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.570> problem

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
likely that's the problem

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.500 
likely that's the problem
but<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:46.800> instead<00:05:47.250> of<00:05:47.340> us<00:05:47.490> just<00:05:47.520> changing<00:05:48.390> it

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
but for instead of us just changing it
