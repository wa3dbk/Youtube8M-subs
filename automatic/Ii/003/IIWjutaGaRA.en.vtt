would<00:03:56.700> actually<00:03:57.440> push<00:03:58.440> very<00:03:58.709> hard<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.280> able

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
would actually push very hard to be able

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.420 
would actually push very hard to be able
to<00:03:59.490> show<00:03:59.700> some<00:04:00.660> very<00:04:01.260> early<00:04:01.709> alpha<00:04:02.160> footage

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
to show some very early alpha footage

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.000 
to show some very early alpha footage
even<00:04:03.060> if<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.330> wasn't<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:03.870> rendered<00:04:04.800> with

and the fact that they didn't even show

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.190 
and the fact that they didn't even show
any<00:04:58.410> gameplay<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:59.160> they<00:04:59.430> just<00:04:59.670> showed<00:04:59.910> in<00:05:00.630> in

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
any gameplay that they just showed in in

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.920 
any gameplay that they just showed in in
engine<00:05:01.950> footage<00:05:02.400> again<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.940> air<00:05:03.300> quotes<00:05:03.720> are

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
engine footage again the air quotes are

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.780 
engine footage again the air quotes are
they<00:05:04.590> surround<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.790> whole<00:05:06.200> trailer<00:05:07.790> it

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
they surround this whole trailer it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.390 
they surround this whole trailer it
makes<00:05:09.450> me<00:05:09.660> very<00:05:09.690> concerned<00:05:10.350> because<00:05:10.890> it's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
makes me very concerned because it's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.950 
makes me very concerned because it's
really<00:05:13.130> based<00:05:14.130> on<00:05:14.370> battlefield<00:05:14.940> 4<00:05:15.270> based<00:05:15.690> on

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
really based on battlefield 4 based on

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.110 
really based on battlefield 4 based on
everything<00:05:16.830> they've<00:05:17.250> done<00:05:17.310> even<00:05:17.670> battlefield

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
everything they've done even battlefield

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.730 
everything they've done even battlefield
hardline<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.960> looks<00:05:19.140> exactly<00:05:19.500> like

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
hardline that looks exactly like

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.160 
hardline that looks exactly like
Battlefield<00:05:20.640> 4<00:05:20.880> except<00:05:21.330> with<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.480> Taser<00:05:21.840> and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
Battlefield 4 except with a Taser and

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.540 
Battlefield 4 except with a Taser and
based<00:05:22.890> in<00:05:23.100> Omaha<00:05:23.550> Nebraska<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:25.370> find<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.520> very

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
based in Omaha Nebraska I find it very

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.350 
based in Omaha Nebraska I find it very
hard<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.300> take<00:05:27.660> battlefront<00:05:28.350> seriously<00:05:29.360> and

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
hard to take battlefront seriously and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.450 
hard to take battlefront seriously and
as<00:05:30.990> much<00:05:31.140> as<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.440> would<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:31.950> believe<00:05:32.280> that

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
as much as I would like to believe that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.560 
as much as I would like to believe that
this<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:33.030> going<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.360> be<00:05:33.540> an<00:05:33.800> amazing<00:05:34.800> game

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
this is going to be an amazing game

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.860 
this is going to be an amazing game
based<00:05:36.570> on<00:05:36.900> dices<00:05:37.560> history<00:05:38.060> based<00:05:39.060> on<00:05:39.330> EA's

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
based on dices history based on EA's

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.659 
based on dices history based on EA's
history<00:05:40.590> more<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:42.320> find<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.560> very<00:05:43.770> hard<00:05:44.520> to

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
history more so I find it very hard to

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.240 
history more so I find it very hard to
be<00:05:44.850> excited<00:05:45.300> for<00:05:45.450> this<00:05:45.570> game<00:05:45.660> and<00:05:46.250> everyone

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
