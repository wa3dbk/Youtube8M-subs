00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello youtube here is just a video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 Today I want an alibi part again 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.300
 So before the collection for the park 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.370
 is suddenly in the video position 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 I 'll catch you a dvds ten before we catch you 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 with helsing to prof and last time 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
 had the normal series in the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.980
 collector's edition and now you go with it 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 the opera worker yes that is the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.640
 Anime series I believe that on the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.849
 other based the case brutal but 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 I think the series is simply citizens and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.520
 that is so nicely done that way 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:40.110
 hardcover and so stock very noble 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 Unfortunately, unfortunately , the series is made 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 not yet completed was over a resp 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 srg has gone bankrupt 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.610
 I hope someday someone will 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:57.449
 would continue because it's real 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.850
 awesome if the second box dvd too 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 not so elegantly limited again 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 Pad was that envelope from me 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.780
 as a bit broken so here this one 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.430
 Foil hits would have been the same in the past 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 probably again asked these 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.220
 envelopes here are novels and if 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.799
 So you google harrys mode 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 harrys word I do not blind 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 even a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 then comes here on deck without any is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.509
 the load and then you go on it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.159
 roman and then he has every size I 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.750
 it knows brussels but that is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 there you get every cover asks him 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 Best you get here and there you will 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.439
 already help for what oil dipped 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 There are three hopes I can recognize 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.020
 So that's what annoyed me so much 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 I have any dvd published dirt 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 I 'm in traffic 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.030
 it's finally on but if you are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.060
 yes not only continue 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.579
 been published and the last 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 dvd here it 's just that the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.140
 Nazis want to conquer the world so dead 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.800
 Nazi vampire one that I believe here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.230
 or something 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 I am now no longer safe and 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.430
 then grab England and that so cool 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.740
 So I found that we have with 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.600
 the series better than the viva series so 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.770
 the series on ebay but this is good too 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.830
 but that was already very good 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.200
 to a complete series of new cars 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.610
 mhkw the little superstars i have 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.380
 always thought kickers or what was that 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.150
 And that's not what it is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.710
 other things are up here yes what's called 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.270
 this sport gymnastics rhythm athlete 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.350
 nice series i believe it over elly 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.790
 Girls see if I found the earlier so 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.430
 good and it's my childhood 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 therefore always bought is the 9 10 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 Partial series open end I believe 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.970
 not yet finished because he has one 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.180
 open end so it was definitely 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.820
 but I liked it so much 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.310
 buy I think is of rubber 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.170
 medicine break without kennedy to nico 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.860
 tail call so you can not buy 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.020
 a nice series actually exists 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.200
 Of course better series but that is 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.810
 also with good classics the georgi 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:21.420
 kerry does not even know then come 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.530
 the gates are nothing that is one I know 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.440
 not at all that is a series in 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.760
 four-part uva 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.500
 I looked at her, that was her 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.260
 first I do not know how the first 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 I have a look and I do not know 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.900
 whether the dvd is all connected to the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.700
 they are the same contaminated and the world 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 you can only live under the earth 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
 the cities are and rtl had and then 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.200
 Is there a laboratory over the world there 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.100
 this professor in it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:53.760
 what was the name of the doctor doctor? 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.500
 europe I think yes then comes 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.300
 boy and girl's girl but 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.430
 no human but such a being of 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.050
 marxloh important to him that transforms what 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:09.000
 that man wishes and yes he was 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.290
 very nice but we have not already 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.959
 I have seen to the other 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.730
 dvds too alisa i do not know in the 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.900
 chronological series like the looked 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.539
 I have to be because I do not see a number of me 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.350
 not yet looked at where is already one 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.990
 nice series is a bit older but nice 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.520
 and i have to say the draftsman too 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.520
 glock is also in a good mood 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.300
 It can be sugar if obama 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.590
 sugar daughter continue because the did it 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.849
 And he has the series here too 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.280
 I still value those back then 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.770
 two like to cook not tanja at first 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.389
 shock and the princess the series off 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.479
 someone likes to know completely 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.919
 not always explained then 2 and yes that 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.479
 has also made the draftsman and yes times 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.889
 look like this, I even have the 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.970
 others will give it a look 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.740
 but I have 489 well now 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.400
 Ultimately, it's already ten minutes 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.490
 piece of high school 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:24.680
 i like the anime i just like cool 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.680
 yes it may be that I have so many and so 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.240
 but that too looks good though 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.490
 I think cool 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.889
 These are zombies and I think so 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.440
 simply cool are twelve episodes 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.490
 Unfortunately, the total output does not have the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.430
 come 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.560
 So understand that second floor though 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.650
 I would not have been nice if those were there 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.240
 been on it while maybe 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.349
 We'll somehow get those too 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.419
 now not so much have the 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.919
 internet watched but anyway i would have 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.539
 Also like to have even had the series 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.130
 when the season comes, yes it is 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.669
 still at the coming of this year in 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.010
 Japan 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.810
 I hope that the series 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.440
 So, a little more action is needed 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.389
 a bit more 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.729
 So I'm kind of seeing her there 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.240
 Do not take a break every few minutes 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.280
 yourself 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.750
 Obama you see I would like 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.000
 see what we have to fight because right 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.380
 But survival is so important 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.759
 the series quite cool and the German 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.669
 I like it very much and the one of the 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.349
 Do you have the monks main partner 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.180
 not just from Rome peas and me 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.050
 Wow thought that does not look but 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.710
 but that works very well 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.470
 So I asked very well indeed 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.870
 a little more expensive but I can anyway 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:41.610
 yes that was my 10 18 place taken 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:43.289
 ten dvds in the park 40 appearances was that 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.020
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.710
 look forward to your comments ratings 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.930
 probably two words again 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.630
 thumb because of the market 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.639
 apparently no animated all 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.479
