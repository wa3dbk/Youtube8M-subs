00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
rust so I had a good look around at

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.520 
rust so I had a good look around at
things<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.840> found<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.140> couple<00:00:49.260> more

things and I found a couple more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
things and I found a couple more
problems<00:00:52.309> there's<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> box<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
problems there's a box of just that

problems there's a box of just that
I'm<00:00:54.570> taking<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> car<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:56.160> the

I'm taking out of the car give the
customer<00:00:58.640> here's<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> pipes<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
customer here's one of the pipes for the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
customer here's one of the pipes for the
heater<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.190> goes<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> heater<00:01:03.539> tap

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
heater that goes from the heater tap

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920 
heater that goes from the heater tap
along<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.070> chassis<00:01:05.460> rail<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> water

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
along the chassis rail up to the water

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.010 
along the chassis rail up to the water
pump<00:01:07.140> basically<00:01:07.820> as<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> quite

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.880 
pump basically as you can see it quite

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.240 

so<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.820> caning<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.830> design

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so I'm caning that and with this design

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.200 
so I'm caning that and with this design
it<00:01:14.430> goes<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.939> 5-8<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it goes from 5-8 which that is to the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
it goes from 5-8 which that is to the
heat<00:01:18.360> attack<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.380> 3/4

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
heat attack which is actually 3/4

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.450 
heat attack which is actually 3/4
fitting<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.210> water<00:01:21.390> pumps<00:01:21.689> 3/4<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.220> by

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
fitting and the water pumps 3/4 so by

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
fitting and the water pumps 3/4 so by
deleting<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.360> saving<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> customer<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

hmm I know what it's boiling point is

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.199 
hmm I know what it's boiling point is
that's<00:03:06.599> just<00:03:06.840> terrible

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
had a hole of 7 psi 5 degrees Celsius so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.250 
had a hole of 7 psi 5 degrees Celsius so
yeah<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.879> was<00:03:21.969> just<00:03:22.030> an<00:03:22.269> easy<00:03:22.450> little<00:03:22.750> the

water pump now and that one how is this
live<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.870> why<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.049> wanted<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.469> take<00:03:56.709> the

all that it was so easy to do the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.280 
all that it was so easy to do the
alternator<00:04:10.090> right<00:04:10.389> now

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
alternator right now

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.740 
alternator right now
we<00:04:12.219> had<00:04:12.340> it'll<00:04:12.609> shoot<00:04:12.730> itself<00:04:13.120> in<00:04:13.269> six<00:04:13.480> months

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
we had it'll shoot itself in six months

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.949 
we had it'll shoot itself in six months
time<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.139> have<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.409> do<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:18.690> those<00:04:19.690> two

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
time and have to do it in those two

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.210 
time and have to do it in those two
pipes<00:04:20.229> there<00:04:20.530> feed<00:04:21.150> coolant<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.659> choke

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
pipes there feed coolant to the choke

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.580 
pipes there feed coolant to the choke
here

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
