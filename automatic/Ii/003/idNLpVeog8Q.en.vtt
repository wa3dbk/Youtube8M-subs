00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.460 
back from that game but you know it's
it's<00:00:25.090> about<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.480> whole<00:00:25.690> team<00:00:26.020> you<00:00:26.230> know<00:00:26.320> we've

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
know we didn't do that but I think

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.760 
know we didn't do that but I think
practice<00:00:31.119> was<00:00:31.330> you<00:00:31.689> know<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.050> attitudes<00:00:32.500> been

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
practice was you know the attitudes been

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.520 
practice was you know the attitudes been
great<00:00:33.720> you<00:00:34.720> know<00:00:34.750> there<00:00:35.140> was<00:00:35.199> enough

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
great you know there was enough

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.080 
great you know there was enough
encouraging<00:00:36.190> things<00:00:36.430> out<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.699> that<00:00:36.820> first

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
encouraging things out of that first

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.750 
encouraging things out of that first
game<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.440> game<00:00:38.620> was<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.860> lot<00:00:39.070> closer<00:00:39.340> with<00:00:39.520> the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
game the game was a lot closer with the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.130 
game the game was a lot closer with the
score<00:00:40.000> indicated<00:00:40.510> I<00:00:40.540> think<00:00:40.750> when<00:00:40.840> you<00:00:40.899> start

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.709 
score indicated I think when you start
talking<00:00:41.320> plays<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:43.030> take<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.329> kicking

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
talking plays and you take the kicking

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.650 
talking plays and you take the kicking
game<00:00:43.750> out<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.590> know<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:45.540> about<00:00:46.540> the

special<00:01:37.929> things<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.619> why<00:01:38.860> not<00:01:39.069> be<00:01:39.670> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
special things you know why not be a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.760 
special things you know why not be a
part<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.300> make<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.810> happen<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.649> know

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
part of that and make it happen you know

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.790 
part of that and make it happen you know
and<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:43.390> kind<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.750> where<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.899> just<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.649> know

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
and that's kind of where I just you know

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.820 
and that's kind of where I just you know
talk<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.700> coach<00:01:45.880> about<00:01:45.910> it<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.539> he'll<00:01:47.050> win<00:01:47.500> I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
talk to coach about it and he'll win I

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.309 
talk to coach about it and he'll win I
think<00:01:48.580> we<00:01:48.759> as<00:01:48.819> a<00:01:48.880> staff<00:01:49.149> kind<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.599> made<00:01:49.750> talked

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
think we as a staff kind of made talked

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.529 
think we as a staff kind of made talked
about<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.039> mention<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.420> our

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
about that but mention that to our

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.749 
about that but mention that to our
players<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.410> know<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.979> they<00:01:54.280> they

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
players and you know I think they they

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.940 
players and you know I think they they
bought<00:01:55.000> into<00:01:55.209> it<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:55.869> do<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.380> go<00:01:56.590> into<00:01:56.800> a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
bought into it so do you go into a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.399 
bought into it so do you go into a
season<00:01:57.310> opener<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> pretty<00:01:58.209> good<00:01:58.330> idea

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
season opener a pretty good idea

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.690 
season opener a pretty good idea

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
huddle and but we we prepared for

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.460 
huddle and but we we prepared for
because<00:02:22.030> we've<00:02:22.239> seen<00:02:22.569> some<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.200> stuff

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
because we've seen some of that stuff

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.440 
because we've seen some of that stuff
and<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:24.010> far<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.430> practice<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.150> things<00:02:25.330> of

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and as far as practice and things of

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.750 
and as far as practice and things of
that<00:02:25.480> nature<00:02:25.599> how<00:02:26.080> we<00:02:26.140> practice<00:02:26.549> but<00:02:27.549> at<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
that nature how we practice but at the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
that nature how we practice but at the
same<00:02:28.000> time<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.860> different<00:02:30.220> bird

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
same time it's a it's a different bird

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.800 
same time it's a it's a different bird
so<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> speak<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.180> know<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.510> you're<00:02:31.660> going

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so to speak you know that you're going

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.729 
so to speak you know that you're going
to<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> different<00:02:32.079> animals<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.870> its

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
to a different animals so but its

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.710 
to a different animals so but its
principles<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.640> we've<00:02:36.819> seen<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.420> our

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
principles that we've seen from our

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.630 
principles that we've seen from our
offense<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.530> type<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.799> stuff<00:02:38.950> too<00:02:39.370> so

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
offense and that type of stuff too so

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.059 
offense and that type of stuff too so
you<00:02:39.970> know<00:02:40.120> that's<00:02:40.299> from<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.349> schematic

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
you know that's from a schematic

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.660 
you know that's from a schematic
standpoint<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.819> like<00:02:43.209> where<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.599> are<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:44.680> have

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
standpoint I like where we are now have

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.059 
standpoint I like where we are now have
we<00:02:45.819> seen<00:02:46.030> no<00:02:46.420> huddle<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.989> fast<00:02:47.410> tempo<00:02:47.860> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
we seen no huddle and fast tempo and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.160 
we seen no huddle and fast tempo and
that<00:02:48.160> type<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.400> stuff<00:02:48.549> now<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.750> know<00:02:49.870> we

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
that type of stuff now but you know we

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.110 
that type of stuff now but you know we
hopefully<00:02:50.530> with<00:02:51.010> our<00:02:51.160> experience<00:02:51.700> we've<00:02:51.879> seen

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
hopefully with our experience we've seen

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.150 
hopefully with our experience we've seen
it<00:02:52.239> enough<00:02:52.329> you<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:53.440> over<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.709> years<00:02:53.739> that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160
