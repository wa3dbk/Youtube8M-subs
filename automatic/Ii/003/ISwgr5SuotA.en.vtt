00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.130
 hello friends with you project ferrum com and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.350
 I am Sergey Mikhailov 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 today we will talk about samsung 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.990
 galaxy note 4 namely, we will try to find 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.939
 its weakest places thereby 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.860
 try to name five reasons for 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.400
 who should refuse to purchase 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.789
 this device and so the number one reason 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.270
 the price is known 4 laptop in Ukraine today 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.850
 It costs about 800 20 US dollars and this 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.880
 you know not that little money 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.950
 for this amount you can buy yourself barely 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.800
 whether or not any flagship smartphone 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.730
 another manufacturer for example sony 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.809
 xperia z3 ask about 750 green per 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.399
 lenovo wipe z2 pro 580 bucks for lg g 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.480
 pro 2 440 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.760
 and for land plos one at 64 gigabytes 460 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.370
 American presidents in general 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.250
 there are plenty of alternatives I called 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.220
 far from all the second reason not to buy 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.950
 4 but not the highest quality of it 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.259
 Build think many have heard about 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.630
 the existence of some jamb in 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.149
 fitting parts and our apparatus 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.789
 copy is no exception to the rule 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.490
 like many of his relatives of ours 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.190
 specimen there are gaps at the junction 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.380
 some body components are better 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.530
 all this can be seen on its front 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.060
 panels in the area did not happen 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.910
 contact of glass and metal 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.490
 cant up the slit is small but as 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.069
 habitat for sorin it is very 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.039
 will not fit in the most outstanding 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.289
 build quality especially for 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.220
 flagship device reason number 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.800
 Three display devices are known 4 laptops 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.780
 has ultra clear 5 7 inch 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.190
 super amoled screen with brutal 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.560
 viewing angles are also good for this 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.140
 the parameter super amoled matrices and almost none 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.000
 what to compare but this display has 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.990
 and Achilles heel 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 low update rate 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.910
 images precisely because of this annoying 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 trouble look at this screen 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.010
 a long time is not very pleasant 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.390
 you are edited by a surgeon he speaks 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.240
 own experience 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.850
 people with poor vision after an hour 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.400
 work behind this screen and do complain 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.320
 on the pain in the eyes we move on 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 the fourth reason is good 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.770
 think about buying samsung 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.770
 galaxy note 4 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.390
 its dimensions many people choosing for themselves 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.400
 device for everyday 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.070
 use for some reason forget 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.800
 separate the concept of smartphone and phablet 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.380
 the first characteristic of adequate dimensions 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.050
 and the same ergonomics then 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.450
 as for the second, such words are alien but 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.670
 Here you can imagine for example 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.010
 how can you control the device with 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 a screen almost six inches with the help 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.040
 one hand I am not in principle fourth 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.920
 With one hand you can control the laptop but 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.860
 comfort and confidence here speech is not 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.990
 comes to the same situation come to mind 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.780
 when you need to use a smartphone 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.000
 with one-handed grip on the move for example 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.850
 on the way home from the supermarket with 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.310
 heavy bags in hand if in such 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.380
 scripts try to get out of their 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.600
 suppose tight pants so not 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.610
 small device and try to dial 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.450
 number then there is a high probability 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.210
 his drop the final fifth reason 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.910
 don't buy galaxy note 4 serious 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.370
 the relevance of its predecessor which 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.940
 quite possibly last some more 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.250
 years before a new generation of galaxy music became 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.020
 faster than previous 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.840
 got an improved display 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 redesigned design and a whole mountain 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.780
 amenities but then the 3 notes are not so 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.340
 too bad example of his 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.070
 performance is more than enough 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.360
 to run the vast majority 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.550
 modern games from the app store 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.160
 at maximum settings 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.540
 its appearance has no global 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.970
 differences from new 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.890
 because with the exception of metal edging 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.430
 no other in the case 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.440
 fundamental changes 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.109
 and about the same thing didn't happen 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.389
 concerns the mass of other parameters 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.120
 devices in general you have 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.120
 the opportunity to purchase about the same 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.570
 galaxy note 4 but with conditional prefix 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.320
 lite 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.660
 at the same time saving a lot 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.930
 280 bucks as for me a good option 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.600
 You heard 5 reasons why not 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.060
 buy samsung galaxy note 4 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.910
