00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.000
 Today Alice has an appointment at ABC Clinic. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Alice wants to get rid of her sunken cheeks. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.500
 She thinks that this makes her look older and it is important for her to look good. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.900
 Also because of daily contact with its customers. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.600
 Look as I look in your face like that, I see right in your face and here under the cheekbone 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 quite a bit of volume loss. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.100
 Which gives you a bit of a clear view of your cheekbones and this is a bit of a dent. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 That can actually be done very nicely with a filler. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 So with relatively little effort, we can restore that very nicely, nicely for you. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.800
 And when I look at it myself and I do so ... Then I think: this is what I mean! 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 You stand in front of the mirror every day to push things up a bit 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 Injectable doctor Joost Kroon does this with a liquid facelift. 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 This facelift has the same effect as a surgical facelift, but with injectables. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 Are you a little nervous? No, I'm looking forward to it. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.400
 It is the ideal total treatment for the aged face. 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.900
 I'm going to treat you with a product, with a filler that stimulates your own collagen production. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It also gives a lot of volume. So with very few products you can restore the volume that has ever been. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 First it is indicated at which places of both cheeks the injectables should be placed. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.600
 The amount of injectables and therefore also the duration of this treatment can differ per person, because the diagnosis is different for everyone. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 This is always extensively discussed in advance with the treated doctor. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600
 You really don't feel this at all here. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.800
 The result for a liquid facelift lasts more than a year and is therefore not permanent. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 Then Alice should return for a repeat treatment. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.100
 For which less filler will be needed. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.100
 But for the time being Elis is going home with a satisfied result. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 It is immediately nicer. Is not it? Super! 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.900
 Very good. 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.500
 After six weeks Alice is back in the ABC Clinic for a check-up. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.700
 How is she now? 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.200
 It is going very well and there were no spots of the punctures 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.700
 No blood shedding, I have not been red and I could go to work. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 Everyone says you look rested. Or is your hair different? 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400
 So I actually think that's super positive. 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.500
 I know I could have gotten rid of it so quickly. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 I had my cheeks back in 20 minutes, then I would have done it years earlier.
