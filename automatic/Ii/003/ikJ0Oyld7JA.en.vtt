cap to the core and all the pieces are
new<00:00:48.239> compared<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> other<00:00:49.730> cubes<00:00:50.730> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
new compared to all the other cubes that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
new compared to all the other cubes that
are<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> market<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.020> yeah<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.039> gotta

are on the market and yeah i just gotta
disassemble<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.120> cube<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.719> show<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> all

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
disassemble the cube and show you all

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
disassemble the cube and show you all
the<00:00:56.250> pieces<00:00:58.010> okay<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> color

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the pieces okay so this is the color

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
the pieces okay so this is the color
yeah<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.010> looks<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.280> different<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.210> like

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
yeah it looks really different to like

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
yeah it looks really different to like
all<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.470> cubes<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
all the other cubes yeah it has this

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
all the other cubes yeah it has this
ball<00:01:06.600> caught<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> middle<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.619> yeah

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
ball caught in the middle yeah and yeah

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
ball caught in the middle yeah and yeah
he<00:01:10.920> also<00:01:11.010> spoke<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> middle<00:01:11.880> well<00:01:12.240> these

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
he also spoke on the middle well these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.710 
he also spoke on the middle well these
centerpieces<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.860> attached<00:01:14.760> yeah<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> think

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
centerpieces are attached yeah I think

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.859 
centerpieces are attached yeah I think
it<00:01:15.960> looks<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.680> weird<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.509> because<00:01:18.509> yeah

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it looks with weird to you because yeah

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
it looks with weird to you because yeah
it's<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.200> new<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.770> basically<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> code

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it's all new but basically what the code

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's all new but basically what the code
does<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.909> show<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
does you will see when I show you the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.679 
does you will see when I show you the
edges<00:01:25.409> okay<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> edge<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
edges okay so this is the edge it is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.160 
edges okay so this is the edge it is
like<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> top<00:01:31.920> it'll<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.369> top<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.780> these

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like the top it'll on top and then these

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.670 
like the top it'll on top and then these
wings<00:01:34.650> underneath<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.630> yeah<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
wings underneath it yeah and when you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.429 
wings underneath it yeah and when you
put<00:01:37.890> edge<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.360> core<00:01:40.070> like<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.960> yeah<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
put edge in the core like this yeah the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
put edge in the core like this yeah the
wings<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.399> under<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> tender<00:01:45.689> piece<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
wings are under the tender piece and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.670 
wings are under the tender piece and
then<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> torpedo<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.579> under<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.840> shells

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
then to torpedo is under these shells

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.940 
then to torpedo is under these shells
from<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.909> ball<00:01:51.090> core<00:01:51.390> yeah<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> loosen

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
from the ball core yeah you can loosen

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
from the ball core yeah you can loosen
the<00:01:53.189> cube<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.540> with

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the cube as much as you want it with

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.709 
the cube as much as you want it with
this<00:01:54.899> system<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.740> won't<00:01:56.219> pop<00:01:56.460> at<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.759> okay<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
this system it won't pop at all okay so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.580 
this system it won't pop at all okay so
this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> corner<00:01:59.360> it<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> big<00:02:00.990> Pete's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this is a corner it is this big Pete's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.910 
this is a corner it is this big Pete's
on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> bottom<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.719> cut<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.380> at

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
on the bottom and then it's cut off at

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.419 
on the bottom and then it's cut off at
the<00:02:04.979> corners<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.000> Sequoia<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.049> this

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
the corners of Sequoia here like this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.449 
the corners of Sequoia here like this
like<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> diane<00:02:08.910> cube<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.539> yeah<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
like a diane cube but yeah just with a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.490 
like a diane cube but yeah just with a
bit<00:02:11.520> less<00:02:11.670> plastic<00:02:12.209> less<00:02:12.750> plastic

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
bit less plastic less plastic

another<00:02:18.120> thing<00:02:18.300> about<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.600> colonize<00:02:18.960> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
another thing about to colonize that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.300 
another thing about to colonize that
it's<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.620> unstable<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:22.650> like

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
it's like unstable it's like like like

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.720 
it's like unstable it's like like like
this<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.040> these<00:02:26.280> three<00:02:26.520> pieces

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
this like it's like these three pieces

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.570 
this like it's like these three pieces
and<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.420> stick<00:02:28.230> them<00:02:28.440> together<00:02:28.620> we're

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and you can stick them together we're
