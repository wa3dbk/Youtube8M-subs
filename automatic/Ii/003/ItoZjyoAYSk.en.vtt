00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
came out of their classes and that was a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
came out of their classes and that was a
weird<00:01:44.399> feeling<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.000> didn't<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.450> fit<00:01:46.170> figure

you're currently watching at 4701 TDM by
the<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.020> thought<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.710> quite<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the way this is I thought it was quite a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
the way this is I thought it was quite a
good<00:02:05.340> gameplay<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.540> use<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> Osprey

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
good gameplay but I do use the Osprey

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
good gameplay but I do use the Osprey
gunner<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.740> she<00:02:07.860> saw<00:02:08.069> right<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.119> well

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
gunner as she saw right there but well

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.199 
gunner as she saw right there but well
it's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.200> 47<00:02:10.770> k<00:02:10.920> dt<00:02:11.220> DM<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.700> i<00:02:11.730> thought<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> guys

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it's a 47 k dt DM so i thought you guys

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's a 47 k dt DM so i thought you guys
might<00:02:12.510> enjoy<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
might enjoy it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
might enjoy it
and<00:02:13.769> well<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.519> hope<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:14.939> what<00:02:15.180> you're<00:02:15.329> doing

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and well I hope that's what you're doing

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.839 
and well I hope that's what you're doing
right<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.989> let's<00:02:16.260> put<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.560> way<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
right now let's put it that way but and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.270 
right now let's put it that way but and
obviously<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.659> think<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.409> wasn't<00:02:19.829> really<00:02:19.950> close

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
obviously I think I wasn't really close

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.399 
obviously I think I wasn't really close
to<00:02:20.430> any<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:21.209> assault<00:02:21.629> Moab<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> would

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
to any like assault Moab but I would

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.309 
to any like assault Moab but I would
have<00:02:22.530> loved<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.890> go<00:02:23.250> 45<00:02:23.939> know<00:02:24.239> instead<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.629> 47

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
have loved to go 45 know instead of 47

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.929 
have loved to go 45 know instead of 47
and<00:02:25.409> one<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.799> something<00:02:26.220> because<00:02:26.370> they're<00:02:26.730> so

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
and one or something because they're so

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.550 
and one or something because they're so
there's<00:02:27.329> something<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> flawless<00:02:28.170> game

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
there's something to the flawless game

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.349 
there's something to the flawless game
right<00:02:28.829> but<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.760> didn't<00:02:29.970> happen<00:02:30.090> because

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
right but that didn't happen because

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.780 
right but that didn't happen because
that<00:02:30.659> guy<00:02:30.780> shot<00:02:31.079> me<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.349> back<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.220> maybe<00:02:32.670> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that guy shot me in the back but maybe I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.429 
that guy shot me in the back but maybe I
deserve<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.299> die<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.840> ran<00:02:34.019> out<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
deserve to die because I ran out in the

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.979 
deserve to die because I ran out in the
open<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:35.250> uh<00:02:35.280> yeah<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.420> another<00:02:36.840> one

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
subscribed for quite a while since the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.229 
subscribed for quite a while since the
black<00:02:46.260> ops<00:02:46.500> days<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.980> play<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> lot<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.909> TDM

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
black ops days I play a lot of TDM

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.759 
black ops days I play a lot of TDM
because<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> loved<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.109> because<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
because I loved it because the the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.680 
because I loved it because the the
spawns<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:50.760> could<00:02:50.940> manipulate<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
spawns you can you could manipulate the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
spawns you can you could manipulate the
spawns<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.319> they<00:02:52.829> were<00:02:52.889> predictable<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.639> in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
spawns and they were predictable but in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.250 
spawns and they were predictable but in
this<00:02:53.909> game<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.329> quite<00:02:54.540> hard<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.840> predict

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
this game it's quite hard to predict

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.680 
this game it's quite hard to predict
response<00:02:55.560> but<00:02:56.549> I'm<00:02:56.790> getting<00:02:57.090> used<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.480> i'm

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
response but I'm getting used to it i'm

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.899

bit<00:03:05.220> more<00:03:05.430> difficult<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.090> just

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
bit more difficult but it's just

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.390
