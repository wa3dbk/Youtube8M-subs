00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
was doing a campaign put plan on a sub

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.890 
was doing a campaign put plan on a sub
box<00:00:26.740> with<00:00:26.950> graffiti<00:00:27.340> everywhere<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.810> was

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
box with graffiti everywhere and it was

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.140 
box with graffiti everywhere and it was
like<00:00:29.050> one<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.439> coolest<00:00:29.770> pictures<00:00:29.980> I<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.640> saw

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
like one of the coolest pictures I I saw

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.540 
like one of the coolest pictures I I saw
when<00:00:31.419> I<00:00:31.509> was<00:00:31.630> younger<00:00:32.160> inspired<00:00:33.160> me<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.430> learn

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
when I was younger inspired me to learn

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.430 
when I was younger inspired me to learn
it<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.940> lot<00:00:34.360> of<00:00:34.450> people<00:00:34.660> who<00:00:34.720> learn<00:00:34.900> can<00:00:35.230> can't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
it a lot of people who learn can can't

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.960 
it a lot of people who learn can can't
put<00:00:35.590> plants<00:00:35.800> on<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.010> bank<00:00:36.280> just<00:00:36.460> because<00:00:36.700> it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
put plants on a bank just because it's

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.880 
put plants on a bank just because it's
less<00:00:37.150> dangerous<00:00:37.360> but<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.200> me<00:00:38.350> it's<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.680> little

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
less dangerous but to me it's a little

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.470 
less dangerous but to me it's a little
harder<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.310> a<00:00:39.340> bank<00:00:39.579> just<00:00:39.730> because<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
harder on a bank just because the

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.000 
harder on a bank just because the
momentum<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.170> you<00:00:41.320> having<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.620> pick<00:00:41.829> up<00:00:41.920> your

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
momentum of you having to pick up your

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.380 
momentum of you having to pick up your
bike<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.460> little<00:00:42.579> more<00:00:42.760> difficult<00:00:43.239> than<00:00:43.270> a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
bike is a little more difficult than a

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.750 
bike is a little more difficult than a
quarter<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.990> quarter<00:00:44.440> just<00:00:44.830> kind<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.130> swings<00:00:45.460> up

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
quarter a quarter just kind of swings up

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.640 
quarter a quarter just kind of swings up
and<00:00:45.880> gets<00:00:46.120> into<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.540> tank<00:00:46.990> and<00:00:47.170> footplant<00:00:47.530> a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
and gets into the tank and footplant a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.890 
and gets into the tank and footplant a
lot<00:00:47.770> easier<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.640> scary<00:00:48.940> part<00:00:49.030> on<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.390> quarter

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
lot easier the scary part on a quarter

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.960 
lot easier the scary part on a quarter
is<00:00:50.020> landing<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.920> if<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.280> got<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.520> coping<00:00:51.850> and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
is landing it if you got the coping and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.300 
is landing it if you got the coping and
everything<00:00:52.390> but<00:00:52.630> get<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:53.530> into<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.830> can<00:00:54.070> camp

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
everything but get it into a can camp

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.730 
everything but get it into a can camp
foot<00:00:54.490> plant<00:00:54.700> easier<00:00:55.060> on<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.240> quarter<00:00:55.630> may<00:00:56.590> be<00:00:56.650> a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
foot plant easier on a quarter may be a

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.980 
foot plant easier on a quarter may be a
little<00:00:56.950> harder<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.790> land<00:00:57.970> than<00:00:58.240> a<00:00:58.270> bank<00:00:58.510> when

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
little harder to land than a bank when

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.480 
little harder to land than a bank when
first<00:00:59.200> doing<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.470> camp<00:00:59.680> camp<00:00:59.860> foot<00:01:00.130> plant<00:01:00.340> you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
first doing a camp camp foot plant you

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.460 
first doing a camp camp foot plant you
want<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.790> learn<00:01:01.330> can-can<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.200> can<00:01:02.350> get

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
want to learn can-can so you can get

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.550 
want to learn can-can so you can get
your<00:01:02.590> foot<00:01:02.740> over<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.040> frame<00:01:03.340> comfortably<00:01:04.119> and

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:04.560 
your foot over the frame comfortably and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.320 
your foot over the frame comfortably and
once<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.710> learn<00:01:05.830> can<00:01:06.130> cans<00:01:06.400> it's<00:01:07.000> just<00:01:07.270> a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
once you learn can cans it's just a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.690 
once you learn can cans it's just a
matter<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.770> at<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> right<00:01:09.250> speed<00:01:09.490> to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
matter of going at the right speed to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.210 
matter of going at the right speed to
the<00:01:09.790> deck<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.299> like<00:01:10.689> to<00:01:10.810> go<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> little<00:01:11.229> slow<00:01:11.590> in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
the deck I like to go a little slow in

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
the deck I like to go a little slow in
the<00:01:12.369> beginning<00:01:12.460> because<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:12.880> want<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.180> go

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
the beginning because you want to go

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.660 
the beginning because you want to go
fast<00:01:13.540> for<00:01:13.810> some<00:01:13.960> reason<00:01:14.290> just<00:01:15.159> like<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.520> get

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
fast for some reason just like to get

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.730 
fast for some reason just like to get
over<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.030> coping<00:01:16.330> but<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:16.750> better<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.530> go

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
over the coping but it's better to go

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.140 
over the coping but it's better to go
slow<00:01:17.770> just<00:01:18.070> kind<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.700> same<00:01:18.880> speed

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
slow just kind of like the same speed

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.750 
slow just kind of like the same speed
you<00:01:19.180> would<00:01:19.390> take<00:01:19.600> for<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:20.020> foot<00:01:20.260> jam<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.520> can

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
you would take for a foot jam so you can

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.649 
you would take for a foot jam so you can
keep<00:01:21.880> your<00:01:22.060> body<00:01:22.240> over<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
keep your body over the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.230 
keep your body over the
and<00:01:23.840> still<00:01:24.340> after<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.579> do<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.999> can-can

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and still after you do the can-can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.550 
and still after you do the can-can
you're<00:01:26.689> going<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:26.929> want<00:01:27.109> to<00:01:27.140> get<00:01:27.289> a<00:01:27.319> solid

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
you're going to want to get a solid

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.380 
you're going to want to get a solid
plant<00:01:28.009> on<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.249> ground<00:01:28.490> as<00:01:28.729> close<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.270> the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
plant on the ground as close to the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.270 
plant on the ground as close to the
coping<00:01:29.749> or<00:01:29.929> into<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.649> transition<00:01:31.159> that's

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
coping or into the transition that's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.249 
coping or into the transition that's
possible<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.539> can<00:01:32.659> jump<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.049> in

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
possible just so you can jump back in

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.109 
possible just so you can jump back in
because<00:01:33.740> if<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:33.979> fly<00:01:34.189> out<00:01:34.219> too<00:01:34.520> far<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.909> makes

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
because if you fly out too far it makes

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.669 
because if you fly out too far it makes
it<00:01:35.240> difficult<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.780> get<00:01:36.020> back<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.350> smoothly

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
it difficult to get back in smoothly
