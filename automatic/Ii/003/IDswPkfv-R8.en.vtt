 proceed as follows we go 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.009

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 Once we click there we have 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.790
 problems here these options where 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 let's go where we're not going to go where 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.300
 that we have in size in any 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.430
 medium large size and more than 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.040
 some options and here we're going 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.050
 exactly says exactly and we're going to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.050
 edit the following dimensions 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.479
 1080 pixels and we are going to click on it and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.549

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 google upload us the images of all 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.909
 the images that have that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.179
 feature that we just entered 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.390
 for example they are all 1920 x 1080 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.649
 pixels and so all are is really 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.319
 well if they put the pointer they give 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.100
 realize that everyone in that same quality 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.009
 buoy 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.990

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.190
 at the bottom you have to load 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.690
 for example until the bar in charge and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.580
 that's when the image is in its 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.900
 maximum quality and what we have to 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 do to simply download a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.270
 let's go here I will go to download it 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.090
 where on the desk 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.470
