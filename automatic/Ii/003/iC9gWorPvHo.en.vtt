well in practice talk treat happen all

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139 
well in practice talk treat happen all
the<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.010> David<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.489> difficult<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the time you David how difficult is it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
the time you David how difficult is it
to<00:00:39.210> adjust<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.170> team<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> guy<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.190> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to adjust to a team when a guy like you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
to adjust to a team when a guy like you
would<00:00:41.790> anyone<00:00:42.120> else<00:00:42.239> comes<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
would anyone else comes into for the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760 
would anyone else comes into for the
first<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:44.210> well<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> challenge

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
first time well and that's the challenge

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.090 
first time well and that's the challenge
I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:46.950> any<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.410> trade<00:00:49.410> where

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I think any time you make a trade where

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
I think any time you make a trade where
you<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.460> changes<00:00:51.120> how<00:00:51.270> quickly<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.840> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you have changes how quickly you can

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.209 
you have changes how quickly you can
adapt<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:54.260> from<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.739> I've<00:00:55.920> watched

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
adapt and I think from what I've watched

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.880 
adapt and I think from what I've watched
that<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.449> they're<00:00:57.719> wizards<00:00:58.590> are

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that right now they're wizards are

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
solid defense rebounding getting into

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.929 
solid defense rebounding getting into
the<00:01:48.380> open<00:01:48.680> floor<00:01:48.920> as<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> group<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.670> played

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
the open floor as a group that played

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.609 
the open floor as a group that played
well<00:01:50.149> yo<00:01:50.390> do<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.780> think<00:01:50.990> Ronnie's<00:01:51.350> playing

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
well yo do you think Ronnie's playing

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.740 
well yo do you think Ronnie's playing
kind<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.159> level<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.970> mean<00:01:53.540> he<00:01:53.630> was

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
kind of at the level that I mean he was

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.929 
kind of at the level that I mean he was
kind<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:53.960> all<00:01:54.430> expecting<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.490> play<00:01:55.610> out<00:01:55.790> before

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
kind of all expecting to play out before

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.700 
kind of all expecting to play out before
the<00:01:56.180> other<00:01:56.330> yeah<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.810> think<00:01:57.110> he's<00:01:57.259> healthy<00:01:57.680> now

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
the other yeah I think he's healthy now

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.249 
the other yeah I think he's healthy now
and<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.280> think<00:01:58.310> he's<00:01:58.549> in<00:01:58.670> great<00:01:58.880> shape<00:01:59.259> and

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and I think he's in great shape and

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.520 
and I think he's in great shape and
again<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.890> big<00:02:01.039> part<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.579> thought<00:02:01.880> was

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
again the big part of that I thought was

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.929 
again the big part of that I thought was
the<00:02:03.530> summer<00:02:03.799> he<00:02:04.009> really<00:02:04.280> couldn't<00:02:04.490> do<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> lot

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
the summer he really couldn't do a lot

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.940 
the summer he really couldn't do a lot
he<00:02:05.360> was<00:02:05.420> still<00:02:05.689> rehabbing<00:02:06.140> his<00:02:06.470> uh<00:02:06.530> his

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
he was still rehabbing his uh his

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.070 
he was still rehabbing his uh his
hamstring<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.269> he<00:02:08.330> wasn't<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.840> great<00:02:08.959> shape

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
hamstring and he wasn't in great shape

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.640 
hamstring and he wasn't in great shape
coming<00:02:09.619> into<00:02:09.830> camp<00:02:10.480> but<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.620> think

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
coming into camp but I think and I think

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.710 
coming into camp but I think and I think
he's<00:02:12.890> confident<00:02:13.370> he<00:02:13.519> knows<00:02:13.700> he's<00:02:13.940> healthy<00:02:14.269> so

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
he's confident he knows he's healthy so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.290 
he's confident he knows he's healthy so
and<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.260> think<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.769> big<00:02:15.920> part<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> also

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and I think that's a big part of it also

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.820 
and I think that's a big part of it also
seems<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:17.810> he's<00:02:17.959> more<00:02:18.140> confident<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.769> a

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
seems like he's more confident with a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.280 
seems like he's more confident with a
shot<00:02:19.100> now<00:02:19.310> he<00:02:19.970> issued<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.360> ball<00:02:20.690> well<00:02:20.870> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
shot now he issued the ball well you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.330 
shot now he issued the ball well you
know<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.250> again<00:02:22.610> he<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.269> see<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.340> in

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
know and again he you can see it in

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.789 
know and again he you can see it in
practice<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:26.060> chart<00:02:26.390> he<00:02:27.110> spent<00:02:27.560> very

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
practice we chart he spent very

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.030 
practice we chart he spent very
consistent<00:02:28.430> with<00:02:28.549> us<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:29.420> his<00:02:29.569> shot<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.920> you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
consistent with us with his shot and you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.590 
consistent with us with his shot and you
can<00:02:31.069> see<00:02:31.370> without<00:02:31.519> hesitation<00:02:32.180> when<00:02:32.450> he's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
can see without hesitation when he's

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.990 
can see without hesitation when he's
open<00:02:32.900> he's<00:02:32.930> shooting<00:02:33.410> he<00:02:34.310> thought<00:02:34.489> about<00:02:34.549> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
open he's shooting he thought about the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520 
open he's shooting he thought about the
miami<00:02:35.450> game<00:02:35.569> they<00:02:35.900> played<00:02:36.110> how's<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> play

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530

miami game they played how's the play
really<00:02:36.709> well<00:02:36.920> against<00:02:37.160> solid<00:02:37.610> without<00:02:38.180> arenas

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
really well against solid without arenas

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.420 
really well against solid without arenas
without<00:02:38.989> wall<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.799> know<00:02:39.920> how<00:02:40.190> are<00:02:40.310> they

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
different than before well they you know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.140 
different than before well they you know
i<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> big<00:02:45.799> thing<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:47.030> know<00:02:47.120> I
