what<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.300> want<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.750> let's<00:05:13.930> do<00:05:14.349> this

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
what I want so let's do this

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.850 
what I want so let's do this
Weber<00:05:15.939> State<00:05:16.210> University<00:05:17.819> and<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:20.500> does<00:05:20.650> that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
Weber State University and it does that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.980 
Weber State University and it does that
pretty<00:05:21.099> good<00:05:21.339> apparently<00:05:22.029> Weber<00:05:22.509> State<00:05:22.810> and

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
pretty good apparently Weber State and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.839 
pretty good apparently Weber State and
Weaver<00:05:23.319> State<00:05:23.500> sound<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> same<00:05:24.099> so<00:05:24.370> I'd<00:05:24.729> have

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
Weaver State sound the same so I'd have

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.929 
Weaver State sound the same so I'd have
to<00:05:24.909> go<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.539> correct<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.620> but<00:05:27.279> overall

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
to go in and correct that but overall

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.850 
to go in and correct that but overall
very<00:05:28.529> good<00:05:29.529> it<00:05:30.310> does<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.639> very<00:05:31.330> decent<00:05:31.689> job<00:05:32.139> with

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
very good it does a very decent job with

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.519 
very good it does a very decent job with
voice<00:05:33.639> recognition<00:05:33.969> there's<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.870> new<00:05:35.169> kind<00:05:35.469> of

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
voice recognition there's a new kind of

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:36.929 
voice recognition there's a new kind of
weighting<00:05:35.979> thinking<00:05:36.460> thing<00:05:36.669> where<00:05:36.819> you've

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 
weighting thinking thing where you've

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.640 
weighting thinking thing where you've
got<00:05:37.060> some<00:05:37.240> ways<00:05:37.419> cars<00:05:37.779> driving<00:05:38.169> around<00:05:38.409> in<00:05:38.529> the

distance<00:06:20.259> it<00:06:20.379> is<00:06:20.500> to<00:06:20.680> get<00:06:20.800> there<00:06:20.949> as<00:06:21.099> well<00:06:21.370> of

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
distance it is to get there as well of

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.909 
distance it is to get there as well of
course<00:06:21.819> all<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.270> these<00:06:22.479> are<00:06:22.750> in<00:06:22.990> my<00:06:23.289> preferred

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
course all of these are in my preferred

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.879 
course all of these are in my preferred
units<00:06:24.460> so<00:06:24.789> if<00:06:25.000> you're<00:06:25.419> different<00:06:25.810> you<00:06:26.560> can<00:06:26.770> be

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
units so if you're different you can be

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.529 
units so if you're different you can be
different<00:06:27.310> that's<00:06:27.520> cool<00:06:27.849> you<00:06:28.029> can<00:06:28.149> set<00:06:28.389> up

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
different that's cool you can set up

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.740 
different that's cool you can set up
however<00:06:28.810> you<00:06:29.229> want<00:06:29.379> now<00:06:30.279> this<00:06:30.879> is<00:06:31.210> like<00:06:31.479> I<00:06:31.629> was
