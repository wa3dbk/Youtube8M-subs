already<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.519> should<00:02:08.580> play<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.090> usual<00:02:09.750> set

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
already you should play with usual set

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.170 
already you should play with usual set
first<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.100> add<00:02:11.220> interactive<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
first then you can add interactive and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.479 
first then you can add interactive and
then<00:02:12.330> complex<00:02:13.549> seems<00:02:14.549> very<00:02:14.760> cool<00:02:15.830> ok<00:02:16.830> let's<00:02:17.250> go

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
we go okay let's check it out the loads

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:34.340 
we go okay let's check it out the loads
of<00:04:21.549> stuff<00:04:21.730> in<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.030> game<00:04:22.410> looks<00:04:23.410> really<00:04:23.890> cool

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.950 

well<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.650> guess<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.550> fan<00:04:37.090> family<00:04:37.780> game

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
well I guess this fan family game

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.300 
well I guess this fan family game
because<00:04:38.890> there<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.280> small<00:04:39.640> icon<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:41.310> think

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
because there is a small icon I think

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.250 
because there is a small icon I think
you<00:04:42.400> should<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:42.790> try<00:04:43.330> family<00:04:43.810> game<00:04:43.990> first

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
you should really try family game first

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.070 
you should really try family game first
and<00:04:44.530> I'll<00:04:44.890> try<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.250> first<00:04:45.970> too<00:04:46.770> ok<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:49.080> it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
and I'll try it first too ok and it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.190 
and I'll try it first too ok and it
seems<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.470> that's<00:04:51.160> all<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.580> get<00:04:51.790> but<00:04:52.540> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
seems that that's all you get but the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.960 
seems that that's all you get but the
quality<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.979> game<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.310> really<00:04:54.580> amazing

I don't know 200 maybe in each pack

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.340 
I don't know 200 maybe in each pack
really<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.570> lot<00:05:25.750> and<00:05:26.200> you<00:05:26.380> get<00:05:26.940> additional

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
packs for how the gameplay or more

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.460

interactive<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.760> get<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:35.200> loads

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
interactive and you get like loads

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.350 
interactive and you get like loads
of<00:05:35.800> those<00:05:36.729> tokens

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
of those tokens

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.270 
of those tokens
it's<00:05:39.360> really<00:05:39.720> rare<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.320> get<00:05:40.500> such

complex<00:05:42.270> just<00:05:42.690> for<00:05:43.200> one<00:05:43.410> game<00:05:43.790> so<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.820> think

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
complex just for one game so I think

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.220 
complex just for one game so I think
this<00:05:46.230> game<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.760> thingy<00:05:48.060> it's<00:05:48.870> very

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
this game is and the thingy it's very

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.520 
this game is and the thingy it's very
useful<00:05:49.680> for<00:05:49.710> example<00:05:50.250> in<00:05:50.990> other<00:05:51.990> my<00:05:52.230> games

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
useful for example in other my games

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.450 
useful for example in other my games
like<00:05:52.800> settlers<00:05:53.790> of<00:05:54.120> catan<00:05:54.690> or<00:05:55.070> whatever<00:05:56.070> they

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
like settlers of catan or whatever they

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.960 
like settlers of catan or whatever they
like<00:05:56.670> never<00:05:56.970> put<00:05:57.300> those<00:05:57.480> packets<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.350> that's

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
like never put those packets and that's

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.800 
like never put those packets and that's
really<00:05:59.970> good<00:06:00.840> decision<00:06:01.590> I<00:06:01.940> think<00:06:02.940> that<00:06:03.570> man

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
really good decision I think that man

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.550 
really good decision I think that man
games<00:06:04.110> made<00:06:05.060> really<00:06:06.060> great<00:06:06.330> package<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.170> the

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
games made really great package and the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.680 
games made really great package and the
game<00:06:07.710> itself<00:06:08.040> is<00:06:08.250> number<00:06:08.550> two<00:06:08.700> on<00:06:08.760> board<00:06:09.390> game

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
game itself is number two on board game

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.650 
game itself is number two on board game
geek<00:06:09.930> list<00:06:10.350> so<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.860> think<00:06:11.070> you<00:06:11.940> really<00:06:12.360> should

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660
