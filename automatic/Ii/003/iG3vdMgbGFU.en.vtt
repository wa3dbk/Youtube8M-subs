00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
them now this is a really neat mod I've

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
them now this is a really neat mod I've
never<00:01:39.960> seen<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> before<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.910> I'm<00:01:41.910> pretty<00:01:42.180> glad

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
never seen it before and I'm pretty glad

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
never seen it before and I'm pretty glad
corona<00:01:42.990> 42<00:01:43.410> brought<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:43.979> attention

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
corona 42 brought this to my attention

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.030 
corona 42 brought this to my attention
because<00:01:44.910> it's<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.420> unique<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.440> think

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
because it's really unique and I think

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.680 
because it's really unique and I think
the<00:01:47.369> person<00:01:47.610> who<00:01:47.910> modded<00:01:48.330> this<00:01:48.479> on

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
the person who modded this on

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.560 
the person who modded this on
matchmaking<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.580> very<00:01:50.729> smart<00:01:50.940> unless

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
matchmaking that's not very smart unless

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.910 
matchmaking that's not very smart unless
you<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.200> care<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.440> your<00:01:52.649> xbox

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you really don't care about your xbox

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.810 
you really don't care about your xbox
account<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.930> probably<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.050> BAM<00:01:55.580> but<00:01:56.580> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
account then probably you BAM but I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520 
account then probably you BAM but I
wouldn't<00:01:57.420> mind<00:01:57.570> seeing<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.110> may<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.380> on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
wouldn't mind seeing this may be on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
wouldn't mind seeing this may be on
custom<00:01:58.979> games<00:01:59.190> or<00:01:59.399> something<00:01:59.789> I<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.660> really

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
custom games or something I don't really

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.830 
custom games or something I don't really
know<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.920> guess<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.330> would<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
know I guess that it would just kind of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.550 
know I guess that it would just kind of
be<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.250> spot<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.930> except<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.289> would<00:02:07.410> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
be a spot in a way except it would just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.900 
be a spot in a way except it would just
have<00:02:07.770> everybody<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.759> low

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
have everybody would have really low

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
have everybody would have really low
damage<00:02:09.090> essentially<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.170> works<00:02:10.380> just

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
damage essentially because it works just

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.330 
damage essentially because it works just
like<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> DMR<00:02:11.400> would<00:02:11.700> work<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:14.100> would

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
like a DMR would work it's just it would

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.630 
like a DMR would work it's just it would
be<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> binary<00:02:15.900> rifle<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:17.250> yeah<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
be as like a binary rifle but yeah I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360 
be as like a binary rifle but yeah I
thought<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.180> would<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.600> neat<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.440> it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
thought this would really neat and it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.220 
thought this would really neat and it
happened<00:02:20.760> throughout<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> whole<00:02:21.269> game<00:02:21.299> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
happened throughout the whole game it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.860 
happened throughout the whole game it
wasn't<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.799> one<00:02:23.040> person<00:02:23.250> doing<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.910> at

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
wasn't just like one person doing it at

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630 
wasn't just like one person doing it at
the<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> within<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.739> first<00:02:26.010> minute<00:02:26.250> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the like the within the first minute it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.030 
the like the within the first minute it
wasn't<00:02:27.299> really<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:28.739> later<00:02:28.890> on

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
wasn't really going on but then later on

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.820 
wasn't really going on but then later on
you<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.760> people<00:02:29.940> who<00:02:30.900> anybody<00:02:31.230> who<00:02:31.590> had

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you just see people who anybody who had

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.660 
you just see people who anybody who had
a<00:02:32.269> team<00:02:33.269> armed<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.840> would<00:02:34.500> shoot<00:02:34.799> would

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
a team armed and would shoot would

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
a team armed and would shoot would
automatically<00:02:36.239> get<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> binary<00:02:36.930> rifle

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
automatically get like a binary rifle

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.910 
automatically get like a binary rifle
killed<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.440> mod<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
killed so I think that this mod is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800 
killed so I think that this mod is
pretty<00:02:41.580> neat<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.390> person<00:02:42.570> who

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
pretty neat I think the person who

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
pretty neat I think the person who
bought<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.019> wasn't<00:02:43.860> very<00:02:43.950> smart<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.579> doing

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
bought it wasn't very smart for doing

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
bought it wasn't very smart for doing
about<00:02:44.820> matchmaking<00:02:45.329> but<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:46.350> pretty<00:02:46.500> much

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
about matchmaking but that's pretty much

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.080 
about matchmaking but that's pretty much
