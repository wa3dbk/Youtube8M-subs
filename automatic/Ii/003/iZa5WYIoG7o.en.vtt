00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.910 

I<00:01:28.460> like<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.880> new<00:01:30.180> experience<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.440> world<00:01:31.650> cup

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I like the new experience the world cup

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.480 
I like the new experience the world cup
in<00:01:32.100> by<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> solar<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.229> i<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.190> double

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
in by the solar and i right the double

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.070 
in by the solar and i right the double
crank<00:01:35.760> set<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.290> 40<00:01:37.800> 28<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.780> think

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
crank set with the 40 28 and I think

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.850 
crank set with the 40 28 and I think
that's<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.940> for<00:01:42.000> me<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:45.860> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that's very good for me the way this is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's very good for me the way this is
very<00:01:47.280> light<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.909> also<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.170> cube<00:01:49.770> factors

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
very light up and also the cube factors

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.260 
very light up and also the cube factors
better<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.780> good<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> woman<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
better and is good for the woman and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
better and is good for the woman and
also<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> brakes<00:01:55.280> make<00:01:56.570> better<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.869> little

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
also the brakes make better for little

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:16.340 
also the brakes make better for little
hands<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:59.040> women

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.080 

I<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.800> me<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.250> big<00:02:20.430> change<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
I think for me as a big change is the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.590 
I think for me as a big change is the
new<00:02:21.480> brake<00:02:21.870> stuff<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.700> new<00:02:24.300> brake

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
new brake stuff we have it new brake

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.920 
new brake stuff we have it new brake
stop<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.260> better<00:02:25.830> performance<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.910> can<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.870> that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
stop a better performance I can do that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
stop a better performance I can do that
or<00:02:28.520> operating<00:02:29.520> with<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.960> one<00:02:31.470> thing<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.190> I'm
