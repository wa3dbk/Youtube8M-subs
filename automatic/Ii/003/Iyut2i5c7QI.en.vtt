00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.910
 hello in this video I will teach you how to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.700
 put 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.700
 a song as a message tone 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.330
 a song as ringtone 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 good 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.840
 for the message that we will have 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.840
 we will have to go to our archives 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.990
 and here 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.020
 for those who follow if you already have 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.060
 a folder called a notification 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.100
 there you will add the songs that 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.470
 you want but for those who do not 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.579
 have as I do not have that folder 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.239
 I do not have it, we are going to give it to you 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 here 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 and we want a folder that says 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.750
 notification note 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.500
 times notifications 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.500
 notification we give ok 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.090
 already created then we go to our 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.090
 messages 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670
 configurations 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.160
 so that the only ones who do not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.160
 dan 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.539
 these are new ones that give us 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.550
 and good 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.200
 now we copy a song that we want 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.140
 to that folder 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.570
 they were like the tone of the message 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.610
 copy or move it I will copy that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.800
 lehman's decision 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.800
 I will not copy the night I know that I 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.849
 to be 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.200
 we do not go out 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.200
 let's go to the messages 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 regulations 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.280
 work 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.520
 notification configuration and 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.520
 select tone 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.580
 and here it is and it goes on between more and as 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.930
 they saw maybe the one that had 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.940
 put here are all that you 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.940
 I showed what I had shown them 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:17.310
 here we already have this a protector 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.620
 and for ringtone that's very easy 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.540
 that does not have to create folders or 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.270
 Nothing that nothing else with whom we get 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.270
 to our music or the producer 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.819
 Y 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.209
 we select whatever we want 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:53.230
 if we give you to tell you options in 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.230
 this case on a samsung galaxy i 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:04.299
 Well, they're going to give him here, he says, decide 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:04.299
 as tone has not been defined as tone 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.510
 and to show that they are fine we 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.560
 let's go to our settings 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.560
 we are going to 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.310
 sound 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.990
 notification tone 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.060
 we put the song that we want 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.600
 to accept 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 Y 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.889
 when call here is 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.400
 and then this has been all I hope today 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.910

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.350
