00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.289 

so<00:00:02.820> here's<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.120> solar<00:00:03.389> hot<00:00:03.810> water<00:00:03.870> heater<00:00:04.350> tank

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
so here's my solar hot water heater tank

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.789 
so here's my solar hot water heater tank
I've<00:00:06.299> got<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.600> clip<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.529> let<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
I've got this clip on here to let the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.890 
I've got this clip on here to let the
air<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.189> filling<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:08.639> right<00:00:08.940> now<00:00:09.830> and<00:00:11.900> here's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
air it's filling up right now and here's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.039 
air it's filling up right now and here's
where<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.139> cold<00:00:13.799> water<00:00:14.040> comes<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:15.750> pipe

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
where the cold water comes in this pipe

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.769 
where the cold water comes in this pipe
here<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.789> goes<00:00:17.789> down<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.300> goes<00:00:18.480> into<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
here and goes down that goes into a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630 
here and goes down that goes into a
siphon<00:00:19.260> tube<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.710> goes<00:00:19.770> into<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> bottom<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
siphon tube that goes into the bottom of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
siphon tube that goes into the bottom of
the<00:00:20.699> tank<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> then<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:21.990> hot<00:00:22.170> water<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the tank and then the hot water of

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.529 
the tank and then the hot water of
course<00:00:23.160> goes<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.640> there<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:24.150> goes<00:00:24.300> back

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
course goes out there and then goes back

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900 
course goes out there and then goes back
down<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> house<00:00:25.340> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> pressure

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
down into the house this is the pressure

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
down into the house this is the pressure
relief<00:00:27.300> valve<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.140> water's<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.590> start

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
relief valve the water's gonna start

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.929 
relief valve the water's gonna start
coming<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> minute<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.789> is

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
coming out of here in a minute this is

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.709 
coming out of here in a minute this is
filling<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> here's<00:00:32.210> here's<00:00:33.210> where<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
filling up so here's here's where the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
filling up so here's here's where the
heating<00:00:33.960> elements<00:00:34.440> were<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.460> plug

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
heating elements were and I just plug

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.040 
heating elements were and I just plug
these<00:00:36.120> holes<00:00:36.180> well<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.309> drain<00:00:39.050> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
these holes well this was the drain and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
these holes well this was the drain and
I<00:00:40.620> still<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> drain<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I still use this as a drain there the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.160 
I still use this as a drain there the
tanks<00:00:42.870> full<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:44.690> we're<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
tanks full now we're gonna take that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.840 
tanks full now we're gonna take that
clip<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
clip out there we go that's the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
clip out there we go that's the
temperature<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> pressure<00:00:48.570> relief<00:00:49.020> valve

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
temperature and pressure relief valve

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
temperature and pressure relief valve
that's<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.100> prevent<00:00:50.489> explosion<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.270> anything

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that's to prevent explosion or anything

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
that's to prevent explosion or anything
of<00:00:51.780> course<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.199> gonna<00:00:52.320> explode<00:00:52.410> didn't

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of course it's not gonna explode didn't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.779 
of course it's not gonna explode didn't
get<00:00:53.129> hot<00:00:53.280> enough<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> solar<00:00:54.090> power<00:00:54.449> but

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
get hot enough with the solar power but

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
get hot enough with the solar power but
anyhow<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.210> cold<00:00:57.480> water<00:00:57.690> sinks<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
anyhow the cold water sinks to the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
anyhow the cold water sinks to the
bottom<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> tank<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.430> goes<00:00:59.640> out<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
bottom of the tank and goes out the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
bottom of the tank and goes out the
outlet<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> goes<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.649> my

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
outlet and then it goes down to my

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.729 
outlet and then it goes down to my
collector<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.409> top<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
collector which is down there on top of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
collector which is down there on top of
my<00:01:04.860> power<00:01:05.100> shed<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> water

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
my power shed and then as the water

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
my power shed and then as the water
heats<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.549> rises<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> goes<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
heats up it rises and it goes up a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.350 
heats up it rises and it goes up a
little<00:01:10.020> zigzag<00:01:10.939> collector<00:01:11.939> made<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little zigzag collector made out of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.990 
little zigzag collector made out of
copper<00:01:12.720> tubing<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.310> insulated<00:01:14.670> glass

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
copper tubing it's in an insulated glass

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
copper tubing it's in an insulated glass
box<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> hot<00:01:17.189> water<00:01:17.430> comes<00:01:17.759> back

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
box and so then the hot water comes back

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
box and so then the hot water comes back
up<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.799> tube<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.049> goes<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.409> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
up to this tube here and goes back up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.570 
up to this tube here and goes back up
close<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> top<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> tank<00:01:25.070> where<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
close to the top of the tank where as it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.300 
close to the top of the tank where as it
cools<00:01:26.790> again<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> sink<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.710> go

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
cools again it's going to sink and go

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
cools again it's going to sink and go
back<00:01:29.520> down<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> sets<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> thermo

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
back down and so it sets up a thermo

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.399 
back down and so it sets up a thermo
siphon<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.420> keeps<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> water<00:01:33.750> flowing<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
siphon that keeps the water flowing and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.020 
siphon that keeps the water flowing and
circulates<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> tank

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
circulates it in the tank

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.330 
circulates it in the tank
and<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.720> after<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> few<00:01:37.259> hours<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.619> sunlight

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and so after a few hours of sunlight

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
and so after a few hours of sunlight
that<00:01:38.640> whole<00:01:39.210> tank<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.720> full<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.439> hot

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that whole tank will be full of hot

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.370 
that whole tank will be full of hot
water<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> reasons<00:01:42.360> tanks<00:01:42.840> painted

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
water and all the reasons tanks painted

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
water and all the reasons tanks painted
black<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.610> originally<00:01:45.060> tried<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
black was because I originally tried to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.270 
black was because I originally tried to
make<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> batch<00:01:45.960> heater<00:01:46.350> where<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
make a batch heater where I just put the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
make a batch heater where I just put the
whole<00:01:47.310> tank<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> Sun<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.079> happened

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
whole tank in the Sun but what happened

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.010 
whole tank in the Sun but what happened
was<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.729> heat<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.939> skin<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> tank

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
was it would heat the skin of the tank

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
was it would heat the skin of the tank
and<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> water<00:01:52.979> would<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.250> hot

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and a little bit of water would get hot

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
and a little bit of water would get hot
and<00:01:53.579> rise<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> top<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> tank<00:01:54.750> well

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and rise to the top of the tank well

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
and rise to the top of the tank well
when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> take<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> shower<00:01:55.979> cut<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> water<00:01:56.670> on

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
when you take a shower cut the water on

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.139 
when you take a shower cut the water on
wash<00:01:57.390> dishes<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:59.100> cold<00:01:59.369> water<00:01:59.579> starts<00:01:59.909> mixing

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
wash dishes the cold water starts mixing

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.359 
wash dishes the cold water starts mixing
immediately<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> couple

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
immediately and so I just get a couple

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.630 
immediately and so I just get a couple
minutes<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.790> hot<00:02:06.719> water<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.399> then<00:02:08.399> start

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
minutes of hot water and then start

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660 
minutes of hot water and then start
getting<00:02:08.819> cold<00:02:09.060> water<00:02:09.360> almost<00:02:09.720> immediately<00:02:10.670> so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
getting cold water almost immediately so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.860 
getting cold water almost immediately so
with<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.120> setup<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.569> thermo<00:02:13.080> siphon

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
with this setup the thermo siphon

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.890 
with this setup the thermo siphon
it<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:15.040> whole<00:02:15.190> tank<00:02:15.549> will<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.780> much

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it the whole tank will be pretty much

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.070 
it the whole tank will be pretty much
uniform<00:02:17.500> however<00:02:18.010> hot<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.909> I<00:02:19.480> do<00:02:19.540> need

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
uniform however hot it is and I do need

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320 
uniform however hot it is and I do need
to<00:02:20.170> insulate<00:02:20.530> though<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.580> way<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.000> will<00:02:22.090> stay

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
to insulate though that way it will stay

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.839 
to insulate though that way it will stay
fairly<00:02:23.080> hot<00:02:23.409> all<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.830> time<00:02:24.129> even<00:02:24.670> when<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
fairly hot all the time even when the

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.110 
fairly hot all the time even when the
Sun<00:02:25.060> Goes<00:02:25.269> Down<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:27.159> all<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:27.849> I'm<00:02:27.909> gonna<00:02:28.030> go

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
Sun Goes Down so all right I'm gonna go

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.300 
Sun Goes Down so all right I'm gonna go
down<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.540> show<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.230> bottom<00:02:29.860> half<00:02:30.099> of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
down and show the the bottom half of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.880 
down and show the the bottom half of
this<00:02:30.459> contraption<00:02:31.060> here<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> here's<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this contraption here so here's the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.479 
this contraption here so here's the
solar<00:02:36.099> collector<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:38.099> basically<00:02:39.099> just<00:02:39.250> some

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
solar collector it's basically just some

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.190 
solar collector it's basically just some
copper<00:02:39.849> tubing<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.599> soldered<00:02:41.079> together

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
copper tubing that I soldered together

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.589 
copper tubing that I soldered together
and<00:02:44.010> siliconed<00:02:45.010> them<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> piece<00:02:45.849> of<00:02:45.879> ten<00:02:46.299> and

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
and siliconed them to a piece of ten and

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.539 
and siliconed them to a piece of ten and
painting<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.140> whole<00:02:47.230> thing<00:02:47.500> flat<00:02:47.799> black<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
painting the whole thing flat black and

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.569 
painting the whole thing flat black and
put<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.150> box<00:02:49.450> which<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.989> insulated<00:02:50.579> with

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
put in this box which I insulated with

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.880 
put in this box which I insulated with
some<00:02:51.910> some<00:02:52.900> styrofoam<00:02:54.690> paneling<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.650> put

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
some some styrofoam paneling and I put

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.490 
some some styrofoam paneling and I put
this<00:02:57.010> glass<00:02:57.340> lid<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.910> here<00:02:58.269> just<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.930> before<00:02:59.379> is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
this glass lid on here just to before is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.470 
this glass lid on here just to before is
just<00:02:59.530> to<00:03:00.040> sort<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.340> help<00:03:00.519> seal<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.849> gap<00:03:01.209> there

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
just to sort of help seal the gap there

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
just to sort of help seal the gap there
I<00:03:01.510> need<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.049> ahead<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.230> reseal<00:03:02.709> this<00:03:02.950> too

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
I need to go ahead and reseal this too

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.339 
I need to go ahead and reseal this too
but<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:04.329> working<00:03:04.599> good<00:03:04.780> enough<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.319> know

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
but it's working good enough you know

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.050 
but it's working good enough you know
it's<00:03:05.680> got<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:06.040> instant<00:03:06.430> an<00:03:06.519> inch<00:03:06.909> of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it's got an instant an inch of

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.430 
it's got an instant an inch of
insulation<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:09.659> it<00:03:10.659> gets<00:03:10.810> pretty<00:03:11.049> hot<00:03:11.290> out

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
insulation and it gets pretty hot out

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.899 
insulation and it gets pretty hot out
here<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.739> full<00:03:11.980> Sun<00:03:12.310> for<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:13.329> few<00:03:13.390> hours<00:03:13.569> anyways

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
here in full Sun for a few hours anyways

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.330 
here in full Sun for a few hours anyways
so<00:03:15.909> anyhow<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.959> water<00:03:17.319> as<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.980> cool<00:03:18.130> water

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
so anyhow the water as the cool water

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.710 
so anyhow the water as the cool water
sinks<00:03:18.669> from<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.880> tank<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.419> was<00:03:19.540> showing

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
sinks from the tank that I was showing

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.289 
sinks from the tank that I was showing
you<00:03:19.900> earlier<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.889> comes<00:03:21.160> downhill<00:03:21.459> through

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
you earlier it comes downhill through

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.430 
you earlier it comes downhill through
this<00:03:22.419> line<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.269> one-way<00:03:26.079> check

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
this line and this is a one-way check

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.970 
this line and this is a one-way check
valve<00:03:27.069> here<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.359> that<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:28.660> night

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
valve here so that at night

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.979 
valve here so that at night
the<00:03:29.980> circulation<00:03:30.819> won't<00:03:31.150> reverse<00:03:31.510> because<00:03:31.810> it

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the circulation won't reverse because it

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.379 
the circulation won't reverse because it
would<00:03:32.109> cool<00:03:32.290> down<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.609> of<00:03:33.730> course<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.239> my

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
would cool down and of course this is my

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.970 
would cool down and of course this is my
low<00:03:34.599> low<00:03:35.139> drain<00:03:37.169> shutoff<00:03:38.169> valve<00:03:38.500> here<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:38.919> I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
low low drain shutoff valve here so I

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.119 
low low drain shutoff valve here so I
can<00:03:39.160> drain<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.609> system<00:03:39.819> if<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.359> need<00:03:40.569> to

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
can drain the system if I need to

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.979 
can drain the system if I need to
because<00:03:42.129> this<00:03:42.669> cold<00:03:43.239> water<00:03:43.449> is<00:03:43.599> actually

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
because this cold water is actually

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.809 
because this cold water is actually
coming<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.650> from<00:03:44.949> how<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.160> got<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> leak<00:03:45.609> here

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
coming in from how I got a leak here

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.210 
coming in from how I got a leak here
again<00:03:46.120> darn<00:03:46.449> it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
again darn it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.210 
again darn it
hmm<00:03:48.780> we'll<00:03:49.780> have<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.139> fix<00:03:50.349> that<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.889> a<00:03:50.949> small

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
hmm we'll have to fix that it's a small

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.650 
hmm we'll have to fix that it's a small
leak<00:03:51.489> though<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.150> that's<00:03:52.629> not<00:03:53.349> too<00:03:53.560> bad

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
leak though so that's not too bad

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.509 
leak though so that's not too bad
and<00:03:55.660> then<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.049> another<00:03:56.139> pressure<00:03:56.590> release

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
and then I have another pressure release

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.059 
and then I have another pressure release
valve<00:03:57.879> here<00:03:58.239> in<00:03:58.629> case<00:03:58.900> something<00:03:59.709> gets<00:03:59.829> hot

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
valve here in case something gets hot

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.150 
valve here in case something gets hot
just<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.519> try<00:04:00.699> to<00:04:00.760> prevent<00:04:01.060> leaks<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:03.040> that's
