00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.729
 hello carolina de floja dashi couscous and 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.019
 well I come with a first video that 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.789
 I hope it is not the last all 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.040
 will depend on the failure of the success of this 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:11.630
 that above all he threw a little bit for the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.970
 need that there are certain waves that in 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.290
 picture do not look the same then good and I 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.329
 I put to remove the paper from the wall 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.249
 from the children's room and I was given 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.169
 account that there are times that a process that 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.939
 you think it is very difficult because not 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.460
 it is as difficult as this case 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.650
 so then that's why I want to record a 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.369
 series of videos as they arise 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.900
 things that are easier to see and good at 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.640
 this case I think it 's much easier 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.470
 of what we thought there are thousands of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 online tutorials where you can 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.650
 choose a little bit the options and the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.780
 ring has caught is with a machine 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.360
 steam that steam machine better than 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.010
 iron then with an iron 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.440
 you will go see how easy they can go 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.700
 taking off on the wall paper like this 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.090
 how good I hope not 6 very critical 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.090
 with me 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.790
 As you can see, we have already half of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 of the room made 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.500
 the truth is that it is super fast 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 then good only I have left 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.370
 show you 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.370
 the process 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.970
 the steam 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.970
 we are planting 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.850
 to give our support 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.710
 so that later it costs us less because 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 let's make the paper commanders 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.310
 forgives 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 I have a spatula here 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.360
 if you see that it also comes out 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.829
 its our time 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.099
 because today it is better that you get out of a 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.099
 piece 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.120
 I also imagine that we see that the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.670
 paper is very soft 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.340
 is fatter as it is in this case this 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.019
 paper is biblical I think that always a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.139
 paper lines are not easier 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.139
 remove 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.260
 how can we not repeat the process of 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.769
 paper 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.769
 peace 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.340
 As you can see, it's not a lie, it's very easy 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.080
 I only have two sheets left, try it 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.129
 I guess it's also a little bit of 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.730
 manna 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.989
 this paper came out super easy 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.989
 the final result 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.700
 well it has been quite easier than 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.590
 who believed is true and what it seemed 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.940
 at first because tell you that to me 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.640
 I have also found it much more 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.100
 easy so nothing else out there we're going to 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.100
 leave and the next video will consist of 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.100
 Get back to papering the mask it 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.100
 revenge
