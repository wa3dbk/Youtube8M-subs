00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 as you have said rightly enough already 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.299
 four weeks and you can say that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.890
 I'm in a great moment of form 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.230
 the workouts are coming out very 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.870
 well the sensations are being 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.070
 also excellent this Saturday I run in 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 the half marathon of the suite and azpeitia 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 to do a little test just before 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.939
 of these four weeks and corroborate that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.470
 been in shape and good, well, with a lot of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.830
 Illusion and desire for this day to come 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 April 26 then the real goal because 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 well there's always the minimum what they are 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.579
 13 but you will create not only if 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 well I also part that in my 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 Selection for small is confirmed 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.059
 being the fourth in the European then 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.790
 Well, I'm going to fight to get a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.220
 great record 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.470
 talking to Antonio because he believes that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.720
 I can be worth two hours ten then by 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.970
 bonuses let's try it let's see the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.430
 group also that there are for Europeans in 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.110
 around to spend the half hour 430 believe 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.280
 which is the step so then good on 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.010
 all try to be the longest 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.110
 possible with that group and fight for that 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.550
 objective for his ambitious but good I 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.530
 I think that at the same time it has to be 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 realistic for me why not 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 fight for two hours 10 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 after this marathon according to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.030
 result than expected already 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 the river or you are going to do another one in autumn 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 what are your plans to facilitate but 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.909
 obviously I have to run the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.470
 world peking would be selected 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
 as I said before then for good 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.690
 now a preparation as best as possible 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.840
 I know it's not easy because in 2013 I 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.060
 the same thing happened and good because it 's a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 expensive preparation and difficult to recover 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 of the the April marathon but hey 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 try to get to Beijing as best as possible 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.190
 and then depending on that then 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 decide then already if I did not have a great 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.270
 record would not have gotten that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 position by posts thus raising a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 marathon to the eye in the middle of February and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.470
 you fight for that minimum as you see the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.450
 change because you were a cross fin 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.550
 a track athlete and now we access 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.170
 focused on marathon as you've seen the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.210
 change especially at the level of mediatismo 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010
 at the level of preparation how has that been 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.540
 change 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.910
 I honestly I'm happy to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.240
 as much on the media level as you say yes 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.850
 It's true that I think that running 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.350
 closer to the popular athlete we are 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.300
 much closer to him then then 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.470
 they feel more identified 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.170
 they run the same distance as you 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.000
 half marathon the 42 kilometers then 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.580
 how good it makes them feel as 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.130
 closer to us and I loved it and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.680
 good and then the truth that very well very 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.480
 happy marathon bra I think 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.370
 that found my test yes that is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.830
 true that it is an expensive preparation 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.040
 hard sacrificed but I can say 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.420
 that previously did not get the results that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.650
 I wanted on track and it was a marathon me 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.420
 I think I'm seeing that it's a test 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.970
 that adapts very well to my qualities 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.560
 and I think that from here to what I have left 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.110
 of a sports career I will be linked 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.070
 at this distance because I already believe that as 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.870
 I've said before I think I've 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.000
 found my test I know it's a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.410
 hard test because it demands a lot 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.420
 preparation many kilometers the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.080
 muscle wear is greater you can not 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.910
 compete many a year then good 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.670
 I will try to verify it in the best way 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.870
 possible but I already tell you that the present 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.440
 and the future of javier 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.440
 in the marathon
