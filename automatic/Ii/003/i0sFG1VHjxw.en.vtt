00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 then mister arrives turin but cannot 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.820
 torino who is very well this say 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 the results the latest results 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.540
 the priest knows how the truth is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.330
 good this verona to what I said 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.420
 the Verona did not deserve to lose 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.730
 however, Palermo is now part of the past 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.830
 the present and this difficult race 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.140
 because they come from a series 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 important eight useful results while 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.199
 victories below so these i 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.710
 numbers that continue talking game 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.780
 how they will all be from here to the end how 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.309
 it was that of palermo is that i am 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 left a little bitter taste in my mouth because 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.809
 I think it increases puts a free 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 I repeat it counts that of tomorrow and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.110
 we must be there you have found again 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 unfortunately lost jacopo hall that own 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 this season is not the most 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 lucky for him and recovered anyway 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.010
 also yankees oba wood of another that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 instead he doesn't want to know that for a while 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 him to return to the full 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 condition and jankovic and gomez 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 no no no no no no no no we do a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.729
 step back jankovic 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 it is not recovered and also of salt pans 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.579
 still not even part of the summoned 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.149
 so if it goes a little bit it runs a little too much 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.729
 so I guess of those short of 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:29.459
 units and gomez who made the match 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 half an hour Wednesday then just then 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:37.409
 if that's what I hope you don't 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 lengthen but still had a smente 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.470
 slowdown in recovery, however, is the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.659
 most important of the dictators begins 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.340
 in short I have lost you dark that it is a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 good player for us is then a boy 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 and I'm sorry but there too I am in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.960
 bad luck 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.329
 it's not a very serious thing we count are 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.539
 rich times are a little shorter and 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.750
 the last time is comparable to the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.220
 Championship turin ones to have 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 for what happened 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.549
 in the summer they too have lost men 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.260
 important as a mobile with cerci s 22 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.390
 we have lost many more changes 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.390
 so it's not two things completely 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 two completely different realities of their own 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.900
 they have ice cream under us and then they have 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.730
 made an important thread here is that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.569
 that I go ahead yesterday anyway director 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.870
 and what we are but also a bit of 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.079
 continuity here even if before 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.390
 palermo has only made some audiences i 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.079
 numbers that said and after the Florentine 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.670
 the juventus seems we had three points 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.260
 sorry because we could not deserve it 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.849
 of losing 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.120
 there was no danger of losing 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.920
 this game, however, is in series with this i 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.930
 details makes a difference to the states 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.370
 good at exploiting the only situation that 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.420
 have had in the second half and have 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.060
 won a game every every race of ours 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.880
 history each season equal to us a 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.799
 think of our home and tomorrow 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.049
 we find a repetition I place in his 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:11.400
 important, however, we play at home and 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.810
 want to make points the second one recently 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.060
 on the market since you've done this 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.799
 the market has closed 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.900
 company made this assessment 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.209
 in short, I believe in what we have 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.459
 since he built a good rose 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.410
 I think it is very important today that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.450
 andrea mandorlini c of gas and this one 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 team likes it if this team for 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.950
 he 's strong I think it's a moment 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.319
 very important also to pull away from 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.060
 misunderstandings etc. that have been created me 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.989
 I'm really waiting for an answer from that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.709
 from that kiryat gat and if anything the company 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.709
 nor but is the coach 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.640
 everyone has his idea I say it's more 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.910
 strong and some say it is not strong nor 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.070
 there are those who say that Marco is finished that he can 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.680
 say we are in a democracy everyone can say 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.970
 what you say 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.590
 for me my players are always 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.290
 were better than those who do not 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.820
 they are good the coach must do of 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.070
 all to make you better at 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.780
 those who are here I always rare the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.220
 satisfied with this I always have 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.200
 reasoned so and always have been 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.820
 satisfied with what i've got 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.920
 always tried to give the maximum how 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.560
 I did it I don't make my players 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.519
 so does society , everyone did it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 and so we all have them 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.040
 created we always come from outside 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.080
 inside we know we have a rose that 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.750
 can fight to the end must fight 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.100
 and I have to do all the others 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.790
 are speeches that leave a little 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.800
 time you find 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.470
 the word the fact that you like this 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.500
 in my opinion, however, from what 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.750
 were fans of a written fan but yes 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.850
 you know what I'm talking about if you don't owe me 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.290
 pleasure of players which is not either 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.060
 neither in heaven nor on earth 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.249
 I seem to have given ample guarantees in 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.229
 these years of so many players with 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.089
 several technical features one 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.179
 on the other hand, he always looked for why 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:02.039
 I want you to go for attempts to try to 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:04.139
 give all rai out the maximum from 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.409
 each therefore from this point of view 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.269
 I really had no more peace 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.699
 for me the players knew better because 

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.949
 one must work to improve e 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.469
 the coach is on purpose the coach must 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.329
 train and therefore those who may be missing 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.369
 something must put you in a position to 

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:21.719
 give because the coach his staff are 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:22.919
 ready to do it 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.779
 in fact my last question was 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.519
 right on the player that in this one 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:31.499
 moment is giving the best it had left 

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:33.749
 so so quagliarella be 8 flight for 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:36.139
 the fundamental attacker to unlock himself yes 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:40.769
 it is unlocked in I see it in a way that 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.459
 therefore important to grasp the plays 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:43.709
 next 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:48.259
 we have ours we are pleased with 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:50.219
 have ours as rigo said and then 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.709
 we must keep in our other 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.989
 attackers and put in conditions of 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.209
 also their sum of finding the goal they 

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:58.679
 I think it's important for everyone first 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.649
 of the end of the market 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:03.419
 you said no there will be a fake new us 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:05.339
 We will invent a fake myler I want you 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.880
 ask this right now 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:10.280
 vice tones 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.170
 and cappelluzzo that for characteristics 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.540
 physical looks more like tones 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.980
 or it can really be another one 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.020
 it's not exactly a first tip like 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.660
 like tones but that may be it 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.950
 staff that is a first tip not 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.990
 depended first nature if tones then pian 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.530
 really keep it as a good click again 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:36.560
 should our stomach ache 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:39.620
 striker with a tip is joined is a 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.460
 smart boy can play there can 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.860
 play outdoor tip and then can too 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.180
 see also gerry euro or another 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.180
 strikers always punish the parts of 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.820
 calder novara right now here 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:57.170
 healed that where tonight tones 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:02.030
 It becomes hope not an attack 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.980
 acute begging we have serious problems 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.750
 but if a party that has united can 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.100
 do that well then there is 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.840
 also scalp and is doing it 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.140
 viareggio fine young boys 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.140
 perspectives
