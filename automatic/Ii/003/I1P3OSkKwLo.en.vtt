00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.099 

from<00:00:04.130> water<00:00:04.340> sprout<00:00:04.700> we<00:00:05.270> just<00:00:05.479> installed<00:00:05.960> a

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
from water sprout we just installed a

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.980 
from water sprout we just installed a
rainwater<00:00:06.620> system<00:00:07.370> for<00:00:07.790> a<00:00:07.819> client<00:00:08.360> Rosalind

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
rainwater system for a client Rosalind

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.240 
rainwater system for a client Rosalind
here<00:00:09.170> in<00:00:09.230> San<00:00:09.410> Ramon<00:00:09.710> and<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:10.070> we're<00:00:10.219> just

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
here in San Ramon and so we're just

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.369 
here in San Ramon and so we're just
going<00:00:10.550> through<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:10.940> system<00:00:11.120> okay<00:00:11.929> look<00:00:12.259> at

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
going through the system okay look at

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.739 
going through the system okay look at
the<00:00:12.499> different<00:00:12.799> components<00:00:12.940> let's<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.570> this

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:14.749 
the different components let's so this

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.830 
the different components let's so this
is<00:00:14.959> the<00:00:15.280> connection<00:00:16.280> to<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.880> gutter<00:00:17.180> up<00:00:17.480> there

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
is the connection to the gutter up there

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.359 
is the connection to the gutter up there
so<00:00:18.320> we<00:00:18.440> have<00:00:18.650> our<00:00:18.800> connection<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.280> the

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
so we have our connection to the

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.310 
so we have our connection to the
downspout<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.240> gutter<00:00:20.420> with<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.840> downspout

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
downspout the gutter with the downspout

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.140 
downspout the gutter with the downspout
pipe<00:00:21.590> we're<00:00:21.949> routing<00:00:22.160> it<00:00:22.490> around<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.300> house

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
pipe we're routing it around the house

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.450 
pipe we're routing it around the house
and<00:00:26.150> we<00:00:26.300> come<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:26.960> our<00:00:26.990> first<00:00:27.650> flush<00:00:28.009> diverter

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
and we come to our first flush diverter

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.450 
and we come to our first flush diverter
okay<00:00:29.210> there's<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.660> there<00:00:30.560> screening<00:00:31.220> on<00:00:31.339> the

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
okay there's a there screening on the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.430 
okay there's a there screening on the
gutter<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.939> keeps<00:00:32.150> out<00:00:32.360> larger<00:00:32.810> debris<00:00:33.230> and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
gutter that keeps out larger debris and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.729 
gutter that keeps out larger debris and
right<00:00:34.270> it's<00:00:35.270> like<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.480> gutter<00:00:35.809> cover<00:00:35.899> on<00:00:36.500> there

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
right it's like a gutter cover on there

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.860 
right it's like a gutter cover on there
the<00:00:36.980> first<00:00:37.190> level<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.579> filtration<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.780> we

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
the first level of filtration and we

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.660 
the first level of filtration and we
come<00:00:39.110> down<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.620> water<00:00:39.800> comes<00:00:40.070> down<00:00:40.309> to

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
come down and the water comes down to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.459 
come down and the water comes down to
the<00:00:40.850> first<00:00:41.120> flush<00:00:41.480> device<00:00:41.870> which<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.289> this

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
the first flush device which is this

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.639 
the first flush device which is this
large<00:00:42.739> -<00:00:43.129> okay<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.210> walls<00:00:44.420> okay<00:00:45.050> find<00:00:45.559> at

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
large - okay to the walls okay find at

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.410 
large - okay to the walls okay find at
your<00:00:45.800> hardware<00:00:45.949> store<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.120> basic

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
your hardware store so the basic

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.090 
your hardware store so the basic
principle<00:00:47.539> is<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.140> chamber<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.859> rainwater

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
principle is this chamber the rainwater

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.099 
principle is this chamber the rainwater
first<00:00:49.550> comes<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.030> fills<00:00:50.239> up<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:50.660> chamber

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
first comes and fills up this chamber

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.810 
first comes and fills up this chamber
right<00:00:51.289> here<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.920> have<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.190> ball<00:00:52.370> down<00:00:52.640> at

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
right here so you have the ball down at

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.790 
right here so you have the ball down at
the<00:00:52.940> bottom<00:00:53.120> yeah<00:00:53.750> well<00:00:54.170> there's<00:00:54.469> no<00:00:54.590> ball

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
the bottom yeah well there's no ball

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400 
the bottom yeah well there's no ball
there's<00:00:55.280> no<00:00:55.460> ball<00:00:55.699> in<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.059> one<00:00:56.300> oh<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:57.199> water

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
there's no ball in this one oh the water

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.259 
there's no ball in this one oh the water
just<00:00:57.620> flows<00:00:57.829> down<00:00:58.399> into<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> chamber<00:00:59.030> and

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
just flows down into the chamber and

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.630 
just flows down into the chamber and
then<00:00:59.420> at<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.660> bottom<00:00:59.840> of<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.320> chamber

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
then at the bottom of the chamber

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.330 
then at the bottom of the chamber
there's<00:01:01.640> all<00:01:02.030> unscrew<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:02.600> at<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.840> bottom

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
there's all unscrew this at the bottom

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.770 
there's all unscrew this at the bottom
there's<00:01:04.340> a<00:01:04.400> small<00:01:04.760> filter<00:01:05.150> screen<00:01:05.540> right<00:01:05.750> here

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
there's a small filter screen right here

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.429 
there's a small filter screen right here
okay<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.430> what<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.030> does<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:08.780> protects

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
okay so what this does is this protects

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.770 
okay so what this does is this protects
the<00:01:09.500> dual<00:01:09.830> drip<00:01:10.070> emitter<00:01:10.340> from<00:01:10.700> clogging<00:01:11.479> up

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
the dual drip emitter from clogging up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.010 
the dual drip emitter from clogging up
with<00:01:11.930> sediment<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.509> basically<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.780> water

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
with sediment so basically the water

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.870 
with sediment so basically the water
drips<00:01:15.650> out<00:01:15.799> through<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.220> little<00:01:16.430> emitter

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
drips out through this little emitter

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.359 
drips out through this little emitter
here<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.420> bottom<00:01:17.950> but<00:01:18.950> during<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.220> rain

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
here at the bottom but during a rain

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.100 
here at the bottom but during a rain
event<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:19.790> whole<00:01:19.939> chamber<00:01:20.210> fills<00:01:20.689> up<00:01:20.900> this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
event this whole chamber fills up this

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.480 
event this whole chamber fills up this
water<00:01:21.470> only<00:01:21.590> drips<00:01:21.860> out<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.220> at<00:01:22.369> about

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
water only drips out of this at about

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.870 
water only drips out of this at about
two<00:01:22.700> gallons<00:01:23.090> per<00:01:23.329> hour<00:01:23.390> okay<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:25.700> whole

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
two gallons per hour okay so this whole

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.760 
two gallons per hour okay so this whole
chamber<00:01:26.090> fills<00:01:26.479> up<00:01:26.689> with<00:01:26.720> water<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
chamber fills up with water and then it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.819 
chamber fills up with water and then it
starts<00:01:28.070> overflowing<00:01:28.430> into<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.450> tank<00:01:29.829> when

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
starts overflowing into the tank when

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.830 
starts overflowing into the tank when
they're<00:01:30.950> almost<00:01:31.100> at<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.520> top<00:01:31.640> yeah<00:01:32.479> where

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
they're almost at the top yeah where

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.080 
they're almost at the top yeah where
it's<00:01:33.079> connected<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.430> starts<00:01:34.759> as<00:01:34.909> this

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's connected and it starts as this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.249 
it's connected and it starts as this
chamber<00:01:35.390> fills<00:01:35.600> up<00:01:35.780> then<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.049> starts

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
chamber fills up then it starts

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.859 
chamber fills up then it starts
overflowing<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.939> left<00:01:38.180> there<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.659> plate

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
overflowing to the left there that plate

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.840 
overflowing to the left there that plate
to<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.110> left<00:01:39.350> yeah<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.460> goes<00:01:40.640> into

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
to the left yeah and then it goes into

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.310 
to the left yeah and then it goes into
this<00:01:41.090> first<00:01:41.390> tank<00:01:41.720> over<00:01:42.110> here

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
this first tank over here

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.370 
this first tank over here
when<00:01:42.740> when<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.310> rain<00:01:43.520> stops<00:01:44.090> this<00:01:44.930> chamber

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
when when the rain stops this chamber

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.080 
when when the rain stops this chamber
empties<00:01:45.799> through<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:46.310> little<00:01:46.610> drip<00:01:46.790> emitter

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
empties through this little drip emitter

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.709 
empties through this little drip emitter
just<00:01:50.049> okay<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:51.409> if<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.770> want<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.189> keep<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.149> rain

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
just okay now if I want to keep the rain

connected together I'm you can see the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.970 
connected together I'm you can see the
piping<00:02:38.180> at<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.360> bottom<00:02:38.690> there's<00:02:39.350> set<00:02:39.680> out<00:02:39.800> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
piping at the bottom there's set out the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
piping at the bottom there's set out the
union<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.910> then<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.300> goes<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.750> other

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
union and then it goes to the other

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.800 
union and then it goes to the other
tanks<00:02:42.290> okay<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.400> one<00:02:43.610> fills<00:02:43.940> up<00:02:44.240> then<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
tanks okay so this one fills up then it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.940 
tanks okay so this one fills up then it
goes<00:02:44.990> into<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.410> other<00:02:45.560> one

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
goes into the other one

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.590 
goes into the other one
yeah<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.520> other<00:02:46.580> ones<00:02:46.940> connected<00:02:47.450> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
yeah but the other ones connected to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.660 
yeah but the other ones connected to
another<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.110> er<00:02:48.140> yeah

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.980 

flush<00:02:55.670> diverter<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.330> then<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.510> goes<00:02:56.630> into<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
flush diverter and then it goes into the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:07.120 
flush diverter and then it goes into the
tank<00:02:57.170> over<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:57.680> okay<00:03:05.530> now<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.710> happens

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
tank over here okay now what happens

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.610 
tank over here okay now what happens
when<00:03:07.340> they<00:03:07.490> get<00:03:07.730> filled<00:03:08.690> up<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> keeps

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
when they get filled up but it keeps

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.010 
when they get filled up but it keeps
raining<00:03:09.830> through<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.610> vent<00:03:10.940> talk<00:03:11.750> for<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
raining through the vent talk for the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.590 
raining through the vent talk for the
tank<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.980> it'll<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.450> accumulate<00:03:14.450> in

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
tank and so it'll just accumulate in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.120 
tank and so it'll just accumulate in
this<00:03:14.720> area<00:03:14.990> like<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.290> was<00:03:15.440> before<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:15.980> just

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130

the top and just spill boys there a
gauge<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:22.100> will<00:03:22.160> show<00:03:22.580> me<00:03:22.610> how<00:03:23.240> much<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.600> in

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
gauge that will show me how much is in

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.590 
gauge that will show me how much is in
the<00:03:23.900> tank<00:03:24.140> yeah<00:03:24.620> when<00:03:25.430> when<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> dial<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.510> at

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
the tank yeah when when the dial is at

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.380 
the tank yeah when when the dial is at
80<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.080> means<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.500> full<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:29.000> refers<00:03:29.360> to

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
80 that means it's full that refers to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.390 
80 that means it's full that refers to
80<00:03:29.690> inches<00:03:30.110> that's<00:03:30.440> okay<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.250> not

80 inches that's okay it's not
percentage<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:33.320> then<00:03:33.890> obviously<00:03:34.100> when<00:03:34.520> it's

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
percentage and then obviously when it's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.010 
percentage and then obviously when it's
down<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.910> zero<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.360> tanks<00:03:35.630> empty<00:03:35.750> okay<00:03:36.710> so<00:03:38.020> so

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.810 
down to zero the tanks empty okay so so
when<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:39.410> at<00:03:39.530> 20<00:03:40.010> then<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.550> about<00:03:40.760> a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.350 
tanks go into the garage so there has
you've<00:03:57.709> got<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.070> purple<00:03:58.310> pipes<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:59.060> show<00:03:59.209> that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
you've got the purple pipes to show that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.480 
you've got the purple pipes to show that
it's<00:03:59.540> recyclable<00:03:59.990> here's<00:04:00.740> just<00:04:00.980> that

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
it's recyclable here's just that

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.980 
it's recyclable here's just that
connects<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.150> other<00:04:02.300> tank<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.870> then

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
connects to the other tank and then

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.470 
connects to the other tank and then
here's<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.680> what<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.280> pump<00:04:04.550> draws<00:04:04.910> from<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
here's the what the pump draws from the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.680 
here's the what the pump draws from the
tank<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:05.990> this<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.350> water<00:04:06.530> coming<00:04:06.709> out

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
tank so this is the water coming out

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.390 
tank so this is the water coming out
we<00:04:08.230> have<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.350> shutoff<00:04:08.590> valve<00:04:08.890> here<00:04:09.070> we<00:04:09.280> have<00:04:09.370> a

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
we have a shutoff valve here we have a

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.600 
we have a shutoff valve here we have a
union<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.970> then<00:04:10.090> here's<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.990> pump<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.130> this

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
union and then here's the pump and this

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.490 
union and then here's the pump and this
pump<00:04:12.850> sucks<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.420> water<00:04:13.570> from<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:14.080> tank<00:04:14.260> its

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
pump sucks the water from the tank its

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.370 
pump sucks the water from the tank its
own<00:04:14.680> lol<00:04:15.130> jet<00:04:15.400> pump<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.959> much<00:04:17.170> bigger

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
own lol jet pump so is it much bigger

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.150 
own lol jet pump so is it much bigger
than<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.860> expected<00:04:17.980> it<00:04:18.549> today<00:04:19.230> yeah<00:04:20.230> it'd<00:04:20.769> be<00:04:21.040> a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
than I expected it today yeah it'd be a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.790 
than I expected it today yeah it'd be a
little<00:04:21.310> tiny<00:04:21.610> thing<00:04:21.790> about<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.870> size<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.260> that

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.380 

and<00:04:26.800> then<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.490> line<00:04:27.700> that's

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
and then this is the line that's

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:46.500 
and then this is the line that's
pressurized<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.520> first<00:04:45.730> filter<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.330> goes

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
pressurized so the first filter it goes

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.030 
pressurized so the first filter it goes
through<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.110> just<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.560> pressure<00:04:47.800> gauge

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
through it's just a pressure gauge

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.410 
through it's just a pressure gauge
telling<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.550> what<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.760> persistent<00:04:49.210> pressure

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
telling you what the persistent pressure

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.050 
telling you what the persistent pressure
huh<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:50.710> first<00:04:50.950> filter<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.580> sediment

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
huh this first filter is a sediment

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.880 
huh this first filter is a sediment
filters<00:04:52.420> that<00:04:52.630> captures<00:04:53.140> or<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.500> larger

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
filters that captures or the larger

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.550 
filters that captures or the larger
sediment<00:04:54.400> okay<00:04:55.030> it's<00:04:55.180> in<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> system<00:04:55.560> this

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
sediment okay it's in the system this

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.030 
sediment okay it's in the system this
next<00:04:56.920> one<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.280> smaller<00:04:57.990> carbon<00:04:58.990> filter<00:04:59.380> so

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
next one is a smaller carbon filter so

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.980 
next one is a smaller carbon filter so
this<00:05:00.190> one<00:05:00.400> catches<00:05:01.060> set<00:05:01.270> really<00:05:01.750> fine

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
this one catches set really fine

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.720 
this one catches set really fine
sediment<00:05:02.500> but<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.830> also<00:05:03.010> if<00:05:03.400> there's<00:05:03.610> any

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
sediment but it also if there's any

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.790 
sediment but it also if there's any
color<00:05:04.090> or<00:05:04.360> odor<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.900> may<00:05:05.020> be<00:05:05.080> present<00:05:05.380> in<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
color or odor that may be present in the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.300 
color or odor that may be present in the
water<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:07.030> will<00:05:07.210> remove<00:05:07.540> that<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:09.100> then

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
water that will remove that and then

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.860 
water that will remove that and then
finally<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:09.880> goes<00:05:10.000> through<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:10.450> UV<00:05:10.840> light

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
finally it goes through this UV light

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.990 
finally it goes through this UV light
filter<00:05:11.470> right<00:05:11.650> here<00:05:11.860> which<00:05:12.220> sterilizes<00:05:12.970> the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
filter right here which sterilizes the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.810 
filter right here which sterilizes the
water<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.480> kills<00:05:13.720> any<00:05:13.960> sort<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.770> pathogens<00:05:15.520> or

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
water it kills any sort of pathogens or

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.970 
water it kills any sort of pathogens or
any<00:05:16.090> sort<00:05:16.420> of<00:05:16.540> bacteria<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.590> may<00:05:17.830> be<00:05:17.860> present

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
any sort of bacteria that may be present

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.390 
any sort of bacteria that may be present
in<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.520> wine<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:19.210> then<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.590> then<00:05:21.130> always

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
in the wine and then the and then always

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.760 
in the wine and then the and then always
connection<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.390> have<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.690> washing<00:05:23.470> machine

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
connection you have the washing machine

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.560 
connection you have the washing machine
which<00:05:24.010> is<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.190> cold<00:05:24.490> water<00:05:24.610> yes<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:25.270> this<00:05:25.419> is

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
which is the cold water yes so this is

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.780 
which is the cold water yes so this is
the<00:05:25.690> cold<00:05:25.900> water<00:05:25.960> hose<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.680> then<00:05:27.370> here's<00:05:27.669> the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
the cold water hose and then here's the

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.750 
the cold water hose and then here's the
future<00:05:28.150> connection<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.020> instantaneous

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
future connection to the instantaneous

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.120 
future connection to the instantaneous
put<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.790> little<00:05:31.030> electric<00:05:31.810> hot<00:05:32.470> water<00:05:32.770> heater

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
put a little electric hot water heater

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.770 
put a little electric hot water heater
over<00:05:33.370> there<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:33.910> then<00:05:34.030> have<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.360> hot<00:05:34.510> water

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
over there and then have the hot water

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.270 
over there and then have the hot water
come<00:05:35.110> down<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.440> other<00:05:35.590> side

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
come down the other side

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.240 
come down the other side
so<00:05:36.400> this<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.700> totally<00:05:37.470> separate<00:05:38.470> from<00:05:38.620> my

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
so this is totally separate from my

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.680 
so this is totally separate from my
house<00:05:39.840> water<00:05:40.840> yes<00:05:41.200> this<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.560> not<00:05:41.680> connected<00:05:41.950> to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
house water yes this is not connected to

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.140 
house water yes this is not connected to
here<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:43.930> there's<00:05:44.140> no<00:05:44.350> backflow<00:05:45.190> film<00:05:45.820> that<00:05:46.090> I

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
here so there's no backflow film that I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.390 
here so there's no backflow film that I
have<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.570> put<00:05:46.810> on<00:05:47.020> prevention<00:05:47.560> basically<00:05:48.250> if

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
have to put on prevention basically if

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.300 
have to put on prevention basically if
if<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.940> rain<00:05:49.090> water<00:05:49.300> cisterns<00:05:49.810> run<00:05:50.110> out<00:05:50.320> and

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
if the rain water cisterns run out and

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.490 
if the rain water cisterns run out and
they<00:05:51.640> go<00:05:51.790> dry<00:05:52.060> during<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.480> summer<00:05:52.720> well<00:05:53.410> you

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
they go dry during the summer well you

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.340 
they go dry during the summer well you
basically<00:05:53.620> just<00:05:53.950> have<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.250> do<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.669> you<00:05:54.820> unscrew

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
basically just have to do is you unscrew

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.409 
basically just have to do is you unscrew
the<00:05:56.350> laundry<00:05:57.160> hose<00:05:57.370> from<00:05:57.580> here<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:58.120> then<00:05:58.300> you

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
the laundry hose from here and then you

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.170 
the laundry hose from here and then you
screw<00:05:58.780> on<00:05:59.010> house<00:06:00.010> boy<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> cold<00:06:01.000> water

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
screw on house boy to the cold water

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.630 
screw on house boy to the cold water
supply<00:06:01.330> right<00:06:01.840> here's<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.890> that's<00:06:03.220> actually

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
supply right here's that that's actually

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.880
