00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.110
 cordial greeting to my draco friend that we

 has fervently requested this review 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.660
 of the 7 x 7 cube of the big tour brand 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.440
 for all our friends subscribers 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.840

 a warm greeting and we are going to do the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.240
 review of this great big rubik cube 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:56.140
 ok this is the pick up 7 for 7 x 7 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.870
 a very famous and well-known cube of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.910
 rubik for the speed very used in the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.760
 competition for our good friend Felix 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.379
 and we will start to see its composition 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.930
 internal 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.080
 these are the pieces that make up the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.920
 club 7 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.530
 all designed to assemble very 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.710
 methodically between them let's see 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 here the composition of the cube we can see 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.380
 like the pieces of green innovations 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.160
 which are the ones that have the patent of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 this magnificent cube of rubik assemble 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.230
 of wonder among themselves 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.630
 we can see the great quality of the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.170
 pieces the plastic is very very good 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 quality and the 7 x 7 that I have tried 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 I can say that the brand of my club 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.290
 in the materials with which it is 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.300
 elaborated are insurmountable 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.340
 it is very very resistant I have fallen 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.690
 several times and the cube is like that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.810
 nothing 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.730
 in quality for the competition the cube 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 factory comes very hard and very slow to the 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.560
 principle I must say that when I 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.470
 take out of his box his blister had to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.720
 move it this way 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.090
 so hard that comes new but you're 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 can do some modifications 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.220
 the cube can even be made adjustable 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 and we will have a great big speed bucket or 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.340
 we can also improve it by 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.830
 overuse use it and use it and use it 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.580
 one over and over again and the cube will go 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 becoming a little more malleable a little 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.250
 more flexible for the bucket and ends 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.170
 being for me the best 7 x 7 cube 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.420
 What is it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 it will have to be compared perhaps in the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.730
 next days with the new game show 7 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.069
 for 7 but 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.319
 for now we will have to wait for that 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.190
 revision 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.640
 how can you see here what 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.580
 his speed is optimal I like that 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.720
 all lines have a fast 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.890
 accommodation has a quick comfortable between 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.530
 they 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.440
 has or accept cutting corners no 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.720
 you need to be completely together 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.720
 these lines so that the line cut 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.210
 cuts the corner very well and in the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.350
 centric part with a few 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.160
 centimeters that gives us and we respect 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.410
 before copying in European 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.280
 the cube if it has a little degree of 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.610
 pope or as you just saw it only 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.980
 This piece is voted on by these pieces that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.200
 here has actually pops are not 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.680
 very big but at least to me 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.360
 they happen a little frequent 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.130
 maybe it's because my movements do not 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.400
 are the clean ones or because the cube is still 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.110
 does not have the relevant modifications 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.840
 but I saw that just as it comes from the factory 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.200
 if it tends to have a degree of poteo 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.569
 from medium to medium high 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.780
 outside of that all the lines work 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.050
 perfectly fine 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.840
 one after another moves the wonder 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.280
 they have a very simple handling with this 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.639
 shape 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.799
 a little oval that has this 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.660
 oval ending that has and that 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.480
 facilitates its management 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.389
 the size is optimal the size is optimal 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.310
 It's not very big, it's not too small in 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.000
 pro of the seven lines that make it up 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.560
 I think these stickers are very good 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.900
 I already have a little worn because 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.730
 this is my club but the stickers of 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.880
 factory come very very good like all 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.900
 those of the bic brand 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.169
 They are made of canvas and they wear very 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.529
 hardly 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.919
 I widely recommend the cube of 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.889
 7 x 7 of the bic brand and you have to 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.979
 give a test you have to give a 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.800
 opportunity and as soon as 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.779
 compare it and make your decision with the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.660
 game show 7 for 7 that next 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:13.380
 we will have the review on this channel 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.730
 without more for the time mission accomplished 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.720
