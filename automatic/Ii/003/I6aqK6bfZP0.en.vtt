00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
see I am set up with the lower cog now

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.459 
see I am set up with the lower cog now
when<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.060> come<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> peddle<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.599> my<00:02:41.019> chain<00:02:41.290> should

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
when I come to peddle it my chain should

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.500 
when I come to peddle it my chain should
actually<00:02:41.859> drop<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.519> starting<00:02:42.939> position<00:02:43.090> my

actually drop to my starting position my
natural<00:02:43.900> starting<00:02:44.349> position<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.519> you

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
natural starting position so now you

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.420 
natural starting position so now you
guys<00:02:45.939> can<00:02:46.000> see<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.870> now<00:02:47.560> we're<00:02:47.739> properly<00:02:47.980> set

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
natural position that we need to start

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.319 
natural position that we need to start
so<00:03:30.829> I'm<00:03:31.040> going<00:03:31.189> to<00:03:31.219> pedal<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:31.939> I'm<00:03:32.180> going

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
so I'm going to pedal and now I'm going

so I'm going to pedal and now I'm going
to<00:03:32.390> go<00:03:32.510> through<00:03:32.719> all<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> gears<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:33.980> get<00:03:34.189> up

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
to go through all the gears so I get up

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.000 
to go through all the gears so I get up
to<00:03:34.489> my<00:03:34.670> lower<00:03:34.879> limit<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:38.140> as<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.290> do<00:03:39.349> this<00:03:39.709> I'm

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
to my lower limit and as I do this I'm

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.250 
to my lower limit and as I do this I'm
going<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.640> be<00:03:41.359> dealing<00:03:41.720> with<00:03:41.750> barrel

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
going to be dealing with barrel

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
going to be dealing with barrel
adjustment<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:42.890> we<00:03:43.129> talked<00:03:43.400> about<00:03:43.670> earlier

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
adjustment like we talked about earlier

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.360 
adjustment like we talked about earlier
in<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.450> tech<00:03:44.689> tip<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:45.109> barrel<00:03:45.709> adjustment<00:03:46.250> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
in the tech tip of barrel adjustment and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.929 
in the tech tip of barrel adjustment and
this<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.510> fine-tune<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:49.159> rear

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
this is to fine-tune your rear

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.819 
this is to fine-tune your rear
derailleur<00:03:50.269> so<00:03:51.200> I'm<00:03:51.260> going<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.409> go<00:03:51.530> up<00:03:51.620> one

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
derailleur so I'm going to go up one

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.490 
derailleur so I'm going to go up one
here<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.239> notice<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:53.840> hasn't<00:03:54.170> gone<00:03:54.260> up

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
here and if you notice it hasn't gone up

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.369 
here and if you notice it hasn't gone up
so<00:03:54.799> I'm<00:03:55.069> going<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.280> make<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.609> adjustment<00:03:56.379> I'm

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
so I'm going to make that adjustment I'm

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.970 
so I'm going to make that adjustment I'm
going<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.650> turn<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:59.620> until<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.680> gear

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
going to turn it in until that gear

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.129 
going to turn it in until that gear
moves<00:04:01.189> up<00:04:03.939> there<00:04:04.939> it<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.900> want<00:04:06.049> to

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
moves up there it is and you want to

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.020 
moves up there it is and you want to
hear<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.379> move<00:04:06.560> up<00:04:06.709> nice<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:06.980> clean<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:07.939> I'm

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
hear it move up nice and clean so I'm

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.420
