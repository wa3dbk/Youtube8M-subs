00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.889
 Welcome 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.259

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.029
 damn cactus or how are we going to 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.320
 draw a cactus in the end I think what 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.119
 main will be to catch the sand and 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.460
 change what has been all the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.540
 soil is good to do them always 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.220
 they have desert and we are going to make a cactus 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.660
 handsome handsome in the middle of all this not 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.279
 I have no idea draw good cactus no 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.140
 I have no idea to draw anything but 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.690
 especially a cactus because I have less 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.360
 idea of ​​the usual so nothing too 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.129
 we catch a little bit of water worth to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.280
 make a kind of me that I know what we're going 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.620
 to make guys a kind of mirage 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 and what we're going to do here something like that in 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.030
 nice plan and we are going to put water here 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 let's do like this with a form a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.660
 little bit of irregular, not to be left 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.340
 more beautiful and it's good because it's always 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.870
 it's like I do not know I think so 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.420
 well, we can give enough this is worth the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.649
 chemical issue and here came the subject of 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.989
 cactus because I'm going to make a cactus 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.130
 big a nice but good cactus is 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.839
 I do not know what a nice cactus looks like 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.310
 really that is, they have touched me for 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.439
 draw a pretty pretty theme 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.060
 complicated in physics is for this video 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.700
 I would like to be able to exceed the amount of 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.050
 the 5,000 come guns likes x 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.910
 very much but good 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.280
 I know that among all of us we can and it is already 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.750
 let's come to it come let's make a 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.810
 handsome cactus well we have do this 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.480
 because this would be super shabby worth 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.550
 a small fails should not I'm not going to 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.860
 use cactus can use wool because the 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.300
 cactus does not let us make it this way 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.920
 I want to do it in different 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.190
 tonalities and with shapes and the cactus in 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 yes it does not leave us or it is worth it well 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.300
 you do not have to make a cactus like that 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.080
 we can do the helm this is like 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.600
 a cactus but but because it would not be 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
 well and would be very ugly and I do not know it 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.790
 this we are going to do it like this like this 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.470
 perfect this so well like this like this and 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.240
 is that I do not know what else to put to the touch and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.470
 honestly, that is, we put a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.470
 hat of these Mexicans 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.370
 I do not know when and a poncho and a hat 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.540
 Mexican to the cactus but not 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.890
 reactions very in conversation but 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.720
 good come today are the guys for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.160
 do something funny and such because I know 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.390
 that it's going to be obviously impossible to win 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.030
 because people will have made some here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.489
 cactus takes bread and wets but I 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.480
 sincerely guys sincerely good 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.920
 unfortunately and so is that what I 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.300
 it's been little huelva 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.500
 so nothing's worth we're going to do here 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.320
 this 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.580
 how we can do it to see would be 1 2 3 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.050
 4 or 5 valdez of 5 and here is 1 2 3 4 vale 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.130
 and this would be what has been the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.540
 half would be something like that the hat 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.470
 mexican what happens that is super 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.180
 shabby 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.560
 so let's do a little bit more more 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.170
 nice ok let's do it in plan in 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 I do not know how to emboss for something like that 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.380
 let's do 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.090
 and we could put a poncho but 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.890
 Like people would not know what there is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.310
 things like that then I do not know if it 's words 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 put a poncho people is that so 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.780
 that is super fat I do not like going to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 do it as we had it look so you know 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 let's do them yes but let's do it 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.300
 well it is already the Mexican man of 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.590
 done a moment this I will remove 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.060
 this is not going to remove and here we are going to put 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.830
 a carpet I believe because team to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.560
 to be as big fat bigger 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.580
 hat that the cactus so 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.020
 unfortunately I do not like it very much 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.300
 put them and the truth we are going to put here 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.450
 this rug is orange carpet and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.930
 attentive to iwate and akita matrix without 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.030
 offend or is typical not typical 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.260
 typical guacamole sauce that they sell in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.670
 the supermarket you know you have a 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.460
 cactus with a punch 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780
 is drawn we can put eyes what 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.970
 it happens that it's not double so it's going to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.260
 be a little fail so here we can 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.270
 put them the same let's put it now 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.830
 particles and things of these to which 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.120
 particular we can put this is going to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.920
 be very important I think that you 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.270
 we can part said no I think that 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.460
 we can put particular as well as 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.630
 as de saint and we can give quite the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.740
 we're really going to put particles of 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.160
 slime to capture 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.900
 Périz and this is true and this is already here 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.190
 I think if we can give quite the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 degrees is fine is like with a 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.820
 Mexican hat and we can put it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.230
 eyes but both eyes 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.330
 is worth because it is that if not 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.060
 guys I'm sorry to say but there's no where 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.890
 put eyes like that and so we do and that's how it is 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.680
 that is too ugly uncles is for me 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.200
 this is too ugly but good 12 like this 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.420
 so more more cute we should do 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.550
 guys anyway, and this one more 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.750
 we're going to make a deal and that's almost what 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.640
 least we can make a face 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.110
 poor cactus is worth it because if it is not going 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.020
 to be super ugly and no no I do not want 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.120
 have a good ugly cactus so something is 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.740
 something 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.630
 is that my mother boys send orders 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.250
 noses or the cactus so ugly that 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.780
 we are doing or should they go to the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.430
 jail to make cactus so ugly 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.050
 to give you an idea several this 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.060
 It's the ugliest cactus in the universe. 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.510
 to break this and let's make it a double 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.689
 and bigger is worth it so here here and 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.009
 good here 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:55.189

 more epic characters add a but 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.660
 what happens

 that as we say the guys that got us out 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.300

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.660
 ugly or that is super ugly is to hit a

 father with a sweaty sock and this day 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.450
 that seems to have made a cell because 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.310
 we realized but they have made them super 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.770
 pairs and the skewers of a cactus are not 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.470
 parents I do not know this is not cool this 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.210
 it seems here and cell 211 you know it seems 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.440
 decoration and is not worth this type of 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.300
 cactus that I like good come 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.700
