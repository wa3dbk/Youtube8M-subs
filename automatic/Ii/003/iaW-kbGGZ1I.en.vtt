00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
them forever

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.509 
them forever
me<00:02:26.930> tomorrow<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.349> just<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.709> regular<00:02:28.099> Mario

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
me tomorrow is just like regular Mario

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.670 
me tomorrow is just like regular Mario
though<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:28.970> he<00:02:29.060> gets<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.360> once<00:02:29.630> he's<00:02:29.900> dead<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
though if he gets it once he's dead so I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.870 
though if he gets it once he's dead so I
think<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.799> only<00:02:33.890> way<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.099> can<00:02:34.220> kill<00:02:34.430> guys<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
think the only way you can kill guys is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.729 
think the only way you can kill guys is
with<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> ground<00:02:35.450> pound<00:02:35.750> which<00:02:36.019> counts<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.650> a

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
with a ground pound which counts as a

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.650 
with a ground pound which counts as a
normal<00:02:37.099> jump

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
normal jump

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.060

my enemy so I'd be careful when using

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.470 
my enemy so I'd be careful when using
him<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:44.320> know<00:02:45.320> I'm<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.770> over<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:47.330> can
