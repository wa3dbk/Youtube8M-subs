00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
still works miraculously so basically I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
still works miraculously so basically I
just<00:00:52.500> start<00:00:52.829> by<00:00:54.469> like<00:00:55.469> separating<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.399> hair<00:00:56.899> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
just start by like separating my hair in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.369 
just start by like separating my hair in
half<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.829> side<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:01.250> clip<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:03.379> nothing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and then you just work by taking chunks

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.870 
and then you just work by taking chunks

it<00:03:50.629> a<00:03:50.750> lot<00:03:50.959> longer<00:03:51.200> than<00:03:51.469> if<00:03:51.919> your<00:03:52.069> fine<00:03:52.370> blond

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
processed and treated as much as -

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.059 
processed and treated as much as -
because<00:04:00.669> it'll<00:04:01.669> fall<00:04:01.849> out<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.940> basically<00:04:06.069> this

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
because it'll fall out so basically this

straight iron to just the tips and that

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.480 
straight iron to just the tips and that
creates<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:46.039> cooler<00:04:46.490> look<00:04:46.820> -<00:04:47.120> sometimes<00:04:47.630> but

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490
