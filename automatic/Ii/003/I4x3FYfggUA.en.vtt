welcome to the string whore review of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.490 
welcome to the string whore review of
the<00:00:07.890> new<00:00:08.069> Wilson's<00:00:08.550> theme<00:00:08.820> 99s<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:10.110> comes<00:00:10.349> in

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the new Wilson's theme 99s it comes in

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.290 
the new Wilson's theme 99s it comes in
with<00:00:10.590> 99<00:00:11.040> squared<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.759> name<00:00:11.969> implies

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
with 99 squared as the name implies

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.539 
with 99 squared as the name implies
waits<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.500> three<00:00:13.740> hundred<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.099> four<00:00:14.309> grams

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
waits for three hundred and four grams

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.640 
waits for three hundred and four grams
of<00:00:14.730> balance<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.210> three<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.690> five<00:00:15.990> millimeters

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
of balance of three to five millimeters

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.340 
of balance of three to five millimeters
and<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.520> string<00:00:17.820> pattern<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.359> sixteen<00:00:18.900> fifteen

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
and a string pattern of sixteen fifteen

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.730 
and a string pattern of sixteen fifteen
and<00:00:20.150> this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> designed<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> create<00:00:22.260> huge

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and this is designed to create huge

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
and this is designed to create huge
amounts<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.039> spin<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> that's<00:00:24.060> exactly<00:00:24.510> what

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
amounts of spin and that's exactly what

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.320 
amounts of spin and that's exactly what
it<00:00:24.720> does<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:25.260> they've<00:00:25.529> put<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> great<00:00:26.039> poly

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
it does if they've put in a great poly

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.870 
it does if they've put in a great poly
and<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:28.830> distance<00:00:29.279> between<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> strings

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and the distance between the strings

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
and the distance between the strings
allows<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> greater<00:00:30.810> snapback<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
allows for a greater snapback not only a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
allows for a greater snapback not only a
greater<00:00:32.460> step<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.059> much<00:00:33.210> quicker<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
greater step back but much quicker so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.090 
greater step back but much quicker so
the<00:00:33.870> revolutions<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> ball<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:34.980> be

the revolutions the ball is gonna be
much<00:00:35.250> higher<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:37.890> does<00:00:38.219> kick<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:39.030> off

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
much higher it really does kick up off

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.389 
much higher it really does kick up off

the off off of off of any ground stroke

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.850 
the off off of off of any ground stroke
you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.390> catch<00:00:42.570> shoes<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> topspin<00:00:43.710> off

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you can catch shoes and that topspin off

your head back and kick serve was was

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.160 
your head back and kick serve was was
brilliant<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.690> great<00:00:48.899> for

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
brilliant with it it's great for

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
brilliant with it it's great for
maneuver<00:00:49.559> around<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.920> court<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.090> was

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
maneuver around the court and I was

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
maneuver around the court and I was
actually<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.629> surprised<00:00:51.989> moving<00:00:52.320> forward

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually really surprised moving forward

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.689 
actually really surprised moving forward
to<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> net<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.190> thinking<00:00:53.489> there's<00:00:53.610> gonna

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
to the net I was thinking there's gonna

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.160 
to the net I was thinking there's gonna
be<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> bit<00:00:53.969> spongy<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.719> soft

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
be a bit spongy bit soft

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.959 
be a bit spongy bit soft
coming<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> net<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> quad

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
coming into the net with a with a quad

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
coming into the net with a with a quad
with<00:00:57.270> unbelievably<00:00:57.930> open<00:00:58.260> string<00:00:58.469> cutting

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
with unbelievably open string cutting

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
with unbelievably open string cutting
but<00:00:59.129> actually<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.430> found<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> quite

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
but actually I found it to be quite

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
but actually I found it to be quite
stiff<00:01:01.020> bracket<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.770> solid<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> net<00:01:02.430> easy

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
stiff bracket very solid at the net easy

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
stiff bracket very solid at the net easy
to<00:01:03.510> maneuver<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.559> only<00:01:04.710> 304<00:01:05.640> grams<00:01:06.560> but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to maneuver as it's only 304 grams but

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
to maneuver as it's only 304 grams but
equally<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.490> had<00:01:08.700> enough<00:01:08.970> pop<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> enough

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
equally it had enough pop and enough

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
equally it had enough pop and enough
power<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.170> away<00:01:10.350> ball<00:01:10.590> east<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
power to put away ball east how did you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
power to put away ball east how did you
find<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.810> enjoyed<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
find it you know I really enjoyed the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
find it you know I really enjoyed the
frame<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.890> found<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:14.790> forgiving

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
frame and found it to be very forgiving

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.710 
frame and found it to be very forgiving
very<00:01:15.540> spinner<00:01:16.200> friendly<00:01:17.210> wasn't<00:01:18.210> such<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> fan

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
very spinner friendly wasn't such a fan

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
very spinner friendly wasn't such a fan
of<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> net<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.860> Ben<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
of it at the net as Ben was but it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
of it at the net as Ben was but it
definitely<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> job<00:01:21.689> done<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> could

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
definitely got the job done if you could

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.870 
definitely got the job done if you could
stick<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.619> volleys<00:01:22.920> definitely<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.729> down

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
stick your volleys definitely more down

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
stick your volleys definitely more down
to<00:01:24.030> my<00:01:24.119> technique<00:01:24.570> than<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> racket<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to my technique than the racket I really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
to my technique than the racket I really
count<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> court<00:01:27.659> were

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
count out the back of the court were

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.679 
count out the back of the court were
this<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.470> spin<00:01:29.369> technology<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> Wilson<00:01:30.479> put

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this the spin technology that Wilson put

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
this the spin technology that Wilson put
in<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.960> does<00:01:31.350> exactly<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> says<00:01:32.189> huge

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
in there does exactly what it says huge

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
in there does exactly what it says huge
amounts<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> spin<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> even<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> try<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
amounts of spin and even if you try and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
amounts of spin and even if you try and
flatten<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.579> you're<00:01:35.970> still<00:01:36.090> getting<00:01:36.360> enough

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
flatten out you're still getting enough

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
flatten out you're still getting enough
revolutions<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> ball<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.979> causing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
revolutions on the ball that is causing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
revolutions on the ball that is causing
damage<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> other<00:01:39.000> end<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> court

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
damage on the other end of the court

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.789 
damage on the other end of the court
which<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.549> quite<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.150> benefit<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.530> game

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which was a quite and benefit to my game

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.440 
which was a quite and benefit to my game
because<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> head<00:01:44.640> I'd<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> stare
