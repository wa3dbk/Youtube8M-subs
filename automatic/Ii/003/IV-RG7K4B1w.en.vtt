00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 see this electric range will be 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.859
 completed by 7 6 3 it is rather the eight 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.330
 which will complete the i3 which therefore had a 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.559
 city - dweller halfway compact we had 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.360
 seen in case of door and who now he 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.020
 declining in three doors that I find 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.170
 it's very very very very successful 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:23.100
 again because it is both light 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 while being very bm invents them a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 new style this car she is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 desirable because it is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 contemporary 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 you like it jean luc moreau I like it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 you think we will have a car in series 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.739
 also stripped finally I acquired this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.629
 be fair to the central screen is what is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 no names but I mean this 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.390
 will to simplify to the extreme where 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 small example for me is ultimate 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 the one tesla only one screen so is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 of a respective size but we get 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.750
 very well 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.110
 we do not need to have declared 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.930
 moors 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.920
 we have something very intense 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.070
 and all the cars there two big 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.660
 screens as to a tablet 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.050
 the right and the meters in the center 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.890
 it is very beautiful it is very aerial 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:18.040
 could almost have a place at 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.040
 center is very zen very pretty wise and 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.479
 very well done 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.970
 there are two biases that are opposed 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.390
 but whoever is legitimate brings it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.689
 an indret button to the world in the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.610
 passion boeing boeing defense and some 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.229
 share that's what we want and then to 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.930
 from the moment we want a driving 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:45.100
 Zen I think it's okay 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.720
 the new driving spirit 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 we agree it was the bmw i3 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.289
 soon in our streets where I believe early 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.119
 2014 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.300
 more or less under this on his big 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.300
 lines
