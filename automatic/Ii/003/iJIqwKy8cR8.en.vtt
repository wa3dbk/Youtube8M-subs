for<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.210> was<00:00:12.420> guilty<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.259> using<00:00:13.559> face

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
for it I was guilty of just using face

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.680 
for it I was guilty of just using face
wipes<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> maybe<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> moisturizer<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.540> I'm

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
wipes and maybe a moisturizer but as I'm

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
wipes and maybe a moisturizer but as I'm
getting<00:00:15.839> older<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.410> kind<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.920> feel<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.850> skin

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
getting older I kind of can feel my skin

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060 
getting older I kind of can feel my skin
becoming<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:19.080> more<00:00:19.230> well

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
becoming a little bit more well

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
becoming a little bit more well
sensitive<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> little<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> little

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
sensitive and a little these a little

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.900 
sensitive and a little these a little
bit<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.080> TLC<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.580> my

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
