really<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.390> we're<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.900> really

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
really not we're going to have a really

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
really not we're going to have a really
high<00:00:43.680> fire<00:00:43.980> rate<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> still<00:00:44.910> works<00:00:45.150> it's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
high fire rate but it still works it's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
high fire rate but it still works it's
still<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.570> decent<00:00:45.840> gun<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.710> personal

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
still a decent gun in my personal

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.550 
still a decent gun in my personal
opinion<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.420> try<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.720> second<00:00:49.140> best<00:00:49.230> assault

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
opinion the try the second best assault

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.290 
opinion the try the second best assault
rifle<00:00:49.950> Remington<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.180> more

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
rifle Remington is a little bit more

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.670 
rifle Remington is a little bit more
accurate<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.900> this<00:00:51.990> one<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> definitely<00:00:52.380> more

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
accurate but this one is definitely more

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.600 
accurate but this one is definitely more
more<00:00:53.400> powerful<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.600> opinion<00:00:55.460> let's<00:00:56.460> go

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
more powerful in my opinion let's go

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360
