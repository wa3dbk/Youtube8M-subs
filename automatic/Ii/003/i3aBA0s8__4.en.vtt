and<00:02:51.599> make<00:02:52.599> sure<00:02:52.630> he's<00:02:52.900> black<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:54.510> scale<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.660> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and make sure he's black and scale up a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.140 
and make sure he's black and scale up a
beige<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.349> big<00:02:56.500> enough<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:58.060> you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
beige is not big enough and then you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.690 
beige is not big enough and then you
just<00:02:58.329> want<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:59.670> put<00:03:00.670> some<00:03:02.400> brush<00:03:03.400> strokes

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
just want to just put some brush strokes

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.349 
just want to just put some brush strokes
over<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:05.170> text<00:03:05.700> don't<00:03:06.700> worry<00:03:06.850> if<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> doesn't

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
over the text don't worry if it doesn't

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.000 
over the text don't worry if it doesn't
look<00:03:07.480> good<00:03:07.750> right<00:03:07.959> now<00:03:08.170> sort<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> minute

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.199 

don't<00:03:13.640> have<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.939> cover<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.629> whole<00:03:14.810> thing<00:03:15.080> and

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
don't have to cover the whole thing and

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.280 
don't have to cover the whole thing and
you<00:03:17.209> want<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.420> set<00:03:17.599> that<00:03:17.750> layer<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.530> highlight

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
you want to set that layer to highlight

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.580 
you want to set that layer to highlight
so<00:03:21.290> you're<00:03:21.409> not<00:03:21.530> hard<00:03:21.709> light<00:03:21.920> multiply<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
so you're not hard light multiply and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.559 
so you're not hard light multiply and
then<00:03:24.590> bring<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.459> opacity<00:03:25.730> down<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:28.459> about<00:03:28.879> 20

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
then bring the opacity down to about 20

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.729 
then bring the opacity down to about 20
and<00:03:31.269> then<00:03:32.269> after<00:03:32.629> that<00:03:32.659> you're<00:03:33.409> going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> want

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
and then after that you're going to want

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.809 
and then after that you're going to want
to<00:03:33.829> create<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.159> new<00:03:34.280> layer<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:36.010> then<00:03:37.010> get<00:03:37.700> your

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
to create a new layer and then get your

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.649 
to create a new layer and then get your
Galaxy<00:03:40.819> brush<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:43.060> scale<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.090> down<00:03:44.239> with<00:03:44.540> it

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
Galaxy brush and scale it down with it

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.740 
Galaxy brush and scale it down with it
so<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.200> quite<00:03:45.409> small<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.299> want<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.569> go

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
so it's quite small you just want to go

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.710 
so it's quite small you just want to go
around<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.700> want<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.000> use<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.150> pencil<00:03:50.359> for

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
around so you want to use the pencil for

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.259 
around so you want to use the pencil for
this<00:03:51.099> play<00:03:52.099> don't<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.790> want<00:03:52.909> to<00:03:52.970> use<00:03:53.090> the

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
this play don't you want to use the

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.449 
this play don't you want to use the
pressure<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.379> here's<00:03:55.069> where<00:03:55.220> we<00:03:55.310> go

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
pressure this and here's where we go

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.920 
pressure this and here's where we go
around<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.909> text<00:03:56.299> just<00:03:56.540> making<00:03:57.409> random

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
around you text just making random

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.289 
around you text just making random
implements<00:03:59.930> anywhere<00:04:01.030> doesn't<00:04:02.030> really

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
implements anywhere doesn't really

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:13.340 
implements anywhere doesn't really
matter<00:04:02.540> where

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.460 

and<00:04:14.240> that<00:04:15.240> is<00:04:15.570> basically<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.200> for<00:04:16.290> this

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and that is basically it for this

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.040 
and that is basically it for this
tutorial<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.180> want<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.510> go<00:04:18.570> ahead<00:04:18.720> and

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
tutorial if you want to go ahead and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.620 
tutorial if you want to go ahead and
give<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.380> some<00:04:19.830> fancy<00:04:20.400> border<00:04:20.790> are<00:04:20.910> gradients

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
give it some fancy border are gradients

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.260 
give it some fancy border are gradients
then<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.890> thing<00:04:23.040> you<00:04:23.250> want<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:24.000> right

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
then the thing you want to do is right

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.850 
then the thing you want to do is right
click<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.660> layer<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.110> go<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.320> alpha<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
click the layer and go to alpha the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.910 
click the layer and go to alpha the
selection<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.700> then<00:04:26.850> you'll<00:04:27.030> be<00:04:27.090> able<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.510> do

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
selection and then you'll be able to do

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.080 
selection and then you'll be able to do
gradients<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.040> anything<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.490> wanted<00:04:29.880> but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
gradients and anything you wanted but

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.130 
gradients and anything you wanted but
