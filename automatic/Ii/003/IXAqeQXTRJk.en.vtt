00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.829
 - 4 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.749
 a plaintiff decide 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.480

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.469
 were the 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.389
 Traces make them look good 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.239
 to say the goal 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.319
