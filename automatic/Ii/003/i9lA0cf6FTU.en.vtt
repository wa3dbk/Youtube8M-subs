thing that I called a skylight I wanted
to<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:07.109> full<00:00:07.410> video<00:00:08.030> to<00:00:09.030> see<00:00:09.210> what<00:00:09.240> it

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
to do the full video to see what it

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.000 
to do the full video to see what it
looks<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.290> want<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.530> put<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.800> here

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.669 
looks like the one I want to put in here
is<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> multi-level<00:00:11.940> farm<00:00:12.210> system<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.840> i'll

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
is a multi-level farm system and i'll

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.430 
is a multi-level farm system and i'll
probably<00:00:13.889> put<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.340> down<00:00:14.519> there<00:00:15.199> may<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.230> one

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
probably put one down there may be one

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.800 
probably put one down there may be one
in<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.160> maybe<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.520> second<00:00:18.210> floor<00:00:18.480> third

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
in here and maybe a second floor third

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
in here and maybe a second floor third
floor<00:00:18.869> coming<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.619> through<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.250> then

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
floor coming up through here and then

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.910 
floor coming up through here and then
another<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.600> may<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.230> over<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
another one may be over in here

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.439

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
going to make the farm system for the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.029 
going to make the farm system for the
space<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:45.020> super<00:00:46.039> humongous

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
space now this is the super humongous

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
space now this is the super humongous
large<00:00:47.370> base<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.120> made<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> did<00:00:49.920> was

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
large base that I made so what I did was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.299 
large base that I made so what I did was
I<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:51.030> block<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.690> every<00:00:51.960> fifth<00:00:53.360> as<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
I put a block on every fifth as I want I

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.410 
I put a block on every fifth as I want I
want<00:00:56.309> three<00:00:56.879> blocks<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:58.260> between<00:00:59.120> the<00:01:00.120> crop

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
want three blocks in between the crop

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.359 
want three blocks in between the crop
and<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> bottom<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> irrigation<00:01:03.600> channel

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and the bottom of the irrigation channel

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
and the bottom of the irrigation channel
so<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.630> many<00:01:06.840> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so you don't have to have that many to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
so you don't have to have that many to
would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.860> sufficient<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
would be sufficient but I just want a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.690 
would be sufficient but I just want a
little<00:01:10.110> more<00:01:10.260> room<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.640> went

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
little more room in there so we went

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100 
little more room in there so we went
ahead<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.939> mark<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> i<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.020> i'm

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
ahead and mark this off and i think i'm

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.390 
ahead and mark this off and i think i'm
going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.189> top

level this particular right side is
going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> end<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> five<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.670> over<00:01:20.850> here

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
going to end of five this one over here

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
going to end of five this one over here
is<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.460> not<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> be

side<00:01:30.680> I'm<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> connect<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.490> through<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
side I'm going to connect it through the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
side I'm going to connect it through the

gonna<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> wood<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.229> top<00:01:43.470> level

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
gonna make it out of wood the top level

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.969 
gonna make it out of wood the top level
out<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> wood<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:45.619> I'm<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
out of wood and then I'm just going to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
out of wood and then I'm just going to

just<00:02:04.210> kind<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.480> orientate<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.990> video<00:02:05.200> here

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
just kind of orientate the video here

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.050 
just kind of orientate the video here
real<00:02:05.530> quick<00:02:05.770> up<00:02:06.550> here<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.910> little

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
real quick up here on this this little

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.300 
real quick up here on this this little
skylight<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.260> built<00:02:11.500> up<00:02:11.770> here<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
skylight that I built up here in the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.480 
skylight that I built up here in the
farm<00:02:12.520> system<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:13.060> got<00:02:13.540> two<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.130> two<00:02:15.130> bubbles

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
farm system I got two to two bubbles

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.000 
farm system I got two to two bubbles
over<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.420> I've<00:02:17.080> got<00:02:17.260> four<00:02:17.500> levels<00:02:17.830> over

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
over there and I've got four levels over

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.240 
over there and I've got four levels over
here<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.410> talked<00:02:20.620> about<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.860> wanted<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
here like I talked about I wanted to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.250 
here like I talked about I wanted to
make<00:02:21.370> those<00:02:21.810> too<00:02:22.810> deep<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.360> irrigation

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
make those too deep for the irrigation

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.220 
make those too deep for the irrigation
channels<00:02:26.940> speaking<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.120> skylight<00:02:28.600> what

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
channels speaking of that skylight what

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.280 
channels speaking of that skylight what
I<00:02:29.260> decided<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.950> do<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:31.480> waste<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.110> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
I decided to do was not waste of that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.470 
I decided to do was not waste of that
and<00:02:32.590> make<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> skylit<00:02:33.850> go<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> way<00:02:34.209> through

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
and make a skylit go all the way through

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.540 
and make a skylit go all the way through
that<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.020> gets<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.380> dark<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.920> dismal<00:02:36.340> down

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
that it gets really dark and dismal down

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.550 
that it gets really dark and dismal down
there<00:02:36.760> at<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.910> bottom<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.630> thought<00:02:37.810> man

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
there at the bottom so I thought man

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.630 
there at the bottom so I thought man
wouldn't<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.010> cool<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.580> could

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
wouldn't it be really cool if I could

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.490 
wouldn't it be really cool if I could
just<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.480> know<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.840> skylight<00:02:41.230> go<00:02:41.380> all

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
just you know have that skylight go all

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.020 
just you know have that skylight go all
the<00:02:41.620> way<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> way<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> bottom

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the way to the all the way to the bottom

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.930 
the way to the all the way to the bottom
so<00:02:43.420> that's<00:02:44.260> why<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.500> did<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.550> rings<00:02:45.820> in

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
so that's why I did that if it rings in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820 
so that's why I did that if it rings in
the<00:02:46.000> middle<00:02:46.270> I'll<00:02:46.780> keep<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.110> mind<00:02:47.350> when<00:02:47.680> don't

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
the middle I'll keep in mind when don't

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.690 
the middle I'll keep in mind when don't
we<00:02:47.860> go<00:02:48.010> through<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:50.700> everything

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
we go through this that everything

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.280 
we go through this that everything
everything<00:02:52.630> isn't<00:02:53.610> ideally<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.750> way<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
everything isn't ideally the way or the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.920 
everything isn't ideally the way or the
size<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.830> shape<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.459> should<00:02:58.450> be<00:02:58.630> or

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
size of the shape that it should be or

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.800 
size of the shape that it should be or
that<00:02:59.430> maybe<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.550> would<00:03:00.730> intend<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.330> be<00:03:01.450> but

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that maybe I would intend it to be but

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.190 
that maybe I would intend it to be but
because<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.980> confines<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.370> space<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
because of the confines of space you

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.110 
because of the confines of space you
know<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.560> made<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.459> best<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
know I made it the best way that I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.880 
know I made it the best way that I
thought<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.690> thought<00:03:08.260> would<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.590> appropriate

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
thought I thought would be appropriate

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.060 
thought I thought would be appropriate
for<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.280> location<00:03:10.500> some<00:03:11.500> chest<00:03:11.739> over<00:03:11.920> here

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070

Springs<00:03:23.560> crops<00:03:24.100> letters<00:03:25.090> when<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.019> comes<00:03:26.200> to

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
Springs crops letters when it comes to

Springs crops letters when it comes to
these<00:03:26.380> ladders<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.950> don't<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.550> it<00:03:27.760> when<00:03:27.790> they

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
these ladders I don't like it when they

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.850 
these ladders I don't like it when they
go<00:03:28.360> straight<00:03:28.690> down<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:29.050> that<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.260> think<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
go straight down like that I think I

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.220 
go straight down like that I think I
think<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:30.970> kind<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.209> hard<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.050> and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
think it's kind of hard to get on and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.960 
think it's kind of hard to get on and
off<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.350> them<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:32.920> that's<00:03:33.160> why<00:03:33.340> i<00:03:33.370> stagger<00:03:33.730> them

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
off of them so that's why i stagger them

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.560 
off of them so that's why i stagger them
like<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:35.280> back<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.310> here<00:03:36.610> come<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.150> here<00:03:37.269> you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
like that back in here come in here you

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.509 
like that back in here come in here you
can<00:03:37.720> harvest<00:03:37.930> from<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.380> middle<00:03:40.530> okay<00:03:41.530> second

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
can harvest from the middle okay second

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.800 
can harvest from the middle okay second
floor<00:03:42.640> third<00:03:42.880> floor

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.760 

same<00:03:46.810> thing<00:03:48.780> there's<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> 44<00:03:50.230> down<00:03:50.470> there<00:03:50.590> i'll

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
same thing there's a 44 down there i'll

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.170 
same thing there's a 44 down there i'll
get<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.370> second<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:51.880> i<00:03:51.940> wanted

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
get to that just a second but i wanted

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.870 
get to that just a second but i wanted
to<00:03:52.330> show<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:53.400> tunnel<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.490> i<00:03:54.580> talked<00:03:54.790> about

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
to show that tunnel that i talked about

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.470 
to show that tunnel that i talked about
getting<00:03:55.360> from<00:03:55.600> one<00:03:55.750> side<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.260> other<00:03:57.480> this

getting from one side to the other this
is<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.750> bottom<00:03:59.500> level<00:03:59.800> just<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.760> whacked<00:04:01.030> by

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
is the bottom level just so whacked by

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.650 
is the bottom level just so whacked by
crops<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.490> bottom<00:04:03.640> level<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.420> on

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.660 
this side don't want to talk about this
tunnel<00:04:07.330> going<00:04:07.930> through<00:04:08.260> here<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.400> wanted

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
tunnel going through here and I wanted

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.520 
tunnel going through here and I wanted
to<00:04:09.820> be<00:04:10.030> able<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.240> access<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:10.930> from<00:04:11.170> as<00:04:11.380> many

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
to be able to access this from as many

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.360 
to be able to access this from as many
points<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.130> could<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:14.950> bottom<00:04:15.220> level

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
points as I could and the bottom level

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.699 
points as I could and the bottom level
over<00:04:15.610> here<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:18.480> this<00:04:19.480> particular<00:04:19.900> level

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
over here and this particular level

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.270 
over here and this particular level
comes<00:04:21.670> out<00:04:21.970> naturally<00:04:25.830> over<00:04:26.830> here<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:27.220> I

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
comes out naturally over here so I

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.660 
comes out naturally over here so I
thought<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.520> was<00:04:27.640> kind<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:27.910> cool<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.620> then<00:04:30.160> I

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
thought that was kind of cool and then I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.160 
thought that was kind of cool and then I
need<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.910> go<00:04:31.090> for<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.330> bottom<00:04:31.510> level<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.020> this

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
need to go for that bottom level on this

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.520 
need to go for that bottom level on this
side<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:34.660> for<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.870> most<00:04:34.960> part<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:35.260> turned

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
side but for the most part just turned

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.430 
side but for the most part just turned
out<00:04:35.650> pretty<00:04:35.740> good<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.280> like<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.120> actually<00:04:38.050> no<00:04:38.200> it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
out pretty good I like it actually no it

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:47.150 
out pretty good I like it actually no it
wasn't<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.920> was<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.610> one<00:04:39.820> over<00:04:40.030> here

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.690 

and<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:48.480> last<00:04:48.750> one<00:04:48.900> over<00:04:49.230> here<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:50.490> was

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
and this last one over here this was

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.090 
and this last one over here this was
going<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.910> be<00:04:51.000> hard<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.390> get<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:52.440> stuff<00:04:52.980> in

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
going to be hard to get to the stuff in

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.630 
going to be hard to get to the stuff in
the<00:04:53.160> back<00:04:53.370> so<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:55.110> worse<00:04:56.010> comes<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.370> worse<00:04:56.610> than

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
the back so if worse comes to worse than

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.320 
the back so if worse comes to worse than
I<00:04:57.030> could<00:04:58.160> just<00:04:59.160> like<00:04:59.370> whack<00:04:59.610> out<00:04:59.820> these<00:05:00.000> three

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
I could just like whack out these three

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.980 
I could just like whack out these three
to<00:05:00.600> get<00:05:00.840> back<00:05:01.260> here<00:05:01.620> if<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.800> need<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.480> so<00:05:03.480> it's<00:05:03.720> a

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
to get back here if I need to so it's a

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.340 
to get back here if I need to so it's a
no<00:05:04.350> it's<00:05:04.530> not<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:05.190> best<00:05:05.370> but<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.870> know<00:05:07.140> that's

leave it as natural as I could so yeah I
could<00:05:23.580> have<00:05:24.230> carved<00:05:25.230> a<00:05:25.500> passageway<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.490> the

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
could have carved a passageway to the

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
could have carved a passageway to the
back<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.090> but<00:05:28.760> like<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:29.880> said<00:05:29.940> I'd<00:05:30.390> like<00:05:30.570> to

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
back of that but like I said I'd like to

back of that but like I said I'd like to
leave<00:05:30.720> these<00:05:31.050> things<00:05:31.290> as<00:05:31.500> natural<00:05:32.010> as<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.880> I

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
leave these things as natural as as I

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.710 
leave these things as natural as as I
can<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.540> let<00:05:34.380> my<00:05:34.500> ingenuity<00:05:35.330> come<00:05:36.330> up<00:05:36.540> with

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
can and let my ingenuity come up with

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.130 
can and let my ingenuity come up with
something<00:05:37.700> that<00:05:38.700> can<00:05:38.880> accommodate<00:05:39.780> the

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
something that can accommodate the

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.220 
something that can accommodate the
surroundings<00:05:40.650> so<00:05:41.420> anyway<00:05:42.420> I<00:05:42.600> just<00:05:42.720> can't<00:05:43.170> get

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
surroundings so anyway I just can't get

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.530 
surroundings so anyway I just can't get
over<00:05:43.290> that<00:05:43.440> skylight<00:05:43.950> that<00:05:44.070> is<00:05:44.190> really<00:05:44.430> cool

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
over that skylight that is really cool

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.750 
over that skylight that is really cool
so<00:05:45.540> anyway<00:05:45.810> that's<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.500> farm<00:05:46.770> system<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.250> I

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
so anyway that's the farm system and I

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.200 
so anyway that's the farm system and I
hope<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.150> guys<00:05:48.270> liked<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.660> video<00:05:48.750> take<00:05:49.170> care
