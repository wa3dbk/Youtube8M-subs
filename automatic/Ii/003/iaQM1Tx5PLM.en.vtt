 the area extracted you by pepper 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.320
 the skies and hawks and the denver broncos

 a hundred of possibilities of snow the 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.640
 denver broncos imposed the offensive 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.769
 most prolific in league history 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 and its game by air is fundamental 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.590
 for success 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.600
 peyman and threw 5 thousand 477 yards and 55 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.640
 scoring passes but the weather could 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 play against it mean and have a brand 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.410
 of 8 and 11 when participating in matches 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 with temperature of 4 degrees or less mean 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.129
 and it has a mark of 2 and 2 in all its 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 race against the seahawks and 1 and 1 in 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 super bowl games precisely in their 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 two games for the title has two 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 touchdowns and two interceptions city 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.420
 it was the best defensive unit in the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.910
 regular season and only allowed their 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.509
 rivals an average of 14.4 points per 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.799
 match the least amount in the whole nfl 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.530
 also the legion of the boom as they are made 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.720
 call forced 39 turnovers 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 more than the second in the nfc los san 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
 francisco by tim geither if the children 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.450
 they have all the players for 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 complicate maine and the key is to put 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 pressure to veteran quarterback 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 something that is much easier to say than 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 do 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 manning was captured only 18 times in 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.360
 the year and in the postseason has not yet 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.800
 been downed only once the accounts 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.270
 of live bets on point contain a 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.070
 the comfortable whites and nobody points 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.130
 favorites in the spread and the total 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 points is at 46 and a half this is one of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.970
 the most even duels of the superbowl in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.470
 all the last years after all 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.360
 they are the two best teams in the league 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.820
 however, take into account that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.890
 representatives of the nfc have covered the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.080
 spread in the last five of six 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.940
 super bowls that's why we're going to recommend 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.100

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.509
