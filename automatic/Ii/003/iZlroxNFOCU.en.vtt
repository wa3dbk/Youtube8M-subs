for<00:01:01.809> front<00:01:02.020> shove<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.530> most<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.430> time

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
for front shove and most of the time

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.340 
for front shove and most of the time
when<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.730> do<00:01:03.879> a<00:01:03.910> front<00:01:04.239> shove<00:01:04.509> it<00:01:04.720> catches<00:01:05.229> on

already<00:01:07.330> there<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.660> just<00:01:07.780> got<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.080> learn<00:01:08.200> the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
already there you just got to learn the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.290 
already there you just got to learn the
balance<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:08.890> when<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.160> put<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.460> down<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:13.119> a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
balance of when you put it down it's a

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.660 
balance of when you put it down it's a
front<00:01:13.570> shove<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:14.740> keep<00:01:15.009> your<00:01:15.160> foot<00:01:15.369> front

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
chug but most of the time I try to hang

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.249 
chug but most of the time I try to hang
out<00:01:18.070> my<00:01:18.220> toe<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.490> little<00:01:18.610> bit<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.929> just<00:01:20.110> has

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
out my toe a little bit so it just has

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.710 
out my toe a little bit so it just has
that<00:01:20.289> weird<00:01:20.770> leeway<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.759> when<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.030> when<00:01:22.630> you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
that weird leeway of when you when you

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.230 
that weird leeway of when you when you
front<00:01:23.110> shove<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:23.920> stays<00:01:24.460> right<00:01:24.880> above

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
front shove it just stays right above
