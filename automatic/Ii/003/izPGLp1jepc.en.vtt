00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
calendar because it says so little on

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
calendar because it says so little on
the<00:01:48.689> dial<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> hands<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the dial so you have the hands for the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
the dial so you have the hands for the
time<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> subsidiary<00:01:52.020> second<00:01:52.619> style

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
time you have a subsidiary second style

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
time you have a subsidiary second style
here<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> powers<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:54.299> indicator

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
here you have a powers over indicator

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
here you have a powers over indicator
here<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> date<00:01:55.829> okay<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
here and you have the date okay so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.770 
here and you have the date okay so
you're<00:01:56.670> asking<00:01:56.759> yourself<00:01:57.119> well<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> perpetual

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you're asking yourself well a perpetual

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
you're asking yourself well a perpetual
calendar<00:01:57.930> needs<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> indicate<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.189> than

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
calendar needs to indicate more than

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.459 
calendar needs to indicate more than
that<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.540> small<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.259> arrow

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that so you see that small little arrow

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.380 
that so you see that small little arrow
hand<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.759> actually<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
hand right there that's actually the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.319 
hand right there that's actually the
month<00:02:03.659> indicator<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.880> because<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.060> 12

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
month indicator and because there's 12

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.389 
month indicator and because there's 12
months<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.750> also<00:02:06.990> 12<00:02:07.229> hours<00:02:07.590> these

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
months and also 12 hours these

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.010 
months and also 12 hours these
indicators<00:02:09.060> around<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> hours

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
indicators around here for the hours

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.140 
indicators around here for the hours
also<00:02:10.410> doubles<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> month<00:02:11.129> indicator<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.000> it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
also doubles the month indicator so it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880 
also doubles the month indicator so it's
pointing<00:02:12.540> towards<00:02:12.780> 3<00:02:13.050> o'clock<00:02:13.349> which

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
pointing towards 3 o'clock which

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
pointing towards 3 o'clock which
would<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.490> third<00:02:14.760> month<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.240> year<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
would be the third month of the year and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.970 
would be the third month of the year and
that's<00:02:15.870> March<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> nice

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that's March and then you have a nice

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.250 
that's March and then you have a nice
date<00:02:17.700> indicated<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.810> basically<00:02:19.140> all

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
date indicated there so basically all

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
date indicated there so basically all
you<00:02:19.440> need<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.700> March<00:02:20.970> 6th<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
you need to know is it's March 6th to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
you need to know is it's March 6th to
tell<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.810> day<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.110> week<00:02:22.260> no<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:23.459> tell

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
tell you the day of the week no to tell

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.160 
tell you the day of the week no to tell
you<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.850> year<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.240> our<00:02:24.420> moon<00:02:24.569> phase<00:02:24.780> indicator

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
you the year is our moon phase indicator

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.620 
you the year is our moon phase indicator
no<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.340> basics<00:02:26.790> one<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> most

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
no it's just the basics one of the most

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
no it's just the basics one of the most
important<00:02:28.170> elements<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.950> perpetual

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
important elements of a perpetual

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.770 
important elements of a perpetual
calendar<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.330> takes<00:02:30.510> into<00:02:30.690> account

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
calendar is that it takes into account

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.510 
calendar is that it takes into account
the<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:33.000> difference<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.950> length<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.220> leap

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the the difference in length of leap

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.730 
the the difference in length of leap
years<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> back<00:02:37.500> of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
years so what you have on the back of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.190 
years so what you have on the back of
the<00:02:37.800> watch<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:39.209> small<00:02:39.570> little<00:02:39.810> dial

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the watch here is this small little dial

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.990 
the watch here is this small little dial
here<00:02:40.560> which<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.160> basically<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> leap<00:02:41.970> year

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
here which is basically the leap year

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.360 
here which is basically the leap year
indicator<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.840> tells<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.319> whether<00:02:44.160> in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
indicator and that tells you whether in

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
indicator and that tells you whether in
leap<00:02:44.700> year<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.750> February<00:02:46.500> is

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
leap year or not and if February is

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.580 
leap year or not and if February is
going<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:46.920> 28<00:02:47.459> days<00:02:47.520> or<00:02:48.030> 29<00:02:48.480> days<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
going to have 28 days or 29 days this is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
going to have 28 days or 29 days this is
something<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.100> don't<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.640> need<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
something that you don't really need to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.759 
something that you don't really need to
see<00:02:51.239> all<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.510> time<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.590> having

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
see all the time so I think that having

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.070 
see all the time so I think that having
it<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.250> back<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.700> watch<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:54.900> on

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it on the back of the watch you know on

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.390 
it on the back of the watch you know on
the<00:02:55.200> movement<00:02:55.680> makes<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.010> lot<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:56.220> sense

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the movement makes a lot more sense

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.130 
the movement makes a lot more sense
because<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:57.630> necessary

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
because it's just not really necessary

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
because it's just not really necessary
to<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.650> all<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.860> time<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.519> movement<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
to see all the time the movement is the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.930 
to see all the time the movement is the
in-house<00:03:00.600> made<00:03:00.950> HMC<00:03:01.950> caliber<00:03:02.489> three<00:03:03.209> four<00:03:03.989> one

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
in-house made HMC caliber three four one

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.830 
in-house made HMC caliber three four one
frequency<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.860> 18,000<00:03:07.860> beats<00:03:08.280> per<00:03:08.550> hour<00:03:08.840> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
frequency of 18,000 beats per hour and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.410 
frequency of 18,000 beats per hour and
it's<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.110> very<00:03:10.380> nice<00:03:10.590> long<00:03:11.100> pal<00:03:11.700> reserve<00:03:12.180> of

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's a very nice long pal reserve of

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.199 
it's a very nice long pal reserve of
seven<00:03:13.320> days<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.830> full<00:03:14.190> week<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.519> powers<00:03:14.850> or<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
seven days a full week of powers or is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.120 
seven days a full week of powers or is
fantastic<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.800> I've<00:03:16.890> been<00:03:17.010> able

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
fantastic and I like that I've been able

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.490 
fantastic and I like that I've been able
to<00:03:17.280> sort<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.580> put<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.180> watch<00:03:18.450> down<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.170> then

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
to sort of put this watch down and then

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.590 
to sort of put this watch down and then
pick<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.430> know<00:03:20.579> days<00:03:20.880> later<00:03:21.239> and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
pick it up you know days later and

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.030 
pick it up you know days later and
there's<00:03:21.900> still<00:03:22.110> plenty<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.500> powers<00:03:22.890> of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
there's still plenty of powers of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.069 
there's still plenty of powers of
reserve<00:03:23.640> left<00:03:23.910> that's<00:03:24.329> good<00:03:24.630> because<00:03:24.780> when

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
reserve left that's good because when

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.110 
reserve left that's good because when
you<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> perpetual<00:03:26.010> calendar<00:03:26.190> watch<00:03:26.579> you

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
you have a perpetual calendar watch you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.539 
you have a perpetual calendar watch you
don't<00:03:27.360> want<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.870> have<00:03:28.049> something<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
don't want to have something that the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.100 
don't want to have something that the
power<00:03:29.760> runs<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.299> very<00:03:30.540> easily<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:31.079> quickly

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
power runs out very easily or quickly

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.960 
power runs out very easily or quickly
because<00:03:31.920> then<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.130> becomes<00:03:32.220> very<00:03:32.519> annoying<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
because then it becomes very annoying to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.900 
because then it becomes very annoying to
have<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> set<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> time<00:03:33.959> especially

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
have to set it all the time especially

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.910 
have to set it all the time especially
in<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.940> situation<00:03:36.660> where<00:03:37.049> it's<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.650> perpetual

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
in a situation where it's a perpetual

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.170 
in a situation where it's a perpetual
calendar<00:03:38.430> because<00:03:38.610> there's<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.090> many

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
calendar because there's just so many

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.610 
calendar because there's just so many
little<00:03:39.269> things<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.690> do<00:03:39.810> one<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> best

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
little things to do one of the best

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.740 
little things to do one of the best
things<00:03:40.860> about<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.250> movement<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
things about this movement is that the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.650 
things about this movement is that the
perpetual<00:03:43.230> calendar<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:44.400> be<00:03:44.610> adjusted<00:03:45.209> both

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
perpetual calendar can be adjusted both

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.949 
perpetual calendar can be adjusted both
both<00:03:46.170> forward<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.239> backwards<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.420> time<00:03:48.600> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
both forward and backwards in time and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.380 
both forward and backwards in time and
it's<00:03:49.320> very<00:03:49.380> satisfying<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.459> do<00:03:50.579> so<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.269> can

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it's very satisfying to do so so you can

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.569 
it's very satisfying to do so so you can
basically<00:03:51.660> change<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> date<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.890> move<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
basically change the date and move it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.060 
basically change the date and move it
forward<00:03:53.730> or<00:03:53.940> backwards<00:03:54.360> very<00:03:54.660> easily<00:03:55.070> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
forward or backwards very easily and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.199 
forward or backwards very easily and
that<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.459> definitely<00:03:56.790> another

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
that is definitely another

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.150 
that is definitely another
distinguishing<00:03:57.720> factor<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.130> lot

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
distinguishing factor that I like a lot

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.979 
distinguishing factor that I like a lot
so<00:03:59.459> let's<00:03:59.640> see<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.940> nice<00:04:00.540> endeavor

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
so let's see this nice endeavor

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.680 
so let's see this nice endeavor
perpetual<00:04:01.530> calendar<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.850> wrist<00:04:03.120> this

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
perpetual calendar on the wrist this

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.160 
perpetual calendar on the wrist this
actually<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.410> not<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.730> stock<00:04:06.510> strap<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.110> is

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
actually is not the stock strap this is

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.380 
actually is not the stock strap this is
for<00:04:07.860> this<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.160> because<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.970> importation

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
for this is because for importation

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.960 
for this is because for importation
purposes<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.470> fake<00:04:10.970> alligator

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
purposes this is that fake alligator

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.060 
purposes this is that fake alligator
strap<00:04:12.269> because<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.540> real<00:04:13.019> alligator<00:04:13.320> strap<00:04:13.859> for

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
strap because a real alligator strap for

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.569 
strap because a real alligator strap for
importation<00:04:14.519> purposes<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.620> pain<00:04:16.620> when<00:04:17.310> when

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
importation purposes is a pain when when

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.490 
importation purposes is a pain when when
bringing<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.880> United<00:04:18.150> States<00:04:18.359> for<00:04:18.959> well<00:04:19.229> for

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
bringing the United States for well for

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.690 
bringing the United States for well for
good<00:04:19.650> reasons<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.310> makes<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.519> difficult

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
good reasons but it makes it difficult

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.590 
good reasons but it makes it difficult
anyhow

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
anyhow

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.469 
anyhow
so<00:04:22.260> there<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.610> wrist<00:04:23.789> just<00:04:24.210> about

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
so there it is on the wrist just about

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.630 
so there it is on the wrist just about
41<00:04:24.870> millimeters<00:04:25.289> wide<00:04:25.500> as<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:26.250> know<00:04:26.400> there's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
41 millimeters wide as you know there's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.710 
41 millimeters wide as you know there's
various<00:04:26.970> different

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
various different

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.420 
various different
versions<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.440> perpetual<00:04:28.920> calendar<00:04:29.280> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
versions of the perpetual calendar so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.310 
versions of the perpetual calendar so
this<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.850> rose<00:04:30.150> gold<00:04:30.180> case<00:04:30.750> with<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
this is the rose gold case with the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.070 
this is the rose gold case with the
black<00:04:31.530> dial<00:04:31.890> there's<00:04:32.600> there's<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.660> titanium

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
black dial there's there's a titanium

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.350 
black dial there's there's a titanium
one<00:04:34.500> that's<00:04:34.740> deal<00:04:34.950> that's<00:04:35.250> DLC<00:04:35.940> coated<00:04:36.240> black

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
one that's deal that's DLC coated black

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.880 
one that's deal that's DLC coated black
I<00:04:36.540> believe<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:36.900> DLC<00:04:37.170> code<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.440> was<00:04:37.560> black

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
I believe it's DLC code it was black

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.220 
I believe it's DLC code it was black
coda<00:04:38.190> case<00:04:38.370> there's<00:04:38.850> smoked<00:04:39.450> dials<00:04:39.960> they<00:04:40.050> call

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
coda case there's smoked dials they call

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.800 
coda case there's smoked dials they call
the<00:04:40.380> fumet<00:04:40.860> dials<00:04:41.400> there's<00:04:41.910> different

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
the fumet dials there's different

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.180 
the fumet dials there's different
materials<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> think<00:04:43.470> there's<00:04:43.710> white<00:04:43.890> gold

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
materials so I think there's white gold

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.220 
materials so I think there's white gold
so<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:45.150> know<00:04:45.180> there's<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:45.480> lot<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.750> variety

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
so I you know there's a lot of variety

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.840 
so I you know there's a lot of variety
and<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.070> for<00:04:47.430> me

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
and this is this is for me

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.600 
and this is this is for me
HMOs<00:04:48.420> are<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.660> C's<00:04:48.810> flagship<00:04:49.770> watch<00:04:50.010> one<00:04:50.520> of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
HMOs are and C's flagship watch one of

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.300 
HMOs are and C's flagship watch one of
the<00:04:50.670> issues<00:04:51.060> I<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.210> with<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.570> dial<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:52.310> that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the issues I have with the dial is that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.400 
the issues I have with the dial is that
it<00:04:53.400> becomes<00:04:53.760> relatively<00:04:54.270> illegible<00:04:55.050> in

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it becomes relatively illegible in

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.620 
it becomes relatively illegible in
certain<00:04:56.220> lights<00:04:56.490> there's<00:04:56.820> no<00:04:57.000> loom<00:04:57.390> or

certain lights there's no loom or

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.690 
certain lights there's no loom or
anything<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.590> all<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.220> elements

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
anything like that and all the elements

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.920 
anything like that and all the elements
are<00:04:59.790> polished<00:05:00.240> when<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:00.480> have<00:05:00.570> polished

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
are polished when you have polished

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.780 
are polished when you have polished
elements<00:05:01.470> it<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:02.010> look<00:05:02.130> great<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.520> some

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
elements it can look great in some

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.160 
elements it can look great in some
lights<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.540> you<00:05:03.660> look<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:04.020> different

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
lights but you look in a different

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.020 
lights but you look in a different
lighting<00:05:04.680> like<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.670> becomes<00:05:05.940> very

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
lighting like that and it becomes very

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.180 
lighting like that and it becomes very

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
uncommon for H Moser and see there's

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.830 
uncommon for H Moser and see there's
lots<00:05:11.250> of<00:05:11.460> brands<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.000> happens<00:05:12.390> too<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.720> it's

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
lots of brands this happens too and it's

lots of brands this happens too and it's
quite<00:05:13.020> unfortunate<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.980> some<00:05:14.430> brands

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
quite unfortunate that some brands

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.180 
quite unfortunate that some brands
aren't<00:05:14.970> able<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.440> create<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.470> dial<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.920> you

future is spend a little bit more time
with<00:05:32.460> AR<00:05:33.120> coating<00:05:33.540> on<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.750> crystal<00:05:34.140> there<00:05:34.440> is

with AR coating on the crystal there is
some<00:05:34.830> AR<00:05:35.100> coating<00:05:35.460> but<00:05:35.550> as<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.700> can<00:05:35.790> see

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
some AR coating but as you can see

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.030 
some AR coating but as you can see
there's<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.630> lot<00:05:36.780> of<00:05:36.870> reflectivity<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.740> that's

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
there's a lot of reflectivity and that's

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.500 
there's a lot of reflectivity and that's
also<00:05:38.340> one<00:05:38.490> of<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.610> elements<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.150> makes<00:05:39.360> it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
also one of the elements that makes it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.900 
also one of the elements that makes it
difficult<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:40.230> read<00:05:40.620> in<00:05:40.890> some<00:05:41.070> instances<00:05:41.490> but

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
difficult to read in some instances but

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.909 
difficult to read in some instances but
overall<00:05:42.210> this<00:05:42.630> is<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.840> really<00:05:43.140> nice<00:05:43.320> watch<00:05:43.560> it's

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
overall this is a really nice watch it's

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.040 
overall this is a really nice watch it's
very<00:05:44.100> elegant<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:45.090> really<00:05:45.360> appreciate<00:05:45.840> the

a long power sort of time just a lot of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.490 
a long power sort of time just a lot of
good<00:06:00.180> stuff<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.570> I<00:06:00.660> think<00:06:00.720> that<00:06:00.990> H<00:06:01.110> Moser<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
good stuff and I think that H Moser and

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.370 
good stuff and I think that H Moser and
C<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:02.490> really<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.330> type<00:06:03.510> of<00:06:03.540> brand<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.050> is

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
C is really the type of brand that is

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.409 
C is really the type of brand that is
interesting<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:04.950> offers<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.520> good<00:06:06.060> amount<00:06:06.360> for

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
interesting and offers a good amount for

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.930 
interesting and offers a good amount for
the<00:06:06.630> money<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.990> don't<00:06:07.140> have<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.680> precise<00:06:08.160> price

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
