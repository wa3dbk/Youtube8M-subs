00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.850
 the battle between playstation 4 and xbox 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.250
 one continues but this time not 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.500
 we go with an attack but with a new 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.480
 sample of support and cleaning in this 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.220
 battle by microsoft 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.220
 phil spencer one of the main 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.310
 Microsoft executives has used the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.250
 speaker of the official xbox magazine 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.500
 USA to review the news 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.210
 of the video game and attentive to the words 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.490
 that he has left because the truth is that he has 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.980
 talked pretty good about sonny and about 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.860
 all of playstation 4 says sonny and me 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.780
 center in the first party part because it's 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 what I dedicate myself to deserves all my 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.910
 respect for your way of focusing on 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.399
 new things and creative things that have 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.040
 made with david cage and quantic dream with 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.410
 games like heavy rain or beyond that 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 commitment to franchises that do not sell 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.610
 10 million units I think the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.890
 long- term commitment to 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.710
 Franchising is important it's easy 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.260
 forget about a brand and take the step to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.340
 the next thing if it does not sell I would say that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 They have done a good job with 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.760
 playstation 4 when I think of his 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.370
 announcement I see it clear 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.430
 focused on the consumer led by 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.380
 a proposal of great value on what 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.790
 they tried to achieve are faithful to a 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.280
 vision I think they have made a good 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.770
 work when defining your console 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.420
 he has also had words for nintendo 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.980
 that the truth is that in those moments 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 you know it's a company that does not 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.370
 It's going well, well, attentive 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
 because it says about nintendo I think that 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.410
 they have things clear I think they have 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 incredible things in your material first 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 party your studies and ips first party 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.170
 they can lead what they do as 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.570
 company and its platforms are at 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.970
 service of the ips have great 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.130
 iconic intellectual properties and 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.920
 this may seem unrelated 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.810
 but when we came back and did something like 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.120
 killer instinct a bit of history 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.580
 of your franchise can be important 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.070
 that people feel connected to it 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.160
 obviously the history of that brand does not 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.140
 xbox but it is wrong and I think 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.540
 that reaction when we announce it in 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.880
 the e3 showed that nintendo was linked 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.900
 with the heart of curious people the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.180
 comparative he has made between 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.890
 let's say the tie that the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.470
 nintendo fans to the games of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 Nintendo and what happened in the past e3 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.079
 with that title killer instinct for xbox 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.909
 one is curious in any case there 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.890
 We see some new statements by 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.560
 part of microsoft it looks like they do not want 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.209
 war they want peace will be some kind 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.609
 of business strategy in any 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.379
 case applause to these words because 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.640
 Of course it is also good that there 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.640
 peace between companies
