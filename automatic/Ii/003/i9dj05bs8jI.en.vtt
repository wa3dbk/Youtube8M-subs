00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 I saw on the way out and we did not even 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.210
 not the addition 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.240
 it's not because the president 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.160
 sambi what they do there differently is 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.369
 what the president told us it's 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 that the god president asks him you have 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.539
 left our shop not to do 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.359
 to reach togo and Togolese 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.630
 do everything to make the gta sargos lamy 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.910
 and proportional month it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 take over while the election 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.800
 a contest a week say you do not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.170
 will not be toying the heads of state 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 for ten years they are actually 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.960
 complicated said that we resume work 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.850
 we'll see how it's going to end 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.449
 but what can I say mom I'm scared 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.899
 conflicts not a report 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.570
 so far with figures falling 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.900
 what is it that makes us 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.320
 everything to be able to adjust the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 problem 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 the chairman of the commune of the committee 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 accompaniment of young people in galley 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.140
 made several proposals that are 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.820
 defeated g or in the example of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.080
 ra ra said we have the record of the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 wind us and to some members and not 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.260
 not signed this poster there is a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.500
 unsigned member this sheet is the 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.180
 reason is that we asked 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.950
 hastily little the report arrives at 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.619
 lomÃ© and people have led to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.560
 niamtougou airport and what 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.840
 looks like Rhone still denied and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 the others not six but what is 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.810
 extraordinary is that we have 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.080
 found the president of the ceni who has 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.840
 told us that we have found goals of 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.060
 debility besides the goals and that we 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.979
 have authenticated time of a god when 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.310
 we did the compilation what makes 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.420
 that there is something happened 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.700
 so we asked to know 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.400
 more or to use everyone but 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.910
 unfortunately so far we 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.180
 have no solution it's on these 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 blockages there that we will do but if 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.799
 the cedeao tells us to finish 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 like that and art to send had we 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.220
 are going to send ya even had a threat to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.829
 the is the threat which the one who would have 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.150
 sufficiently block the situation for 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:52.269
 that the togo room this one there will be 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.799
 investigations for the punit it was clear 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:59.489
 like ours you understand you are 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.720
 journalists I said I respect 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.610
 of the two presidents who came who 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.870
 are very good chair to that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.700
