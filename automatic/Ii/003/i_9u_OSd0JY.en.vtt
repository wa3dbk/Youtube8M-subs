he's trained to give a passive

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.910 
he's trained to give a passive
indication<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.149> he<00:00:55.300> doesn't<00:00:55.570> interfere<00:00:55.920> with

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
indication so he doesn't interfere with

in these days of while you've always had
the<00:01:03.640> fingerprint<00:01:04.119> side<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.839> things<00:01:04.989> yeah<00:01:05.490> but

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
the fingerprint side of things yeah but

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.020 
the fingerprint side of things yeah but
we<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.030> DNA<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:09.130> sort<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.399> thing<00:01:09.490> now

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
we have DNA and this sort of thing now

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.320 
we have DNA and this sort of thing now
so<00:01:10.840> they<00:01:11.560> don't<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:12.549> hope<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.820> dog<00:01:13.000> was<00:01:13.180> to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
so they don't we hope the dog was to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.060 
so they don't we hope the dog was to
pick<00:01:13.509> yes<00:01:14.049> something<00:01:14.380> like<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.530> wallet<00:01:14.950> up

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
pick yes something like a wallet up

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.830 
pick yes something like a wallet up
particularly<00:01:15.399> instead<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.090> chewing<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.600> and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
particularly instead of chewing it and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.039 
particularly instead of chewing it and
this<00:01:17.320> sort<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.619> thing<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:19.690> doesn't<00:01:19.960> make

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
this sort of thing it it doesn't make

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.870 
this sort of thing it it doesn't make
their<00:01:20.259> job<00:01:20.530> any<00:01:20.710> easier<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:21.430> covered<00:01:21.820> in

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
their job any easier it's covered in

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.609 
their job any easier it's covered in
dogs<00:01:22.149> not<00:01:22.390> ahem<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.819> you<00:01:24.819> know<00:01:25.440> some<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
dogs not ahem so you know some of the

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.190 
dogs not ahem so you know some of the
dogs<00:01:26.830> are<00:01:27.009> trained<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.780> indicate<00:01:28.780> passively

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
dogs are trained to indicate passively

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.059 
dogs are trained to indicate passively
so<00:01:30.100> like<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.850> stopped<00:01:31.119> over<00:01:31.360> the

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
so like that it's stopped over the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.380 
so like that it's stopped over the
bridge<00:01:33.069> flaw<00:01:33.310> yeah<00:01:33.789> and<00:01:34.920> indicate<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.950> min<00:01:36.399> then

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
bridge flaw yeah and indicate a min then

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.169 
bridge flaw yeah and indicate a min then
that's<00:01:37.899> where<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.550> some<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.700> them<00:01:39.759> will<00:01:39.970> say

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
that's where it is some of them will say

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.260 
that's where it is some of them will say
to<00:01:40.240> people<00:01:40.780> lie<00:01:40.929> down<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:42.039> know<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.369> if

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
to people lie down you know and if

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.359 
to people lie down you know and if
that's<00:01:43.509> what<00:01:43.659> they're<00:01:44.049> happy<00:01:44.440> doing<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.250> when

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
that's what they're happy doing and when

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.010 
that's what they're happy doing and when
you<00:01:45.490> try<00:01:45.729> all<00:01:45.909> these<00:01:46.149> things<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.750> find

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you try all these things and you find

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.660 
you try all these things and you find
out<00:01:47.140> what<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.409> dog<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.619> happy<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.100> doing<00:01:48.399> yeah

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
out what the dog is happy is doing yeah

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.910 
out what the dog is happy is doing yeah
and<00:01:48.970> if<00:01:49.119> they<00:01:49.270> readily<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.200> then<00:01:50.679> there's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
and if they readily do that then there's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.920 
and if they readily do that then there's
no<00:01:51.039> point<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.369> changing<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:54.719> his<00:01:55.719> reaction

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
no point in changing it his reaction

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.709 
no point in changing it his reaction
just<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:56.969> hmm<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.149> first<00:01:58.390> time<00:01:58.570> he<00:01:58.689> came

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
just there hmm the first time he came

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.929 
just there hmm the first time he came
round<00:01:59.140> because<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.310> word<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> way<00:02:00.789> the

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
round because the word the way the

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.779 
round because the word the way the
breeze<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.420> coming<00:02:01.979> he<00:02:02.979> wasn't<00:02:03.340> even<00:02:03.430> far

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
breeze is coming he wasn't even far

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.420 
breeze is coming he wasn't even far
enough<00:02:04.090> to<00:02:04.840> actually<00:02:04.990> pick<00:02:05.320> up<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.619> scent<00:02:05.799> but

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
enough to actually pick up the scent but

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.949 
enough to actually pick up the scent but
as<00:02:06.579> soon<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:06.909> he<00:02:07.030> went<00:02:07.270> past<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.869> time<00:02:09.959> he

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
as soon as he went past that time he

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.440 
as soon as he went past that time he

went into this corner site and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.229 
went into this corner site and
immediately<00:02:13.840> stopped<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.700> turned

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
immediately stopped and then turned

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.949 
immediately stopped and then turned
round<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.880> know<00:02:18.940> an<00:02:19.090> indicator<00:02:19.540> where<00:02:19.810> it

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
round you know an indicator where it

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.979 
round you know an indicator where it

so what that proves in a census lady
doesn't<00:03:32.180> do<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.510> just<00:03:32.720> by<00:03:32.900> our<00:03:32.959> eyesight<00:03:33.440> but

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
doesn't do it just by our eyesight but

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.650 
doesn't do it just by our eyesight but
because<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.280> wind<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.670> gonna<00:03:35.000> cross<00:03:35.360> word
