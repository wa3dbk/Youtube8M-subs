00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.910
 thanks to jolie and we were doing the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.080
 makeup course with me and I do not speak 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.180
 of the products after a lot of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.280
 products and good appeared interesting 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.569
 I went to the lido which was much more centered 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.569
 from my house there in the inah 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.560
 to be a leader as I lived it affected 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.810
 went to america 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.780
 good 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 in the interior of the country I'm sorry girls 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.450
 maybe winning by 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 by the knee of venezuela knee 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.760
 christian and I went and bought lipstick and 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.490
 long duration 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 excellent I bought a long tombstone 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.550
 duration 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.550
 I did not like it, they do not know what depends 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.140
 of eyes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.790
 excellent products but I discovered a 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.650
 lots of things and we believe that the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 masks and I fell in love in the part 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.650
 later 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.049
 this this 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.110
 Y 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.400
 real 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:08.180
 another thing is that you arrive and you see the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.870
 fridge 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.609
 to leave 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.919
 and we put them like that is for example 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:30.340
 He usually speaks them when he makes you 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.340
 some invasive treatment 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.570
 he really looks that way and spooky 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:49.460
 total because you see it here it says how much of 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.460
 15 to 20 minutes generally 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.950
 He says 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.259
 if it comes as a liquid bed perhaps 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.259
 Retract with justice 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.660
 I recommend you 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 masks 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.500
 as it is 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.550
 I prefer this you after the 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.500
 peeling that I do to eliminate the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.780
 dead cells and that when we go in 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.630
 a much deeper cleaning 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.460
 homemade by the ampa makes a good 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.530
 cleaning this is a good collection is 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.889
 a chemical peel and then seal with 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:17.500
 this brand of course that 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:20.700
 but for example I say for home 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.410
 I wash my face with a sponge 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.300
 sevilla that next I bring it is 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.900
 excellent to clean the creation of 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.330
 police micros and then he places you with 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.970
 mask 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.250
 but ideally to absorb all the 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.910
 nutrients as is my colleague the 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.940
 partner that is this 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.690
 to become free 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.540
 good girl is super casual is this 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.980
 video is more expensive washed as it is 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.330
 they had and now now if this is for 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.160
 you do your treatments and 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.020
 skin care anyway no 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.510
 they substitute for nothing a good cleaning 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.150
 with a dermatologist as a committed logo 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.550
 professional beautician but it is always 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.130
 good to be cariÃ±itos at home remember 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.890
 if they have an important event do not do 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.630
 do not do it on a hairstyle the day before 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.340
 these are things that do not have to be done 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.800
 with a lot of anticipation because one does not 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.230
 know if you do not have an allergic reaction or 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.870
 They do not do well, it is not always expected 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.700
 week before for this one foresee any 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.470
 eventuality thank you very much for 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.060

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.660
