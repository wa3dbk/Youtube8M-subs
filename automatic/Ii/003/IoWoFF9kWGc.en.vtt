nothing<00:00:14.340> too<00:00:15.000> good<00:00:15.330> i<00:00:15.360> would<00:00:15.750> say<00:00:15.960> i<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.109> say

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
nothing too good i would say i would say

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.349 
nothing too good i would say i would say
Swagger's<00:00:17.220> coming<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.670> party<00:00:17.880> would<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Swagger's coming out party would be a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.880 
Swagger's coming out party would be a
good<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.080> describe<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.710> pay-per-view

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
good way to describe this pay-per-view

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.370 
good way to describe this pay-per-view
but<00:00:20.760> other<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.150> rock<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.840> punk<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.350> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
but other than that rock and punk was I

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
but other than that rock and punk was I
think<00:00:22.920> fell<00:00:23.130> flat<00:00:23.900> Elimination<00:00:24.900> Chamber

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
think fell flat Elimination Chamber

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.720 
think fell flat Elimination Chamber
match<00:00:25.199> was<00:00:25.470> good<00:00:25.650> well<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.310> said<00:00:26.369> Jack

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
match was good well like I said Jack

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.480 
match was good well like I said Jack
Swagger's<00:00:27.090> coming-out<00:00:27.420> party<00:00:27.750> um<00:00:28.490> but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
Swagger's coming-out party um but

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.919 
Swagger's coming-out party um but
everything<00:00:29.880> else<00:00:30.029> even<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> shield<00:00:30.750> match

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
everything else even the shield match

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.350 
everything else even the shield match
was<00:00:31.170> good<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> most<00:00:32.369> part<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
was good for the most part but I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
was good for the most part but I
wouldn't<00:00:33.780> say<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.380> good<00:00:34.800> i<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> TLC

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
wouldn't say was good i think the TLC

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
wouldn't say was good i think the TLC
match<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.000> always<00:00:36.239> stand<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> one

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
match will always stand out as the one

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.920 
match will always stand out as the one
of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> better<00:00:37.620> matches<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> uh<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.660> shield

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
of the better matches that uh the shield

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410 
of the better matches that uh the shield
and<00:00:40.110> even<00:00:40.350> Ryback<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.920> been<00:00:41.190> part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and even Ryback have been part of but

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
and even Ryback have been part of but
i'm<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.530> match<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.980> match

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
i'm not going to go match my match

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
i'm not going to go match my match
because<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.640> everything<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.590> okay

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
because really everything was just okay

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.790 
because really everything was just okay
too<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.329> bad<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.260> quite<00:00:49.379> honest

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
too pretty pretty bad to be quite honest

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.720 
too pretty pretty bad to be quite honest
up<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.670> example<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> Cesaro<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.170> ms<00:00:52.469> match<00:00:52.730> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
up for example the Cesaro in ms match it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.779 
up for example the Cesaro in ms match it
was<00:00:53.940> slow<00:00:54.180> pace<00:00:54.570> nothing<00:00:55.530> too<00:00:55.739> good<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> then

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
was slow pace nothing too good and then

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
was slow pace nothing too good and then
the<00:00:56.879> ending<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.750> fell<00:00:58.140> made<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the ending kind of just fell made it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.150 
the ending kind of just fell made it
even<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> whatever<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.859> but<00:01:01.859> like

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
like a really a bigger dweeb n.e.r.d is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
like a really a bigger dweeb n.e.r.d is
Kalin<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.790> Tamina<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.390> very<00:01:15.930> weird<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Kalin and Tamina was very weird the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
Kalin and Tamina was very weird the
Elimination<00:01:19.830> Chamber<00:01:20.009> match<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
Elimination Chamber match I think is

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.190 
Elimination Chamber match I think is
really<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> only<00:01:21.180> thing<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.080> out

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
really the only thing to really go out

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800 
really the only thing to really go out
of<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.350> way<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:23.180> but<00:01:24.180> rock<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> punk

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of your way and see but rock and punk

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
of your way and see but rock and punk
was<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> more<00:01:25.650> surprising<00:01:26.310> mattress

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
was one of the more surprising mattress

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
was one of the more surprising mattress
I<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.360> did<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.829> they

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I really did think that you know they

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.700 
I really did think that you know they
told<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.220> good<00:01:29.340> story<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> beginning<00:01:30.119> but

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
told a good story at the beginning but

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
told a good story at the beginning but
just<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> rest<00:01:32.040> holds<00:01:32.400> were<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.790> long<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
just the rest holds were so long and you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.010 
just the rest holds were so long and you
just<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.020> bored<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> um<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just got so bored of it and um and the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.890 
just got so bored of it and um and the
ending<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.680> did<00:01:37.860> expect<00:01:38.189> something

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
ending I really did expect something

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.880 
ending I really did expect something
monumental<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> happen<00:01:40.350> considering<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
monumental to happen considering that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
monumental to happen considering that
stipulation<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> was

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
stipulation was on there but it was

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
stipulation was on there but it was
really<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.740> referee<00:01:43.740> gets<00:01:43.890> knocked<00:01:44.100> down

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
really just referee gets knocked down

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
really just referee gets knocked down
punk<00:01:45.090> goes<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> hit<00:01:45.540> rock<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> belt<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
punk goes to hit rock with the belt and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.980 
punk goes to hit rock with the belt and
I<00:01:46.790> think<00:01:47.790> he<00:01:47.850> won<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> rock<00:01:48.329> bottom<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I think he won with a rock bottom and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
I think he won with a rock bottom and
that<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.850> nothing<00:01:50.850> too<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:53.060> I'm

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that was it nothing too good but I'm
