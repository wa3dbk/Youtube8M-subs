00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
the Warlock Water Tribe design is pretty

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.330 
the Warlock Water Tribe design is pretty
nice<00:00:27.670> it's<00:00:28.240> pretty<00:00:28.600> comfortable<00:00:29.140> overall<00:00:29.650> but

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
nice it's pretty comfortable overall but

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.370 
nice it's pretty comfortable overall but
the<00:00:30.430> only<00:00:30.550> use<00:00:30.730> that<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:30.910> have<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.630> not<00:00:31.840> very

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
the only use that I have it's not very

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.160 
the only use that I have it's not very
balanced<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.280> for<00:00:33.489> example<00:00:34.060> you<00:00:34.900> know<00:00:35.020> the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
balanced so for example you know the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.170 
balanced so for example you know the
most<00:00:35.350> comfortably<00:00:35.890> position<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:36.820> have<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
most comfortably position is to have the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.930 
most comfortably position is to have the
neck<00:00:37.450> a<00:00:37.690> little<00:00:37.989> bit<00:00:38.110> tilted<00:00:38.440> like<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:39.070> but

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
neck a little bit tilted like that but

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.299 
neck a little bit tilted like that but
that's<00:00:40.809> not<00:00:41.020> a<00:00:41.050> default<00:00:41.500> position<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:42.160> I

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
that's not a default position if I

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.830 
that's not a default position if I
release<00:00:42.610> my<00:00:42.850> hands<00:00:43.270> will<00:00:43.480> fall<00:00:43.750> like<00:00:44.080> this

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.020 

so<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:48.770> is<00:00:48.890> not<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.370> most<00:00:49.550> comfortable

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
so this is not the most comfortable

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.700 
so this is not the most comfortable
position<00:00:50.240> you<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.930> play<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.290> little<00:00:51.590> bit

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
position you have to play a little bit

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.380

the guitar is not broken this is a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.610 
the guitar is not broken this is a
common<00:02:18.400> behavior<00:02:18.910> if<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> Freud<00:02:20.380> Rose

the tremolo bar and you're gonna notice
the<00:02:24.820> same<00:02:25.060> behavior<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.770> what<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.160> what

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
the same behavior so what this is what

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.280 
the same behavior so what this is what
happens<00:02:30.700> when<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.420> dive<00:02:31.720> off<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.050> tremolo

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
happens when you dive off the tremolo

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.550 
happens when you dive off the tremolo
bar<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.190> release<00:02:33.490> many<00:02:33.940> pounds<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.450> pressure

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
bar you release many pounds of pressure

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.900 
bar you release many pounds of pressure
against<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.590> locky<00:02:35.860> not<00:02:36.190> coming<00:02:36.610> from<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
against the locky not coming from the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.000 
against the locky not coming from the
strings<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.290> when<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.560> return<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
strings so and when you return the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.370 
strings so and when you return the
tremolo<00:02:39.250> bar<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> default<00:02:40.300> position<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
tremolo bar to the default position you

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.740 
tremolo bar to the default position you
bring<00:02:41.620> back<00:02:41.890> all<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.190> string<00:02:42.730> tension<00:02:43.000> so

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
bring back all the string tension so

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.480 
bring back all the string tension so
that's<00:02:44.080> why<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.320> see<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.800> wood<00:02:44.980> movie<00:02:47.490> so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
that's why you see the wood movie so

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.270 
that's why you see the wood movie so
therefore<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.570> two<00:02:49.810> screws<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.590> attach<00:02:50.770> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
therefore the two screws that attach the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
therefore the two screws that attach the
lucky<00:02:51.520> nut<00:02:51.850> should<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.209> neck<00:02:52.420> must<00:02:52.930> be<00:02:53.170> tight

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
lucky nut should the neck must be tight

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.010 
lucky nut should the neck must be tight
and<00:02:53.860> nicely<00:02:54.489> drill<00:02:54.730> otherwise<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.540> lucky<00:02:55.750> not

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
and nicely drill otherwise the lucky not

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.080 
and nicely drill otherwise the lucky not
to<00:02:56.080> move<00:02:56.350> back<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.620> forth<00:02:57.070> even<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.910> can

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
to move back and forth even if you can

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.550 
to move back and forth even if you can
see<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> because<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.900> know<00:02:59.020> sometimes<00:02:59.410> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
see it because you know sometimes you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.940 
see it because you know sometimes you
can<00:02:59.770> notice<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.580> lucky<00:03:00.820> nut<00:03:01.090> movie<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:02.260> this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
can notice the lucky nut movie so this

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.400 
can notice the lucky nut movie so this
