00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
it's a white huge franchise stuff one of

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.120 
it's a white huge franchise stuff one of
the<00:01:39.969> last<00:01:40.119> times<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.570> was<00:01:40.720> there<00:01:40.990> well<00:01:41.679> honestly

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
the last times I was there well honestly

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.819 
the last times I was there well honestly
I'm<00:01:42.369> really<00:01:42.579> not<00:01:42.850> sure<00:01:42.909> what<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:44.079> expect<00:01:44.110> as

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
I'm really not sure what to expect as

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.590 
I'm really not sure what to expect as
far<00:01:44.860> as<00:01:45.130> content<00:01:45.549> goes<00:01:45.759> while<00:01:45.939> I'm<00:01:46.030> gone<00:01:46.270> I'll

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
far as content goes while I'm gone I'll

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.410 
far as content goes while I'm gone I'll
be<00:01:46.750> gone<00:01:46.929> from<00:01:47.380> today<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:48.069> 23rd<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:49.119> I<00:01:49.179> get

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
be gone from today the 23rd and I get

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.300 
be gone from today the 23rd and I get
back<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.899> believe<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:50.409> Thursday<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.009> third

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
back I believe that's Thursday to third

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.010 
back I believe that's Thursday to third
but<00:01:51.610> that's<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.850> nine<00:01:52.030> o'clock<00:01:52.060> flight<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.929> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
but that's a nine o'clock flight so it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.809 
but that's a nine o'clock flight so it
might<00:01:53.200> as<00:01:53.229> well<00:01:53.470> just<00:01:53.649> be<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.890> fourth<00:01:54.189> friday

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
might as well just be the fourth friday

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.210 
might as well just be the fourth friday
so<00:01:55.030> i'll<00:01:55.240> be<00:01:55.360> gone<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.869> little<00:01:56.470> less<00:01:56.860> than<00:01:56.890> two

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
so i'll be gone a little less than two

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.449 
so i'll be gone a little less than two
weeks<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:58.810> might<00:01:59.049> be<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.349> delay<00:01:59.530> in<00:02:00.130> my

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459

the times and when I got my new pc i

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.610 
the times and when I got my new pc i
sort<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.120> making<00:02:37.359> my<00:02:37.420> videos<00:02:37.780> longer<00:02:38.140> we're<00:02:38.560> on

till the whole story of a game and then

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.210 
till the whole story of a game and then
i<00:02:40.780> also<00:02:40.840> bumped<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.620> rendering<00:02:42.100> quality

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
i also bumped up the rendering quality

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.819 
i also bumped up the rendering quality
what<00:02:43.030> i<00:02:43.060> actually<00:02:43.269> finished<00:02:43.630> my<00:02:43.900> videos<00:02:44.319> so

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
what i actually finished my videos so

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.210 
what i actually finished my videos so
the<00:02:45.310> videos<00:02:45.639> I<00:02:45.790> make<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.799> quality-wise<00:02:47.799> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
the videos I make now quality-wise the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
the videos I make now quality-wise the
lengthwise<00:02:48.549> are<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> lot<00:02:49.120> longer<00:02:49.299> than<00:02:49.600> they

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
lengthwise are a lot longer than they

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.740 
lengthwise are a lot longer than they
used<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.019> be<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:51.489> not<00:02:51.549> sure<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.209> laptop

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
used to be and I'm not sure if my laptop

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.449 
used to be and I'm not sure if my laptop
could<00:02:53.019> honestly<00:02:53.200> handle<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.310> these

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
could honestly handle one of these

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.970 
could honestly handle one of these
episodes<00:02:54.790> because<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.660> used<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.989> be<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.470> know

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
episodes because it used to be you know

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.229 
episodes because it used to be you know
the<00:02:57.010> computer<00:02:57.430> will<00:02:57.639> grow<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.819> really<00:02:58.030> hot

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
the computer will grow it really hot

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
the computer will grow it really hot
first<00:02:58.480> off<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.170> would<00:02:59.260> take<00:02:59.410> over<00:02:59.620> an<00:02:59.769> hour

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
first off and it would take over an hour

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.830 
first off and it would take over an hour
to<00:03:00.370> render<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.880> those<00:03:01.000> ten<00:03:01.239> minute<00:03:01.480> videos

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
to render one of those ten minute videos

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.690 
to render one of those ten minute videos
and<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.560> now<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:02.769> my<00:03:03.010> videos<00:03:03.340> kind<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.609> be

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and so now with my videos kind of be

I'm going to give it a shot I mean that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.880 
I'm going to give it a shot I mean that
computers<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.599> lot<00:03:25.690> slower<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.530> now<00:03:26.680> it's

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
computers a lot slower and now it's

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.220 
computers a lot slower and now it's
around<00:03:27.160> four<00:03:27.580> maybe<00:03:27.819> five<00:03:28.000> years<00:03:28.269> old<00:03:28.810> I'm

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230

around four maybe five years old I'm
gonna<00:03:29.410> see<00:03:29.620> if<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.830> can<00:03:29.920> handle<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.400> and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
gonna see if it can handle it and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.979 
gonna see if it can handle it and
hopefully<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.150> does<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.660> would<00:03:31.840> like

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
hopefully it does because I would like

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.930 
hopefully it does because I would like
to<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.290> couple<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.890> those<00:03:33.280> episodes<00:03:33.580> up
