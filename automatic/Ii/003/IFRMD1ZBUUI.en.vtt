00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
about with Steve rear so far I mean we

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.719 
about with Steve rear so far I mean we
can<00:04:18.180> go<00:04:18.209> through<00:04:18.570> staff<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:20.430> know<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:20.700> a

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
can go through staff and you know as a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.610 
can go through staff and you know as a
team<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:22.049> think<00:04:22.950> when<00:04:23.220> Rennie<00:04:23.520> love<00:04:24.620> before

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.680 
team I think when Rennie love before
Randy<00:04:25.950> laughs<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.760> know<00:04:26.849> I<00:04:26.880> had<00:04:27.030> good<00:04:27.360> stuff

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
Randy laughs I you know I had good stuff

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410 
Randy laughs I you know I had good stuff
essen<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.530> think<00:04:28.830> as<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.980> team<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.520> for<00:04:30.150> some

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
essen and I think as a team and for some

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.910 
essen and I think as a team and for some
reason<00:04:31.220> after<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.340> we<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.760> we<00:04:33.420> try<00:04:33.690> to

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
reason after that we just we try to

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.170 
reason after that we just we try to
change<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:35.070> little<00:04:35.190> bit<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.970> know<00:04:36.030> our

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
change a little bit of you know our

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.950 
change a little bit of you know our
system<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.170> just<00:04:37.380> didn't<00:04:37.620> work<00:04:37.800> for<00:04:37.860> us<00:04:38.960> as

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
system and it just didn't work for us as

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.140 
system and it just didn't work for us as
a<00:04:40.020> team<00:04:40.170> we<00:04:40.530> didn't<00:04:40.740> play<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.760> way<00:04:41.910> we<00:04:41.940> should

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
a team we didn't play the way we should

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.590 
a team we didn't play the way we should
open<00:04:43.490> there's<00:04:44.490> not<00:04:44.640> much<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.060> say<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.270> think<00:04:45.540> we

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
open there's not much to say I think we

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.240 
open there's not much to say I think we
just<00:04:45.630> need<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.500> know<00:04:46.590> turn<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.980> page<00:04:47.220> and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
just need to you know turn the page and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.070 
just need to you know turn the page and
then<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.910> think<00:04:48.210> most<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.630> guys<00:04:48.810> are

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
then I think most of the guys are

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.030 
then I think most of the guys are
excited<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.890> come<00:04:50.040> back<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.460> year<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.910> and
