here's<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.599> really<00:00:00.870> fun<00:00:01.050> move<00:00:01.260> that<00:00:01.500> allows<00:00:01.770> you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
here's a really fun move that allows you

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.329 
here's a really fun move that allows you
to<00:00:02.040> shoot<00:00:02.490> cards<00:00:02.850> off<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.179> deck<00:00:03.389> like<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.339> it's

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
to shoot cards off the deck like so it's

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.950 
to shoot cards off the deck like so it's
it's<00:00:05.940> kind<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> hard<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.330> give<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.690> full

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
it's kind of hard to give you a full

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.480 
it's kind of hard to give you a full
idea<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.319> what<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.500> looks<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:07.799> because<00:00:08.280> of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
idea of what this looks like because of

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.959 
idea of what this looks like because of
the<00:00:08.820> scope<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.269> my<00:00:09.389> camera<00:00:09.800> but<00:00:10.800> what<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.759> can

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the scope of my camera but what I can

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.310 
the scope of my camera but what I can
say<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.420> once<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.660> practice<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
say is that once you practice this you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.079 
say is that once you practice this you
can<00:00:13.469> really<00:00:13.679> shoot<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.219> quite<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> large

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
can really shoot it quite a large

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.029 
can really shoot it quite a large
distance<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.619> know<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> more<00:00:17.010> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
distance and you know the more you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.950 
distance and you know the more you
practice<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:18.359> control<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.810> have

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
practice it the more control you have

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
practice it the more control you have
over<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.039> shooting<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> card<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
over the shooting of the card and the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
over the shooting of the card and the
more<00:00:21.420> control<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.869> over<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
more control you have over the the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.700 
more control you have over the the
distance<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.570> direction<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
distance and the direction that it

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.349 
distance and the direction that it
shoots<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> everything<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
shoots and everything so it's just a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.160 
shoots and everything so it's just a
really<00:00:27.660> fun<00:00:27.869> move<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.650> learn<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
here's the method for how to do this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
here's the method for how to do this
you're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.550> holding<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you're going to start by holding the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.340 
you're going to start by holding the
deck<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.539> left<00:00:45.719> hand<00:00:45.809> mechanic's<00:00:46.260> grip

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
deck and your left hand mechanic's grip

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
deck and your left hand mechanic's grip
and<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.219> you're<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> transition<00:00:48.000> over

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and then you're going to transition over

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
and then you're going to transition over
to<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> grip<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to a grip like this so you're just

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.500 
to a grip like this so you're just
taking<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.730> first<00:00:50.940> finger<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> you're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
taking that first finger and you're

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.319 
taking that first finger and you're
moving<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> right<00:00:52.079> edge<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> deck

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
moving it to the right edge of the deck

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.790 
moving it to the right edge of the deck
the<00:00:54.329> next<00:00:54.600> step<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the next step is we're going to take the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
the next step is we're going to take the
pad<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.730> middle<00:00:56.969> finger<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.690> going

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
pad of your middle finger you're going

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.430 
pad of your middle finger you're going
to<00:00:57.899> contact<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> topmost<00:00:58.829> card<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to contact the topmost card and I you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
to contact the topmost card and I you
notice<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> removed<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.940> ring

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
deck so I'm now holding like this and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.870 
deck so I'm now holding like this and
then<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.130> middle<00:01:08.310> finger<00:01:08.670> I'm

it<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:13.130> okay<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.820> I'm<00:01:15.170> pulling<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it like this okay so I'm pulling it to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429 
it like this okay so I'm pulling it to
the<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.650> essentially<00:01:18.110> once<00:01:19.110> I've<00:01:19.259> done

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the right essentially once I've done

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.120 
the right essentially once I've done
that<00:01:19.500> next<00:01:20.460> step<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> I'm<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.070> remove<00:01:23.070> my

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that next step is I'm going to remove my

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
that next step is I'm going to remove my
middle<00:01:23.549> finger<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> maintain<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
middle finger I'm going to maintain the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.539 
middle finger I'm going to maintain the
position<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.920> card<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.280> my<00:01:26.369> first

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
position of this card with my first

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
position of this card with my first
finger<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.020> duct<00:01:28.350> my<00:01:28.560> middle<00:01:28.829> finger

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
finger and then I duct my middle finger

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
finger and then I duct my middle finger
underneath<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> card<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.299> start<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
underneath the card and they start to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.740 
underneath the card and they start to
push<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.360> my<00:01:33.600> first

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
push up on it at the same time my first

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
push up on it at the same time my first
finger<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.079> pushing<00:01:34.560> pressure<00:01:34.799> downwards<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
finger is pushing pressure downwards so

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
finger is pushing pressure downwards so
this<00:01:36.450> creates<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> tension<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> card

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
this creates the tension in the card

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
this creates the tension in the card
notice<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> flexing<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> little

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
notice how it's kind of flexing a little

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.789 
notice how it's kind of flexing a little
bit<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.820> when<00:01:42.689> you're<00:01:42.840> ready<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.320> shoot<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
bit and when you're ready to shoot the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.090 
bit and when you're ready to shoot the
card<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> continue<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> pull<00:01:46.740> up

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
card what I do is I continue to pull up

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.719 
card what I do is I continue to pull up
or<00:01:47.549> push<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.540> middle<00:01:48.840> finger<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.729> that's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
or push up my middle finger and that's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490 
or push up my middle finger and that's
going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> cause<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> card<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> flip<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
going to cause the card to flip out and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.690 
going to cause the card to flip out and
spin<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.430> spinning

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
spin it's going to be spinning

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
spin it's going to be spinning
counterclockwise<00:01:54.770> alright<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.890> difficult

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
counterclockwise alright it's difficult

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.389 
counterclockwise alright it's difficult
to<00:01:56.759> demonstrate<00:01:56.850> slowly<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> speed<00:01:58.399> bad

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
to demonstrate slowly but a speed bad

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.260 
to demonstrate slowly but a speed bad
example<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:01.079> looks<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:02.369> okay<00:02:03.060> let<00:02:03.180> me

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
example it looks like that okay let me

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910 
example it looks like that okay let me
play<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.780> slow<00:02:03.899> motion<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
play one in slow motion so you can get a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.730 
play one in slow motion so you can get a
better<00:02:05.130> idea<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.119> motion

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.110 

okay<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.330> once<00:02:15.780> again<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:17.190> drag<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.850> car<00:02:18.030> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
okay so once again you drag the car to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.810 
okay so once again you drag the car to
the<00:02:18.270> right<00:02:19.220> duck<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.400> middle<00:02:20.580> finger

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the right duck your middle finger

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.580 
the right duck your middle finger
underneath<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> part

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
underneath and then this is the part

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.840 
underneath and then this is the part
this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> nakki<00:02:23.250> part<00:02:23.550> where<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:23.760> just

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
this is the nakki part where you're just

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.400 
this is the nakki part where you're just
going<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> need<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.330> experiment<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.230> how<00:02:25.350> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to need to experiment with how you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.620 
going to need to experiment with how you
apply<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.890> pressure<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:27.000> let<00:02:27.240> me<00:02:27.330> give<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
apply that pressure but let me give you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.970 
apply that pressure but let me give you
this<00:02:27.810> angle<00:02:28.140> right<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:29.660> just

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
this angle right here I'm I'm just

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.000 
this angle right here I'm I'm just
extending<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.220> middle<00:02:32.490> finger<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.920> know

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
extending my middle finger and you know

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.110 
extending my middle finger and you know
once<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> get<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.550> hang<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.880> you're<00:02:36.030> going

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
once you get the hang of it you're going

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
once you get the hang of it you're going
to<00:02:36.210> be<00:02:36.330> able<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> aim<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.230> card<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to be able to aim the card and in the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
to be able to aim the card and in the
direction<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> want<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> could<00:02:39.900> shoot

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
direction that you want so I could shoot

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.380 
direction that you want so I could shoot
it<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> right<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:42.360> I

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it to the right kind of like this or I

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.930 
it to the right kind of like this or I
can<00:02:42.630> shoot<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> out<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.200> front<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.500> me<00:02:43.700> by<00:02:44.700> kind

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
can shoot it out in front of me by kind

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.280 
can shoot it out in front of me by kind
of<00:02:45.000> pointing<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.660> middle<00:02:45.870> finger<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
of pointing my middle finger in that

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.870 
of pointing my middle finger in that
direction<00:02:46.680> that's<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.610> something<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
direction that's just something that

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.800 
direction that's just something that
you're<00:02:48.060> gonna<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.330> play<00:02:48.480> around<00:02:48.600> with

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
you're gonna have to play around with

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.380 
you're gonna have to play around with
and<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.580> more<00:02:50.790> tension<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.300> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
and then the more tension that you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.000 
and then the more tension that you
create<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.870> card<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.350> then<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> quicker

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
create in that card and then the quicker

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.280 
create in that card and then the quicker
that<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> push<00:02:53.460> up<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.760> your<00:02:53.910> middle<00:02:53.970> finger

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
that you push up with your middle finger

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.930 
that you push up with your middle finger
the<00:02:55.290> further<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.220> card<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.550> going<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> travel

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the further the card is going to travel

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.580 
the further the card is going to travel
the<00:02:57.120> faster<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> card<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.350> spin

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the faster the card is going to spin

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
the faster the card is going to spin
alright<00:02:59.370> that's<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> basic<00:03:00.120> concept<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
alright that's the basic concept for you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.420 
alright that's the basic concept for you
it's<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.470> really<00:03:01.710> cool<00:03:01.950> card<00:03:02.190> shooting

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's just a really cool card shooting

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.600
