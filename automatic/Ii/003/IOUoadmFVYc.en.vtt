00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:09.520
 It is a lie that humans use only 10% of the brain 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:14.349
 Psychiatrist Serizawa Shion no Kaba Channel human beings 5% of the brain 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:18.670
 Or maybe I heard somewhere that 10% is only using a part 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:24.789
 I'd think that a person is often the Tteyuu also paper to be this basis it was looking for me once 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.070
 It is much less out do is I'd not find by ne recent interesting research there is a 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.349
 ring 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:34.670
 It is called a pet how many prefectures use it. It is a real brain metabolism 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.989
 Do you have diagnostic imaging to measure with time ? There is research that we examined using it 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:45.060
 It Is the Tteyuu site roughly brain It is Then there is activity 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:48.150
 It's about 10% It's about 10% if you capture this moment now, but now 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.920
 Another part is working when you look at the door different time zone 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.460
 Different parts alternate with each other like this one part will work 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 is not it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:04.320
 Only about 10% of the end of it is the whole will see in a moment that I hope are working brain 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.080
 It is not used, but the whole after all is used when it looks very in 10 minutes 1 hour 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.180
 School that says 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:16.390
 It is the usage of the brain that people are active, so we can say in a recent paper 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.090
 So what's interesting is that the brain is only used 10% is so-called horse 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.549
 is not it 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:28.549
 There is one more interesting data, and the brain is 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.630
 20% 30% If we can use it, we can demonstrate great ability 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.950
 It though I was each other do not come even movies such Rikubesson supervision of Lucy 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.020
 Can not do is the real has 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.979
 Why and say when I in the case of the normal 10% and I'm Chan Chat key type pet 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:50.070
 It's been working after about two percent of the neurons you want to add by 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 The brain's oxygen is consumed, but the brain is only 2% of the body weight 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 But 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 It accounts for 20% of the total reference consumption 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 we 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:06.070
 It's consumes 20 percent because I I have smoked this much oxygen are turning blood 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.479
 It consumes 20% of oxygen at 2% of activity of one body neuron. 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.960
 If activity increased from 2% to 3% 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.960
 It is said that it becomes lack of oxygen and loses consciousness 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.440
 For example , double this 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.280
 If you increase it to 40%, you will need 40% of the oxygen transferred, so you can not afford it at all 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
 is not it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.750
 The brain is a huge amount of sound oxygen and post glucose 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.390
 It's glucose, so it's going to waste this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 Delicate it is to require an enormous amount of energy Kedomo is Taraii wore a bad head of fuel consumption 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.930
 It is not an organ 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.300
 So if you do this twice you have to double our heart, maybe blood flow 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.630
 The 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.740
 As I said earlier, the brains alternate 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.670
 While acting in different parts of the other part alternate 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:59.250
 While switching, that is how to reduce oxygen consumption 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:02.290
 Because You used the taste Sanno that are using here it in the most senior active is the consumption of glucose 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 We are now active twice our no 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:12.510
 It is already the world of movies that you can fully demonstrate your ability No. 2 The sound you are now yourself 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.510
 I think it would be better to think about using the skills possessed by
