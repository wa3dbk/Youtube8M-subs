charging port now on top of that you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.730 
charging port now on top of that you
probably<00:01:54.479> notice<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.560> bit

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
probably notice is actually a little bit

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590 
probably notice is actually a little bit
of<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> lip<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> gap<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.119> that's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
of a lip or a gap here and that's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
of a lip or a gap here and that's
because<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> device<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.380> sliding<00:01:58.920> full

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280

very similar to that of the HTC tilt

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.310 
very similar to that of the HTC tilt
there<00:02:04.380> almost<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.909> rubberized<00:02:05.909> feel<00:02:06.750> they're

very flat and they provide a great
amount<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.629> feedback<00:02:09.950> immediately<00:02:10.950> hear<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
amount of feedback immediately hear the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.339 
amount of feedback immediately hear the
actual<00:02:11.640> clicks<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:13.020> they<00:02:13.110> provide<00:02:13.260> a

the device itself you will have to
remove<00:03:09.750> your<00:03:09.840> battery<00:03:10.049> now<00:03:10.620> beating<00:03:10.950> at<00:03:11.040> the

heart<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.519> device<00:03:11.849> is<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.590> 720<00:03:13.590> megahertz

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
heart of this device is a 720 megahertz

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.559 
heart of this device is a 720 megahertz
processor<00:03:14.400> now<00:03:14.849> we<00:03:14.909> did<00:03:15.090> say<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
processor now we did say this is a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.259 
processor now we did say this is a
mid-range<00:03:16.260> android<00:03:16.739> device<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.370> proofs

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
mid-range android device and that proofs

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.819 
mid-range android device and that proofs
so<00:03:18.480> right<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:18.900> with<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.169> sort<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.500> spec

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
so right there with that sort of spec

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.250 
so right there with that sort of spec
however<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.609> does<00:03:20.819> have<00:03:21.030> 512<00:03:21.750> megabytes<00:03:22.169> of

however it does have 512 megabytes of
