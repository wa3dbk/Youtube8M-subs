00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
the ice is very unsafe right from this

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.490 
the ice is very unsafe right from this
point<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.900> here<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.610> anyway<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:20.080> this<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.350> what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
point on here but anyway so this is what

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.950 
point on here but anyway so this is what
we<00:01:20.590> get<00:01:20.800> first<00:01:21.610> thing<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.910> morning<00:01:22.300> now

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
we get first thing in the morning now

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.830 
we get first thing in the morning now
what<00:01:23.170> we're<00:01:23.320> doing<00:01:23.830> estimation<00:01:24.460> as<00:01:25.240> far<00:01:25.600> as

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
what we're doing estimation as far as

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.540 
what we're doing estimation as far as
how<00:01:26.590> much<00:01:26.770> ice<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.130> think<00:01:27.370> we<00:01:27.460> got<00:01:27.490> out<00:01:27.820> there

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
how much ice we think we got out there

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.930 
how much ice we think we got out there
based<00:01:30.550> on<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.690> calculations<00:01:32.470> from<00:01:33.460> when<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
based on the calculations from when the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
based on the calculations from when the
ice<00:01:34.090> turned<00:01:34.420> over<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:35.740> looking<00:01:36.040> at<00:01:36.160> about

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
ice turned over we're looking at about

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.870 
ice turned over we're looking at about
three<00:01:37.960> quarters<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.290> an<00:01:38.500> inch<00:01:38.650> now<00:01:38.950> guys<00:01:39.250> okay

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
three quarters of an inch now guys okay

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.050 
three quarters of an inch now guys okay
so<00:01:40.720> if<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:41.710> do<00:01:41.830> our<00:01:41.860> calculations<00:01:42.130> every<00:01:42.880> day

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
so if we do our calculations every day

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.940 
so if we do our calculations every day
and<00:01:43.240> at<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.360> quarter<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.780> an<00:01:43.870> inch<00:01:44.020> might<00:01:44.770> be

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
and at a quarter of an inch might be

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.340 
and at a quarter of an inch might be
more<00:01:45.180> might<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.330> less<00:01:46.510> will<00:01:46.780> know<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> exact

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
more might be less will know the exact

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.030 
more might be less will know the exact
day<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.560> get<00:01:47.800> on<00:01:47.950> here<00:01:49.410> but<00:01:50.410> anyway<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:50.890> is

take<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.400> arms<00:03:51.820> right<00:03:52.180> off<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.600> gate<00:03:52.780> right

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
take the arms right off the gate right

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.960 
take the arms right off the gate right
to<00:03:53.590> make<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.950> little<00:03:54.130> easier<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.640> navigate

for us I think he's an agreement with
that<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.080> looks<00:03:59.080> like<00:03:59.290> it's<00:03:59.470> going<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.739> happen

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890
