00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
thing that will stand out and I think

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.210 
thing that will stand out and I think
that's<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.180> beauty<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.540> every<00:02:51.020> frame<00:02:51.350> you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that's the beauty of every frame you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
that's the beauty of every frame you
know<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.820> everything<00:02:53.240> looks<00:02:53.480> beautiful<00:02:53.990> but

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
know that everything looks beautiful but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.950 
know that everything looks beautiful but
you<00:02:54.230> can't<00:02:54.410> pinpoint<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:55.130> one<00:02:55.400> thing<00:02:55.960> he

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
you can't pinpoint that one thing he

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.010 
you can't pinpoint that one thing he
knows<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.650> know<00:02:57.800> he<00:02:58.100> knows<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.940> think<00:02:59.690> he's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
