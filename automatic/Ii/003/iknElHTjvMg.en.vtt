00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
gems and that's something I'd recommend

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
gems and that's something I'd recommend
would<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.109> 500<00:00:25.619> gems<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
would be 500 gems you get in the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
would be 500 gems you get in the
beginning<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> game<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.750> second

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
beginning of the game get your second

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
beginning of the game get your second
builders<00:00:28.650> Hut<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> builders<00:00:29.670> huts<00:00:29.849> are

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
builders Hut and builders huts are

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
builders Hut and builders huts are
definitely<00:00:30.449> very<00:00:30.480> important<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> game

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
definitely very important for the game

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
definitely very important for the game
you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.949> upgrade<00:00:32.070> different<00:00:32.880> things<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.239> once

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you can upgrade different things at once

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.880 
you can upgrade different things at once
so<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.260> builders<00:00:34.590> sites<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so if you have two builders sites you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.889 
so if you have two builders sites you
can<00:00:34.920> upgrade<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> different<00:00:36.270> things<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.600> once

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
can upgrade to different things at once

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.590 
can upgrade to different things at once
and<00:00:37.110> once<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> five<00:00:38.640> builders<00:00:39.149> Hut's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and once you get the five builders Hut's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
and once you get the five builders Hut's
you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> you're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can do so much with it and you're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.860 
you can do so much with it and you're
often<00:00:42.450> left<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.520> many<00:00:44.520> builders<00:00:45.000> available

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
often left with many builders available

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
often left with many builders available
so<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> recommend<00:00:46.620> buying<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:47.070> least<00:00:47.129> three

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so I recommend buying at least three

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
so I recommend buying at least three
builder<00:00:48.390> sites<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> maybe<00:00:49.110> even<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> four<00:00:49.829> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
builder sites and maybe even the four so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880 
builder sites and maybe even the four so
that<00:00:50.129> takes<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.050> gemin<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that takes a little bit of gemin and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.729 
that takes a little bit of gemin and
just<00:00:53.640> removing<00:00:54.480> obstacles<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
just removing obstacles if you want to

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279 
just removing obstacles if you want to
spend<00:00:56.010> money<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.780> not

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
spend money you can and that's not

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.170 
spend money you can and that's not
frowned<00:00:58.649> upon<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.640> could<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.030> if

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
frowned upon at all you could do that if

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.380 
frowned upon at all you could do that if
you<00:01:00.300> want<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.500> next<00:01:02.010> reason<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> next<00:01:03.180> way

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you want the next reason or the next way

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
you want the next reason or the next way
to<00:01:03.449> spend<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.049> gems<00:01:04.379> most<00:01:04.680> efficiently<00:01:05.159> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to spend your gems most efficiently in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.750 
to spend your gems most efficiently in
clash<00:01:05.519> clans<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.990> only<00:01:07.470> use<00:01:08.340> them<00:01:08.580> for

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
clash clans is to only use them for

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
clash clans is to only use them for
boosting<00:01:09.420> troops<00:01:09.750> never<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.619> train<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
boosting troops never actually train the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490 
boosting troops never actually train the
troops<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.850> gem<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:13.140> always

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
troops and just gem them up it's always

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
troops and just gem them up it's always
more<00:01:13.770> efficient<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> boost<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.299> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
more efficient to boost them you can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.010 
more efficient to boost them you can
wait<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.830> few<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.700> minutes<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
wait just a few more minutes and get the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
wait just a few more minutes and get the
troops<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.860> without<00:01:20.100> actually<00:01:20.729> jamming

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
troops you want without actually jamming

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
troops you want without actually jamming
them<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:21.990> when<00:01:22.650> I'm

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
them so this is something I do when I'm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429 
them so this is something I do when I'm
going<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> long<00:01:24.360> session<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.229> pushing

League I like to train up barche and
instead<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> jamming<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
instead of jamming them up I can just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.060 
instead of jamming them up I can just
wait<00:01:32.250> around<00:01:32.520> five<00:01:32.939> minutes<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.650> army

they're all full so that's something I
really<00:01:39.000> enjoy<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.079> boosting<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
really enjoy about boosting and it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.359 
really enjoy about boosting and it's
just<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> waste<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.090> gems<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.710> jam<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
just a waste of gems just to jam up the

and<00:01:45.340> if<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.670> want<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.000> run<00:01:46.270> out<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.480> gems<00:01:46.750> very

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
and if you want to run out of gems very

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.220 
and if you want to run out of gems very
quickly<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.440> suggest<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.220> not<00:01:48.550> do<00:01:48.880> that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
quickly I suggest you not do that

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.840 
quickly I suggest you not do that
another<00:01:50.230> way<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.470> use<00:01:51.190> your<00:01:51.430> gems<00:01:51.670> more

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
another way to use your gems more

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.790 
another way to use your gems more
efficiently<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.930> go<00:01:53.170> ahead<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.560> boost

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
efficiently is to go ahead and boost

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.770 
efficiently is to go ahead and boost
your<00:01:53.950> elixir<00:01:54.460> collector<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.630> mine

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
your elixir collector and go of mine

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.960 
your elixir collector and go of mine
when<00:01:56.320> they're<00:01:56.500> at<00:01:56.620> one<00:01:57.010> gem<00:01:57.400> each<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.940> can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
when they're at one gem each you can

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.940 
when they're at one gem each you can
also<00:01:58.240> do<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.570> when<00:01:58.930> it's<00:01:59.050> not<00:01:59.320> one<00:01:59.590> gem<00:01:59.800> each

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
also do that when it's not one gem each

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.670 
also do that when it's not one gem each
but<00:02:00.370> if<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.610> guys<00:02:01.030> know<00:02:01.390> when<00:02:01.810> supercell<00:02:02.260> has

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
but if you guys know when supercell has

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.050 
but if you guys know when supercell has
a<00:02:02.710> special<00:02:03.250> event<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:03.790> they<00:02:03.850> want<00:02:04.030> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
a special event and they want to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.760 
a special event and they want to
celebrate<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.570> they<00:02:04.780> usually<00:02:04.990> go<00:02:05.350> ahead<00:02:05.590> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
celebrate it they usually go ahead and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.490 
celebrate it they usually go ahead and
just<00:02:06.460> gem<00:02:06.760> up<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.180> elixir<00:02:07.600> collectors<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.350> go

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
just gem up the elixir collectors and go

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.310 
just gem up the elixir collectors and go
mines<00:02:08.740> for<00:02:09.100> one<00:02:09.610> gem<00:02:10.270> each<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.840> that's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
mines for one gem each and that's

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.620 
mines for one gem each and that's
something<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.770> really<00:02:12.340> like<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.760> some<00:02:13.390> people

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
something I really like and some people

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.480 
something I really like and some people
just<00:02:13.660> go<00:02:13.900> ahead<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.860> jump<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:15.220> their

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
just go ahead and just jump up their

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.640 
just go ahead and just jump up their
gold<00:02:15.700> capacity<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.600> elixir<00:02:16.990> capacity

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
gold capacity and your elixir capacity

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.140 
gold capacity and your elixir capacity
all<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> way<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.100> eight<00:02:18.459> million<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.060> that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
all the way so eight million and that

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.449 
all the way so eight million and that
cost<00:02:19.390> around<00:02:19.540> two<00:02:19.900> thousand<00:02:20.470> four<00:02:21.280> hundred

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
cost around two thousand four hundred

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.060 
cost around two thousand four hundred
gems<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.330> each<00:02:22.630> which<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.260> kind<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.590> sad<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
gems for each which is kind of sad and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.010 
gems for each which is kind of sad and
I'd<00:02:24.580> really<00:02:24.880> recommend<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.570> jamming<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
I'd really recommend just jamming up the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.590 
I'd really recommend just jamming up the
elixir<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.800> gold<00:02:27.520> collectors<00:02:28.120> because

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
elixir and gold collectors because

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.810 
elixir and gold collectors because
that's<00:02:29.200> way<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.680> efficient<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.370> if<00:02:30.700> you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
that's way more efficient and if you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.120 
that's way more efficient and if you
guys<00:02:30.940> want<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.600> know<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.530> they<00:02:32.709> actually

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
guys want to know a way they actually

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.980 
guys want to know a way they actually
get<00:02:33.280> three<00:02:33.670> gems<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.420> guys<00:02:34.540> are<00:02:34.690> kind

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
get three gems and if you guys are kind

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.630 
get three gems and if you guys are kind
of<00:02:35.050> noobs<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:35.980> ahead<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.220> check<00:02:36.520> out

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
of noobs you can go ahead and check out

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.770 
of noobs you can go ahead and check out
the<00:02:36.790> first<00:02:37.030> link<00:02:37.360> down<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> description

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the first link down in the description

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.740 
the first link down in the description
yeah<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.950> says<00:02:39.160> how<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.400> get<00:02:39.640> free<00:02:39.940> gems<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.540> go

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
yeah it says how to get free gems and go

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.449 
yeah it says how to get free gems and go
ahead<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.080> click<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.470> very<00:02:41.770> very<00:02:42.160> easy

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
ahead and click it it's very very easy

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.340 
ahead and click it it's very very easy
and<00:02:42.760> that's<00:02:43.360> something<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.750> definitely

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
and that's something I definitely

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.960 
and that's something I definitely
recommend<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.010> probably<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> easiest<00:02:45.700> way

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
recommend it's probably the easiest way

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.660 
recommend it's probably the easiest way
to<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:47.070> another<00:02:48.070> thing<00:02:48.340> I'd<00:02:48.459> recommend

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
to do it another thing I'd recommend

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.060 
to do it another thing I'd recommend
doing<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.540> saving<00:02:49.959> up<00:02:50.050> all<00:02:50.230> those<00:02:50.470> gems<00:02:50.709> until

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
doing is saving up all those gems until

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.800 
doing is saving up all those gems until
it's<00:02:51.220> time<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.430> upgrade<00:02:51.910> your<00:02:52.060> Town<00:02:52.300> Hall<00:02:52.570> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
it's time to upgrade your Town Hall and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.600 
it's time to upgrade your Town Hall and
some<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.560> guys<00:02:53.680> spend<00:02:54.010> all<00:02:54.160> your<00:02:54.280> gems<00:02:54.489> on

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
some of you guys spend all your gems on

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
some of you guys spend all your gems on
those<00:02:54.730> defenses<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:55.390> one<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> only<00:02:56.230> times

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
those defenses but one of the only times

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.160 
those defenses but one of the only times
to<00:02:56.980> spend<00:02:57.310> your<00:02:57.700> gems<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.269> time<00:02:58.600> is<00:02:58.930> actually

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
to spend your gems on time is actually

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.590 
to spend your gems on time is actually
speeding<00:02:59.890> up<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.459> town<00:03:00.790> hall<00:03:01.030> upgrade<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
speeding up the town hall upgrade and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.330 
speeding up the town hall upgrade and
usually<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:01.989> takes<00:03:02.170> about<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.470> week<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.920> it's

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
usually this takes about a week and it's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.979 
usually this takes about a week and it's
definitely<00:03:03.670> worth<00:03:03.970> instead<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.600> spending<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
definitely worth instead of spending it

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.040 
definitely worth instead of spending it
on<00:03:05.140> defenses<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.790> last<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.269> final<00:03:07.600> thing<00:03:07.630> is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
on defenses the last and final thing is

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.630 
on defenses the last and final thing is
that<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.380> you're<00:03:08.530> pushing<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.250> really

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
that if you're pushing and you really

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.370 
that if you're pushing and you really
need<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.940> raid<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.630> now<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.140> right<00:03:11.350> here

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
need to raid right now and right here

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.160 
need to raid right now and right here
you<00:03:12.160> might<00:03:12.489> need<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.970> jam<00:03:13.300> up<00:03:13.330> your<00:03:13.690> request

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
you might need to jam up your request

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.710 
you might need to jam up your request
time<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:14.769> your<00:03:14.920> clan<00:03:15.160> castle<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.390> might

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
time for your clan castle and that might

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.330 
time for your clan castle and that might
be<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> necessity<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.470> you're<00:03:17.620> up<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:17.799> champs<00:03:18.250> I
