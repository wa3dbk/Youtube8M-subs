project<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:18.180> i<00:00:18.210> wasn't<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> give<00:00:18.840> away

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
project now i wasn't going to give away

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.599 
project now i wasn't going to give away
too<00:00:19.020> many<00:00:19.320> details<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.039> other<00:00:20.189> project

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
too many details about the other project

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
too many details about the other project
because<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.420> still<00:00:21.600> quite<00:00:21.779> early<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because it's still quite early on in the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 
because it's still quite early on in the
design<00:00:22.740> process<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.970> wasn't<00:00:24.180> quite<00:00:24.240> sure

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
design process and I wasn't quite sure

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.060 
design process and I wasn't quite sure
exactly<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> wanted<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> include<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
exactly what I wanted to include in and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.120 
exactly what I wanted to include in and
leave<00:00:26.550> out<00:00:27.140> however<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.380> did<00:00:28.590> notice<00:00:28.920> was

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
leave out however what did notice was

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.009 
leave out however what did notice was
that<00:00:29.160> over<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.820> last<00:00:29.910> few<00:00:30.119> days<00:00:30.269> I've<00:00:30.810> got

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that over the last few days I've got

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.510 
that over the last few days I've got
quite<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> bit<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> feedback<00:00:31.560> via<00:00:32.040> YouTube

comments blog posts and quite FEMA's and
regarding<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> ice<00:00:36.600> application<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> people

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
regarding the ice application and people

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.280 
regarding the ice application and people
suggesting<00:00:38.160> some<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.360> ideas<00:00:39.540> which

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
suggesting some really good ideas which

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
suggesting some really good ideas which
I<00:00:40.469> hope<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> implement<00:00:41.340> over<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> next<00:00:41.790> couple

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I hope to implement over the next couple

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
I hope to implement over the next couple
months<00:00:42.270> before<00:00:43.050> launch<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> why<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> whole

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
months before launch so why the whole

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
months before launch so why the whole
would<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.629> idea<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
would be a good idea was if I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
would be a good idea was if I
demonstrate<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.160> early<00:00:47.399> prototype<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:48.090> my

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
demonstrate an early prototype of my

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.479 
demonstrate an early prototype of my
other<00:00:48.390> project<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.739> feedback<00:00:49.890> early<00:00:50.399> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
other project and get feedback early on

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
other project and get feedback early on
in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> development<00:00:51.390> process<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:52.230> order<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
in the development process in order to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
in the development process in order to
make<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> easier<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> incorporate<00:00:53.640> any<00:00:53.730> new

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
make it easier to incorporate any new

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
make it easier to incorporate any new
ideas<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> show<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
ideas so what I'm going to show you in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
ideas so what I'm going to show you in
this<00:00:56.129> video<00:00:56.280> today<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.629> demonstration<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this video today is a demonstration of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
this video today is a demonstration of
literally<00:00:59.219> an<00:00:59.520> hour's<00:00:59.910> work<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
literally an hour's work it's a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
literally an hour's work it's a
bare-bones<00:01:01.260> prototype<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.520> demonstrate<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bare-bones prototype to demonstrate the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.690 
bare-bones prototype to demonstrate the
concept<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.820> my<00:01:05.820> new<00:01:06.000> application<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:07.490> as<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
concept of my new application now as you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.460 
concept of my new application now as you
can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.060> called<00:01:09.210> panic<00:01:09.390> alert<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.110> was

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
can see it's called panic alert it was

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
can see it's called panic alert it was
unlike<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.490> unlike<00:01:11.760> ice<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.119> designed<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> be

three prominent buttons on the main

obviously when people are panicking

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
obviously when people are panicking
their<00:01:31.860> Russia<00:01:32.040> IT<00:01:32.400> decreases<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.210> does<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
their Russia IT decreases so does it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.700 
their Russia IT decreases so does it
make<00:01:33.540> sense<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> small<00:01:34.200> buttons<00:01:34.590> or

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
make sense to have small buttons or

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.859 
make sense to have small buttons or
