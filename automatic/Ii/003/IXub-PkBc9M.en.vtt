00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
might be different will still cover that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
might be different will still cover that
in<00:00:22.439> general<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.699> we'll<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.029> ahead<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> get

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
in general so we'll go ahead and get

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
in general so we'll go ahead and get
started<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.960> our<00:00:25.170> grow<00:00:25.350> box<00:00:25.590> right

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
started here with our grow box right

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.970 
started here with our grow box right
here<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> corn<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.680> sweet

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
here now we have the corn and the sweet

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.890 
here now we have the corn and the sweet
peas<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.519> everything<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.240> sprouted<00:00:30.779> up

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
peas so everything has sprouted up

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
peas so everything has sprouted up
looking<00:00:31.650> really<00:00:31.920> good<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.640> might<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.820> run

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
looking really good you might be run

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.819 
looking really good you might be run
into<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> few<00:00:33.600> things<00:00:33.870> caterpillars<00:00:34.590> really

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
into a few things caterpillars really

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.830 
into a few things caterpillars really
like<00:00:34.950> corn<00:00:35.280> especially<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
like corn especially this time of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840 
like corn especially this time of the
year<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.829> mostly<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> best

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
year so you're just mostly the best

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
year so you're just mostly the best
thing<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> hand<00:00:39.899> pick<00:00:40.140> those

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
thing to do with that is hand pick those

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.250 
thing to do with that is hand pick those
guys<00:00:40.350> off<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> also<00:00:42.510> might<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.020> little

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
guys off you also might have a little

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.110 
guys off you also might have a little
issue<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.680> leaf<00:00:44.040> miners<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> like

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
issue with leaf miners which is like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
issue with leaf miners which is like
what<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.350> they're<00:00:46.890> not

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
what we have right here they're not

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
what we have right here they're not
gonna<00:00:47.219> hurt<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> plant<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> plant<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.480> going

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
gonna hurt the plant the plant is going

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.029 
gonna hurt the plant the plant is going
to<00:00:48.660> keep<00:00:48.870> growing<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.800> worry<00:00:49.980> about

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to keep growing don't really worry about

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
to keep growing don't really worry about
that<00:00:50.219> too<00:00:50.640> much

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that too much

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
that too much
you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.809> pick<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> leaf<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> looks

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you can pick off the leaf if it looks

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
you can pick off the leaf if it looks
too<00:00:53.250> damaged<00:00:53.840> another<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.170> you're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

can use both the powders from your

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
can use both the powders from your
kitchen<00:01:03.329> cabinet<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.110> growing

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
kitchen cabinet if you're not growing

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.280 
kitchen cabinet if you're not growing
them<00:01:04.530> yourselves<00:01:05.010> mix<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.640> water<00:01:05.670> as

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
them yourselves mix them with water as

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
them yourselves mix them with water as
thick<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.680> possibly<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
thick as you possibly can put it in a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
thick as you possibly can put it in a
spray<00:01:09.330> bottle<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.900> spray<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
spray bottle and spray it on there it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
spray bottle and spray it on there it
doesn't<00:01:11.189> hurt<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> caterpillars<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
doesn't hurt the caterpillars but it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
doesn't hurt the caterpillars but it
burns<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
burns them they don't really like it the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
burns them they don't really like it the
flavor<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> terrible<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> they'll<00:01:15.150> move<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
flavor is terrible and they'll move on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
flavor is terrible and they'll move on
to<00:01:15.780> something<00:01:15.960> more<00:01:16.110> interesting<00:01:16.340> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to something more interesting it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
to something more interesting it's
important<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> notice<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> especially<00:01:18.750> with

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
important to notice of especially with

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
important to notice of especially with
these<00:01:19.020> leaf<00:01:19.229> miners<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
these leaf miners here first of all that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
these leaf miners here first of all that
any<00:01:20.729> green<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> leaves<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
any green on the leaves is going to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
any green on the leaves is going to
photosynthesize<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.759> plant<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
photosynthesize so if your plant is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
photosynthesize so if your plant is
covered<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.990> might<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.259> better

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
covered with this it might be better

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
covered with this it might be better
