 hello my name is low on the ground what makes success that therapist 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 and dear cause I'm going to talk to you about everything called depression 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.739
 seasonal 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.119
 I also speak of blues blues winter it's definition a 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.189
 little less scientific 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.590
 it is a problem as common as unknown 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.020
 what is the winter blues so roughly from September to the month 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.439
 from October until it's grilled or March 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.720
 you feel every year that your morale drops 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.599
 that you feel 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.109
 alister izik 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.440
 tired with fewer employees more stressed more anxious 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.860
 do you suffer from so-called seasonal depression 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.930
 to make the lights simple 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.679
 a very important impact on our morale 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.159
 but it does not concern everyone, it's just about us not giving you a part 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.380
 Population 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.740
 but these fears but it's still something very interesting 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.450
 especially as if we take the statistics the northern countries making 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.490
 that are susceptible to six glasses with much less brightness 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.900
 like alaska or the Scandinavian countries not 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.410
 for a suicide rate 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.770
 most important 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.680
 than the countries further south 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.100
 to fight against seasonal depression iliad a technique 13 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.570
 very very simple 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.570
 what is called light therapy 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.250
 you will also find it under other 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.340
 names speak of phototherapy or luxury to therapies that's exactly the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.960
 same thing 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.440
 the principle is always the same 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 since we will just expose ourselves to the light that reproduced the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.540
 frequency and intensity of sunlight is not obliged to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.210
 look directly not do it between half an hour to one hour each morning 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.860
 and this is a technique is very interesting since 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 the device does not cost you about 120 euros 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.700
 that it does not take a lot of time and for all the people who 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.329
 suffer from a transferee depression this will bring very quickly I 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.560
 am a member of a week or two weeks 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 a comfort 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.000
 significantly more important a decrease in depressive symptoms 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.299
 so admit that the technique is very simple to set up 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.479
 if ever 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.369
