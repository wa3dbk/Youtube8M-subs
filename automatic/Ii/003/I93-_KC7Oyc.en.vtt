course same strengths all the way but
reaction<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> different<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:24.470> then

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:36.760 

this<00:01:28.979> power<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:32.540> separated<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:35.150> directionally

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
this power is separated to directionally

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
this power is separated to directionally
it's<00:01:39.200> physical

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's physical

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's physical
failure<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:43.170> direction<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
failure this direction and this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.790 
failure this direction and this
direction

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:02:08.020 

this<00:01:49.490> direction<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.440> destruction<00:01:56.230> you<00:01:57.230> know

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.590 

this<00:02:09.160> grading<00:02:10.160> jeschill<00:02:11.950> stronger<00:02:13.690> weaker

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
this grading jeschill stronger weaker

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.550 
this grading jeschill stronger weaker
this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.210 
this
outside<00:02:20.560> vision<00:02:21.269> stronger<00:02:23.310> weaker<00:02:26.220> therefore

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
outside vision stronger weaker therefore

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.479 
outside vision stronger weaker therefore
this<00:02:28.180> better<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.420> decide

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
this better because of this decide

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:45.930 
this better because of this decide
pushing<00:02:33.489> power<00:02:38.519> goes<00:02:39.519> for<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:44.940> floating

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
pushing power goes for and this floating

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.059 
pushing power goes for and this floating
power<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.489> apex<00:02:49.030> stronger

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
power to the apex stronger

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.920 
power to the apex stronger
therefore<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:51.790> apex<00:02:52.359> goes<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.269> goes<00:02:55.269> far

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
therefore this apex goes up and goes far

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.509 
therefore this apex goes up and goes far
therefore<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:58.709> combats<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.799> are<00:03:00.099> cry<00:03:02.519> in

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
therefore this combats that are cry in

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.309 
therefore this combats that are cry in
the<00:03:04.030> shallow<00:03:05.019> layer<00:03:07.200> continuously<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:09.340> make<00:03:09.579> a

the shallow layer continuously to make a

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.849 
the shallow layer continuously to make a
good<00:03:11.319> fellow

in contrast this scan d doesn't have

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.259 
in contrast this scan d doesn't have
this<00:03:20.760> writing<00:03:21.760> effect<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:23.760> goes<00:03:24.760> deeper

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
this writing effect and goes deeper

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:32.400 
this writing effect and goes deeper
straight<00:03:25.750> down<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:31.269> can<00:03:31.480> think<00:03:31.780> it's<00:03:32.019> crazy

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
straight down you can think it's crazy

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.039 
straight down you can think it's crazy
but<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.190> my<00:03:34.470> hypothesis<00:03:36.959> thanks<00:03:37.959> for

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
but it's my hypothesis thanks for

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.419 
but it's my hypothesis thanks for
