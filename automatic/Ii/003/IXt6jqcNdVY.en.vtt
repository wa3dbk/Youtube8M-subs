Hi Everyone, Lenny Gale with Life is NOYOKE

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.340
Today, we're gonna talk about

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:06.134
how do tell the difference between

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:08.875
a Certified Reconditioned Vitamix

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.560
and a brand new Vitamix? How do you tell?

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.660
What's the difference?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.520
I have two blenders right here and we're going to

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.020
see if we can tell the difference.

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:17.877
Here we go.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:28.040
*MUSIC* Life is no f&amp;cking yoke. *MUSIC*

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.660
These Certified Reconditioned Vitamix Blenders. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.360
They're the greatest thing ever.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.180
People ask me all the time.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.920
"Do you use 'em?"

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.000
"What's wrong with them?"

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.360
"Are they gonna last?"

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.860
Well, I'm gonna try and answer that by putting

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.440
a brand new Vitamix right next to a Certified Reconditioned Vitamix.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.660
Brand new Vitamix.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.860
Certified Reconditioned Vitamix.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.900
But not necessarily in that order.

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:55.367
You don't know which is which.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200
I don't know which is which.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.880
Double blind test.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.880
Okay?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
So, if you take a look, you look at these two

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.420
you look at the outside, the faceplate

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.460
one of them is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.140
brand new, one of 'em is Certified Reconditioned.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.320
You can't tell the difference. 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.820
Brand spanking new. Shiny.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.620
You look at. Oh! And the containers, too.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.940
These are brand new. 

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:21.047
Brand new containers.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.440
And then, you look at the inside 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.400
like, if you were to inspect the inside

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.919
of the motor, they're the exact same.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.260
The exact freaking same.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.740
I'm not very good with tools and stuff like that.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.180
So, I'm not going to go in and poke around. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.640
I mean, I could.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.100
It wouldn't really do anything.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.460
I wouldn't be able to point anything out.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.600
But they're the same thing!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.580
If you open them up they'd be the exact same thing.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.020
And then, if you look at the blend quality

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.140
comparing a brand new Vitamix and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.120
a Certified Reconditioned Vitamix,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.580
they're the exact same.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.660
You can't tell the difference.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.858
Side-by-side, you can't tell the difference.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.360
Brand spankin' new. Certified Reconditioned. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
You don't know the difference.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.780
So, we're gonna blend some stuff up

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.760
with the two of these and see

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.260
if the blend quality is any different or if 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.860
it's the exact same.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.080
It's probably going to be the exact same.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.980
But I'm going to make the "Going Green" smoothie.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.360
in both of 'em.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.100
And see how they turn out.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280
Pour 'em. Drink 'em.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.880
Here we go!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.300
One more thing to note about how you can't tell

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.100
the difference between a brand new

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.240
and a Certified Reconditioned Vitamix

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.000
They all come with

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.240
and I didn't specify this, 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.740
but I should

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.680
a brand new container. 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.580
Brand new container.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.600
A brand new lid. 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.500
Brand new lid top.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.800
Brand new tamper.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.980
Brand new cookbook set. 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980
Like wrapped in plastic and everything.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.700
So all that stuff is brand new.

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:50.692
and if

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.640
if anything is not "like new,"

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.800
they make it like new.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.520
So if it's not, if there is anything wrong with it,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.760
they put a new on there.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.980
So it is new.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.453
They're really basically the same.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.720
Brand new.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.220
The only difference

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.060
and you would only be able to tell this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.580
if you called and gave them a serial number

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.180
is the length of warranty.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.020
The Certified Reconditioned Vitamix Blenders

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.740
they come with a 5-year warranty.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.260
and the brand new ones generally come with a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.960
7-year warranty.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.500
And that's not because they don't trust

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:25.753
the quality of the product

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.200
they just want to make the things less expensive.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.680
And make 'em more economical.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.440
Okay?

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:32.514
So those are the differences.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.980
But you can't tell the difference!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.900
They look freaking brand new!

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.820
You can't tell.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.140
I don't know which is which.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.760
So let's blend.

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.334
One of 'em is Certified Reconditioned.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.920
One of 'em is not.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.620
Let's blend.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.440
Let's see if we can tell.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.280
Here we go.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.600
This is the "Going Green Smoothie"

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.220
it's a Vitamix classic

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.420
 green smoothie.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.460
From the bottom

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.600
we have a little bit of water, 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.440
fresh green grapes

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.560
fresh pineapple chunks

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.340
a ton of spinach

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.020
fresh baby spinach

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.598
and then a little bit of ice

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.720
This is a full blend.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.500
We got

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.380
two Vitamix Pro 750's here,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.022
one is a Certified Reconditioned

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.680
one is a brand new one.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.020
You can't tell the difference.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.960
Let's see if we can tell a difference in how they blend.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.420
You can't tell the difference on the outside.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.300
So let's see how they blend.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.280
So we're gonna put it on the "Smoothie" setting.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.880
*BAM BAM*

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.440
Press Start and let 'er rip.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.260
Here we go. 1, 2, 3 go! 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.100
*BLENDING SOUNDS*

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.280
Wait for it, it will pull it down. Pull it down.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.200
Here we go.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.260
Here we go.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.820
*BLENDING SOUNDS*

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.780
Ohhhhhhh. Ohhhhh. 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:50.800
*BLENDING SOUNDS*   

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.560
 So it's on the "Smoothie" setting.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.580
And its running its course.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.640
You wanna let it run a full blend

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.860
to get all of the ingredients chopped up evenly.

00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:03.174
and pulverized.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.400
I have temptation to stop it early

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.553
Because, like, "Oh, it's done. It's ready to go."

00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:11.260
But you really want to let it run for its full cycle.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.080
So it will slow down. And then stop.

00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:16.694
And it's done.

00:05:16.694 --> 00:05:18.560
Look, they stopped at the same time.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.580
Oh, I can't believe it. 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.540
Look, now. You got two "Going Green" smoothies.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.540
Aright?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.840
It smells amazing. So glorious.  

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.820
Look at this. Can I pour two at once?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.980
Without spilling? I don't know!

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.960
That would be my fault, not the blenders!

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.260
Look at that! They're so amazing. 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.400
Can you tell the difference? You can't! 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.080
You can't tell the difference. Look, I'll put a couple

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.340
of blue straws in. 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.660
BOOM. 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.540
Even prettier.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.220
 Look, I'm gonna try 'em, mmm, so smooth.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.360
*MMMph.* 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.360
Oh! That's so good. I'll try this one.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.740
*mmm!* 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.700
That's so good.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.080
Wait! I'm not sure.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.420
Maybe they're not the same.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.420
*mmm* 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720
I think this one is better.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.860
*mmm* 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240
No.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.740
This one is better.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.460
*mmm* 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.640
Haha, you see what I'm doin'. 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.140
They're the same. They're both so freakin good.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.400
You can't tell the difference. 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.240
So,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.680
if you're cool with saving some cash

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:34.454
go with Certified Reconditioned. If not,

00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:36.180
get a new one! They're both awesome.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.300
They're both Vitamix Machines!

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.560
Same blend quality. 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.720
Brand new pieces. 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.000
Life is NOYOKE!  

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.240
And remember. 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.120
You're doing great. 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.920
I'm proud of you.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.380
Life is NOYOKE!  

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.160
*yum yum* *mmmm* *mmmm*     

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.480
So good. 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.480
This is invigorating.  

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.640
It really is so good.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.460
 You want a sip?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.080
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it happen.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.640
I'm gonna plug these babies in.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.400
I should have already done that.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.060
*OUTTAKE BEEP* 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.720
Okay, ready? 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.220
Action.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.020
Action. 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.860
*OUTTAKE BEEP* 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.860
I forgot to mention. 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.600
*BLAH*

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.120
*BLAH*

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.400
Ready?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.040
You're like, "I gotta go!"
