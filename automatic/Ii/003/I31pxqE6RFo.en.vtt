00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
if it's during a mission areas like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.620 
if it's during a mission areas like
these<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:37.140> considered<00:01:37.829> common<00:01:38.610> ground<00:01:39.090> for

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
these are considered common ground for

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.260 
these are considered common ground for
you<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.229> other<00:01:40.470> players<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.759> patrol

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
you and other players that are on patrol
as<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:43.020> sitting<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.619> wondering

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
as well so I'm sitting here wondering

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.780 
as well so I'm sitting here wondering
exactly<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.229> gonna<00:01:46.409> play<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.790> until

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
exactly how this is gonna play out until

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
exactly how this is gonna play out until
I<00:01:47.820> started<00:01:48.270> compiling<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.470> information

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
I started compiling all this information

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.399 
I started compiling all this information
for<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.149> vids<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
for all the other vids and then it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
for all the other vids and then it
started<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> become<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.579> clearer

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
started to become a little bit clearer

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.460 
started to become a little bit clearer
and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.290> idea

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and I think I have a pretty good idea

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.639 
and I think I have a pretty good idea
about<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.579> bungee<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.840> pull<00:01:58.170> off<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
about how bungee is gonna pull off this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
about how bungee is gonna pull off this
sword<00:01:59.009> place<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> we<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.299> look<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
sword place so if we take a look at the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.429 
sword place so if we take a look at the
sword<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.500> crota<00:02:01.950> mission<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.049> sword

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
sword of crota mission this is the sword

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.550 
sword of crota mission this is the sword
that<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.119> crota<00:02:06.560> but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that they want you to think is crota but

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.729 
that they want you to think is crota but
it's<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.020> crota

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it's really not all we know about crota

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's really not all we know about crota
so<00:02:11.099> far<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.730> he's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> night<00:02:12.959> with
