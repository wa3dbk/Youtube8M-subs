00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
lot of failures in those applications we

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.630

sort of solve some of these old problems
if<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:46.699> will<00:00:47.260> we<00:00:48.260> we<00:00:48.829> went<00:00:49.039> through<00:00:49.429> we<00:00:49.819> looked

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
if you will we we went through we looked

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.299 
if you will we we went through we looked
at<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.510> worst<00:00:50.749> case<00:00:50.960> scenario<00:00:51.469> cylinder

range of corrosion issues at some of
these<00:01:00.530> engines<00:01:00.889> have<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:01.999> we<00:01:02.089> went<00:01:02.299> away<00:01:02.359> from

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
these engines have so we went away from

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.450 
these engines have so we went away from
the<00:01:02.749> plastic<00:01:03.199> carrier<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.889> an<00:01:04.040> aluminized

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
the plastic carrier to an aluminized

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.030 
the plastic carrier to an aluminized
steel<00:01:04.640> carrier<00:01:05.330> we<00:01:05.900> also<00:01:06.080> went<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.470> an<00:01:06.619> FTM

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
steel carrier we also went to an FTM

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.640 
steel carrier we also went to an FTM
rubber<00:01:07.430> which<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.720> proprietary<00:01:09.020> rubber

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
rubber which is a proprietary rubber

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.250 
rubber which is a proprietary rubber
compound<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.369> we<00:01:10.520> developed<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.900> rubber

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
compound that we developed that rubber

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.070 
compound that we developed that rubber
will<00:01:12.680> will<00:01:13.190> live<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.520> any<00:01:13.670> environment

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
will will live in any environment

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.110 
will will live in any environment
coolant<00:01:15.080> oil<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.620> name<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:16.010> so<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:17.000> very

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
coolant oil you name it so it's very

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.060 
coolant oil you name it so it's very
well<00:01:17.390> suited<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:18.710> also<00:01:18.890> use

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
well suited for that we also use

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.490 
well suited for that we also use
multiple<00:01:19.430> sealing<00:01:20.060> beads<00:01:20.300> around<00:01:20.960> each<00:01:21.110> port

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
multiple sealing beads around each port

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.010 
multiple sealing beads around each port
so<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.890> way<00:01:22.070> if<00:01:22.580> there<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.000> some<00:01:23.150> casting<00:01:23.690> of

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
so that way if there is some casting of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.160 
so that way if there is some casting of
pinning<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:25.480> sealing<00:01:26.480> beads<00:01:26.660> will<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:26.960> on

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
pinning that sealing beads will be on

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.570 
pinning that sealing beads will be on
the<00:01:27.290> outside<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:27.950> pitting<00:01:28.310> and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
the outside of that pitting and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.100 
the outside of that pitting and
therefore<00:01:29.090> seals<00:01:29.420> some<00:01:29.630> pretty<00:01:29.840> utterly

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
therefore seals some pretty utterly

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.490 
therefore seals some pretty utterly
heads<00:01:30.460> in<00:01:31.460> addition<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:32.240> use<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.660> load

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
heads in addition to that we use a load

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.710 
heads in addition to that we use a load
stop<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.310> can't<00:01:34.580> over<00:01:34.760> tighten<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:35.270> you

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
stop so you can't over tighten it you

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600 
stop so you can't over tighten it you
can't<00:01:35.930> over<00:01:36.080> compress<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.560> gasket<00:01:37.010> one<00:01:37.520> of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
can't over compress the gasket one of

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.040 
can't over compress the gasket one of
the<00:01:37.670> problems<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.120> have<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.570> plastic

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
the problems you have with a plastic

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.800 
the problems you have with a plastic
style<00:01:39.260> gasket<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.610> without<00:01:41.360> an

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
style gasket is that without an

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.480 
style gasket is that without an
appropriate<00:01:42.260> load<00:01:42.500> stop<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:42.980> can<00:01:43.250> over

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
appropriate load stop you can over

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.310 
appropriate load stop you can over
tighten<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.910> when<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.690> over<00:01:44.900> tighten<00:01:45.110> you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
tighten it when you over tighten you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.350 
tighten it when you over tighten you
typically<00:01:45.710> will<00:01:46.010> will<00:01:46.520> break<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:46.940> carrier

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
typically will will break the carrier

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.270 
typically will will break the carrier
and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:47.750> you're<00:01:47.930> kind<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.290> off<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.130> races

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
and then you're kind of off to the races

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.580 
and then you're kind of off to the races
so<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.700> speak<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.900> we<00:01:50.990> did<00:01:51.140> come<00:01:51.290> up<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:51.440> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
so to speak so we did come up with a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.530 
so to speak so we did come up with a
number<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.920> technologies<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.940> number<00:01:53.450> of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
number of technologies a number of

number of technologies a number of
applications<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:54.560> applied<00:01:54.890> this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
applications that we applied this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.399 
applications that we applied this

with them solved a lot of problems

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.440 
with them solved a lot of problems
I<00:02:36.860> would<00:02:37.190> imagine<00:02:37.310> find<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.150> number<00:02:38.300> of

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
I would imagine find a number of

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.300 
I would imagine find a number of
technicians<00:02:38.990> that<00:02:39.140> would<00:02:39.350> say<00:02:39.560> these<00:02:40.040> are<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
technicians that would say these are the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.980 
technicians that would say these are the
only<00:02:40.460> gas<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.910> say<00:02:41.060> whatever<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.570> think<00:02:41.930> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
only gas to say whatever and think of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.380 
only gas to say whatever and think of
installing<00:02:42.350> in<00:02:42.530> those<00:02:42.650> applications<00:02:43.640> when<00:02:44.300> it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
installing in those applications when it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.700 
installing in those applications when it
comes<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.750> fill<00:02:44.960> pirai<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.380> thing<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
comes to fill pirai one thing that I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.950 
comes to fill pirai one thing that I
seem<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.010> see<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.370> lot<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.240> employ<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> lot<00:02:47.930> of
