Ouija one that was the first android
phone<00:00:36.180> phone<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.320> g1<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.239> coming<00:00:39.649> g2

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
phone phone but g1 and the coming g2

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
phone phone but g1 and the coming g2
they're<00:00:41.160> almost<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.730> same<00:00:41.850> except<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
they're almost the same except that the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.869 
they're almost the same except that the
g2<00:00:43.620> has<00:00:44.129> hasn't<00:00:45.170> such<00:00:46.170> hardware<00:00:46.980> keyboard

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
g2 has hasn't such hardware keyboard

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
g2 has hasn't such hardware keyboard
which<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.360> cool<00:00:49.039> but<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.579> slimmer

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
which is pretty cool but it's slimmer

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.470 
which is pretty cool but it's slimmer
and<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:52.199> has<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.480> internal

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and it has a little bit more internal

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.310 
and it has a little bit more internal
memory<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.590> talk<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.250> g2<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
memory and talk about the g2 but the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
memory and talk about the g2 but the
other<00:00:58.530> hardware<00:00:59.160> specifications<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.120> are

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
other hardware specifications they are

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.979 
other hardware specifications they are
almost<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.750> same<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> let's<00:01:03.120> start<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
almost the same and so let's start the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.070 
almost the same and so let's start the
first<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.100> important<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080

want to point it out is that the iphone
has<00:01:10.170> dedicated<00:01:11.119> video<00:01:12.119> control<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> called

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
has dedicated video control so called

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
has dedicated video control so called
graphic<00:01:14.580> card<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.600> pretty<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
graphic card which is pretty good and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
graphic card which is pretty good and
the<00:01:17.040> android<00:01:17.490> devices<00:01:17.820> Android<00:01:18.210> phones<00:01:18.600> like

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the android devices Android phones like

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.670 
the android devices Android phones like
g1<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> g2<00:01:21.170> they<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.500> no<00:01:23.189> graphic<00:01:23.670> cards<00:01:24.030> so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
g1 and g2 they have no graphic cards so

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
g1 and g2 they have no graphic cards so
but<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> good<00:01:25.979> thing<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
but the good thing the good thing is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.280 
but the good thing the good thing is
that<00:01:28.159> they<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.460> multi-course

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
that they have multi-course

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.039 
that they have multi-course
multiprocessors<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.909> core<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> g1

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
multiprocessors and the one core in g1

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.800 
multiprocessors and the one core in g1
and<00:01:34.290> probably<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.829> g2<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.579> dedicated<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.360> for

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and probably in g2 is dedicated only for

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.920 
and probably in g2 is dedicated only for
graphics<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> graphic<00:01:38.610> corn<00:01:38.939> but

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
graphics so they have a graphic corn but

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.539 
graphics so they have a graphic corn but
the<00:01:41.570> graphic<00:01:42.570> core<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.110> g1<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.979> g2<00:01:45.020> isn't<00:01:46.549> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the graphic core in g1 and g2 isn't so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.950 
the graphic core in g1 and g2 isn't so
good<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.860> can't<00:01:50.130> compare<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.420> graphic<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
good and you can't compare the graphic a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
good and you can't compare the graphic a
single<00:01:52.530> graphic<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.130> single<00:01:53.579> graphic

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.760 
graphic in the iphone is much sharper
and<00:02:43.470> brighter<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.830> edits<00:02:45.550> color<00:02:46.050> well<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.410> 16

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
and brighter and edits color well the 16

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.100 
and brighter and edits color well the 16
million<00:02:47.950> course<00:02:48.390> are<00:02:49.390> better<00:02:50.050> than<00:02:51.150> 64,000<00:02:52.150> so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
million course are better than 64,000 so

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.320 
million course are better than 64,000 so
you<00:02:54.070> can<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> math<00:02:55.450> again<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.760> third

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
you can do the math again and the third

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.750 
you can do the math again and the third
round<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:59.070> the<00:03:00.070> memory<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.840> iphone<00:03:02.680> 3g<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
round is the memory on the iphone 3g you

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.800 
round is the memory on the iphone 3g you
have<00:03:03.820> 8<00:03:04.810> or<00:03:05.310> 16<00:03:06.310> gigabytes<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.270> free<00:03:07.510> memory

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
have 8 or 16 gigabytes of free memory

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.650 
have 8 or 16 gigabytes of free memory
and<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.340> install<00:03:09.700> application<00:03:10.420> and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
and you can install application and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.960 
and you can install application and
games<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:12.489> memory<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.040> under<00:03:15.730> on

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
games in this memory and in the under on

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.920 
games in this memory and in the under on
the<00:03:16.030> g1<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.080> g2<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:18.489> have<00:03:18.700> only<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.420> internal

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the g1 and g2 you have only the internal

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.930 
the g1 and g2 you have only the internal
memory<00:03:20.260> which<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.940> g1<00:03:22.480> 60<00:03:23.110> megabytes

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
memory which is in g1 60 megabytes

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.780 
memory which is in g1 60 megabytes
approximately<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:26.110> g2<00:03:26.940> well<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.269> could<00:03:28.600> be

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
approximately and in g2 well it could be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.110 
approximately and in g2 well it could be
400<00:03:30.790> megabytes<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.100> can<00:03:33.370> install<00:03:33.820> apps

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
400 megabytes but you can install apps

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.740 
400 megabytes but you can install apps
and<00:03:34.450> games<00:03:35.290> only<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> internal<00:03:36.730> memory<00:03:37.209> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and games only in the internal memory so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.890 
and games only in the internal memory so
you<00:03:38.170> can't<00:03:38.560> install<00:03:39.280> apps<00:03:39.580> on<00:03:39.940> games<00:03:40.239> in<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
you can't install apps on games in the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.759 
you can't install apps on games in the
external<00:03:41.590> memory<00:03:41.950> extra<00:03:42.730> memory<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.290> in

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
external memory extra memory in the in

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.280 
external memory extra memory in the in
the<00:03:44.799> SD<00:03:45.220> card<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.090> have<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.720> very<00:03:47.080> limited

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
the SD card so you have a very limited

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.580 
the SD card so you have a very limited
amount<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:48.549> space<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:50.080> games<00:03:50.350> for

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
amount of space and the games for

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.570 
amount of space and the games for
android<00:03:50.799> are<00:03:51.340> smaller<00:03:52.290> smaller<00:03:53.290> than<00:03:53.860> the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
android are smaller smaller than the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.020 
android are smaller smaller than the
games<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.000> iphone<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:56.850> because<00:03:57.850> there's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
games for iphone and because there's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.229 
games for iphone and because there's
more<00:03:58.390> they<00:03:58.989> don't<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.640> many<00:04:00.640> features<00:04:01.209> and

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
more they don't have many features and

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.320 
more they don't have many features and
so<00:04:04.239> cool<00:04:04.600> graphics<00:04:05.049> like<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.610> iphone<00:04:07.030> games

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
so cool graphics like the iphone games

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330 
so cool graphics like the iphone games
and<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.299> round<00:04:10.570> free<00:04:11.040> iPhone<00:04:12.040> wins

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
and so this is round free iPhone wins

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.030 
and so this is round free iPhone wins
again<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:14.079> next<00:04:14.620> round<00:04:16.380> g<00:04:17.380> one<00:04:17.590> will<00:04:17.829> be<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
again so I next round g one will be the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.140 
again so I next round g one will be the
winner<00:04:18.220> because<00:04:19.090> he<00:04:19.780> has<00:04:20.729> hardware

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
winner because he has hardware

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.590 
winner because he has hardware
keyboard<00:04:22.570> so<00:04:23.440> much<00:04:23.680> buttons<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.600> hardware

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
keyboard so much buttons and hardware

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.740 
keyboard so much buttons and hardware
joystiq<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.160> phone<00:04:27.759> has<00:04:28.120> no<00:04:28.330> hardware

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
joystiq so I phone has no hardware

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.180 
joystiq so I phone has no hardware
buttons<00:04:29.110> well<00:04:30.120> okay<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.449> has<00:04:32.050> some<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:32.800> they

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
buttons well okay it has some but they

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.240 
buttons well okay it has some but they
are<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.370> meant<00:04:33.699> for<00:04:34.660> 4<00:04:35.050> gameplay<00:04:35.320> although

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
are not meant for 4 gameplay although

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.290 
are not meant for 4 gameplay although
you<00:04:36.310> can<00:04:36.699> play<00:04:37.389> games<00:04:38.460> with<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.759> built-in

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
you can play games with the built-in

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.480 
you can play games with the built-in
accelerometer<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:43.410> in<00:04:44.410> this<00:04:44.770> round<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.460> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
accelerometer but in this round to the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.100 
accelerometer but in this round to the
the<00:04:46.060> g1<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.410> winner<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:48.210> g2<00:04:49.210> will<00:04:49.870> not

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
the g1 is the winner but g2 will not

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.700 
the g1 is the winner but g2 will not
have<00:04:50.650> hardware<00:04:51.070> keyboard<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:52.590> think<00:04:53.590> again

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
have hardware keyboard so think again

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.960 
have hardware keyboard so think again
who's<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.789> winner<00:04:55.590> so<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.190> last<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:57.669> about

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
who's the winner so the last think about

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.930 
who's the winner so the last think about
discuss<00:04:58.419> is<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:59.289> game<00:04:59.680> titles<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.820> game

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
discuss is the game titles are the game

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.710 
discuss is the game titles are the game
titles<00:05:01.419> so<00:05:02.289> first<00:05:02.710> of<00:05:02.860> all<00:05:02.949> iphone<00:05:03.610> has<00:05:04.330> many

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
titles so first of all iphone has many

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.040 
titles so first of all iphone has many
games<00:05:05.020> free<00:05:05.680> or<00:05:05.979> paid<00:05:06.490> has<00:05:07.210> many<00:05:07.510> good<00:05:07.780> games

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
games free or paid has many good games

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.760 
games free or paid has many good games
and<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:10.320> android<00:05:11.320> operation<00:05:12.039> system<00:05:12.570> hasn't

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and the android operation system hasn't

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.659 
and the android operation system hasn't
so<00:05:14.770> many<00:05:14.979> games<00:05:15.870> because<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.229> new<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:18.070> let's

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
so many games because it's new so let's

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.240 
so many games because it's new so let's
view<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:18.910> chance<00:05:19.470> but<00:05:20.470> in<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.949> other<00:05:20.979> hand

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
view the chance but in the other hand

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.390 
view the chance but in the other hand
the<00:05:22.180> games<00:05:22.690> for<00:05:22.960> android<00:05:23.139> are<00:05:23.620> much<00:05:24.130> much

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
the games for android are much much

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.490 
the games for android are much much
smaller<00:05:24.669> than<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.599> gates<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:26.020> iphone

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
smaller than the gates for iphone

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.029 
smaller than the gates for iphone
because<00:05:27.039> once<00:05:27.940> again<00:05:28.120> here<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.590> have<00:05:29.770> less

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
because once again here you have less

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.450 
because once again here you have less
space<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:31.180> have<00:05:31.210> up<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.289> 17<00:05:32.860> megabytes<00:05:33.310> of

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
space you have up to 17 megabytes of

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.159 
space you have up to 17 megabytes of
free<00:05:33.669> space<00:05:33.880> for<00:05:34.120> all<00:05:34.630> your<00:05:34.960> applications

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
free space for all your applications

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.730 
free space for all your applications
games<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.460> data<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:39.180> I've<00:05:40.180> heard<00:05:40.930> about<00:05:41.169> games

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
games and data so I've heard about games

my g1 it's it's it's has only a limited
amount<00:05:57.639> of<00:05:57.909> space<00:05:58.050> so<00:06:00.120> this<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.199> some
