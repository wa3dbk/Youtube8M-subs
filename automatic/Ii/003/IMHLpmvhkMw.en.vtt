they're<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.890> two<00:02:02.070> wheels<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.579> we

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
they're going to be two wheels but we

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730 
they're going to be two wheels but we
don't<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.149> any<00:02:03.329> need<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.439> that's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
don't have any need for that so that's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
don't have any need for that so that's
really<00:02:04.890> simple<00:02:05.460> alright<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.479> now<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.930> got

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
really simple alright so now that we got

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
really simple alright so now that we got
the<00:02:07.259> number<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.710> wheels<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.879> our

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the number of wheels that we want our

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
the number of wheels that we want our
picker<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.420> create<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:10.229> else<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.530> need

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
picker to create what else do we need

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.170 
picker to create what else do we need
well<00:02:11.430> there's<00:02:11.670> another<00:02:12.000> method<00:02:12.360> over

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
well there's another method over

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.220 
well there's another method over
go<00:02:13.569> ahead<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.930> grab<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:15.480> copy<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.959> paste

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
go ahead and grab this copy and paste

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.959 
go ahead and grab this copy and paste
and<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.530> reason<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.069> typing<00:02:18.489> these<00:02:18.670> out

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
and the reason I'm not typing these out

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.670 
and the reason I'm not typing these out
is<00:02:19.269> because<00:02:19.659> I<00:02:19.870> don't<00:02:19.930> need<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.230> type<00:02:20.409> them<00:02:20.620> out

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
is because I don't need to type them out

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.740 
is because I don't need to type them out
they're<00:02:20.890> built<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.430> methods<00:02:21.640> from<00:02:22.510> our

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
they're built in methods from our

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470 
they're built in methods from our
delegate<00:02:23.469> and<00:02:23.590> data<00:02:23.829> source<00:02:24.189> that<00:02:24.879> says<00:02:24.909> all

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
delegate and data source that says all

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.890 
delegate and data source that says all
right<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.560> how<00:02:26.799> you<00:02:27.219> should<00:02:27.280> make<00:02:27.609> your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
right this is how you should make your

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.589 
right this is how you should make your
Pickers<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.469> what<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.159> one<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.609> is<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.420> one

if we go back later and add some more
strings<00:03:04.719> to<00:03:04.870> here<00:03:05.079> then<00:03:05.319> it's<00:03:05.439> going<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
strings to here then it's going to be

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.289 
strings to here then it's going to be
messed<00:03:05.889> up<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.489> what<00:03:06.639> we<00:03:06.819> wanted<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.090> do<00:03:07.180> is

each<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.590> those<00:04:45.860> rows<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.639> put<00:04:47.000> apples<00:04:47.479> in

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
each of those rows and put apples in

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.200 
each of those rows and put apples in
each<00:04:47.930> one<00:04:48.199> well<00:04:49.010> I<00:04:49.040> mean<00:04:49.340> that's<00:04:49.490> great<00:04:49.729> now<00:04:50.030> if

object at the array object at index row

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.790 
object at the array object at index row
so<00:05:08.240> what<00:05:08.449> this<00:05:08.570> is<00:05:08.750> going<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.930> do<00:05:09.169> is<00:05:09.410> say<00:05:09.590> all

about if I want to put a title in for
the<00:05:27.289> third<00:05:27.560> element<00:05:27.800> then<00:05:28.460> they<00:05:28.639> get<00:05:28.760> to

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
the third element then they get to

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.110 
the third element then they get to
picker<00:05:29.330> object<00:05:30.020> at<00:05:30.169> array<00:05:30.590> 2<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:31.940> would

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
picker object at array 2 and that would

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.870 
picker object at array 2 and that would
be<00:05:32.530> apples<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.220> is<00:05:34.310> pretty<00:05:34.430> much<00:05:34.639> what's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
be apples so this is pretty much what's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.520 
be apples so this is pretty much what's
happening<00:05:35.300> when<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.599> create<00:05:35.870> your<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:36.020> you

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
happening when you create your a you

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.040 
happening when you create your a you
first<00:05:36.770> have<00:05:36.950> to<00:05:36.979> give<00:05:37.160> how<00:05:37.580> many<00:05:38.300> wheels<00:05:38.750> they

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
first have to give how many wheels they

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.870 
first have to give how many wheels they
want<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.320> draw<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:39.650> want<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:39.889> draw<00:05:40.039> one<00:05:40.250> then

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
want to draw we want to draw one then

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.909 
want to draw we want to draw one then
you<00:05:41.030> say<00:05:41.180> all<00:05:41.360> right<00:05:41.479> how<00:05:42.080> many<00:05:42.320> rows<00:05:42.620> do<00:05:42.860> you

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
you say all right how many rows do you

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.710 
you say all right how many rows do you
want<00:05:43.130> in<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.250> wheel<00:05:43.550> well<00:05:44.000> we<00:05:44.180> want<00:05:44.389> however

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
want in that wheel well we want however

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.260 
want in that wheel well we want however
many<00:05:45.139> is<00:05:45.320> in<00:05:45.470> our<00:05:45.620> array<00:05:45.830> obviously<00:05:46.400> then<00:05:47.000> for

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
many is in our array obviously then for

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.909 
many is in our array obviously then for
each<00:05:47.539> of<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.930> elements<00:05:48.440> when<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.710> loops

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
each of the elements when it loops

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.150 
each of the elements when it loops
through<00:05:49.010> one<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:49.490> creating<00:05:50.060> your<00:05:50.810> picker<00:05:51.590> it's

just<00:06:26.990> like<00:06:27.110> that<00:06:27.289> so<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:28.010> works<00:06:28.280> all<00:06:28.520> fine

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
just like that so that works all fine

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.540 
just like that so that works all fine
and<00:06:29.180> dandy<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.599> whenever<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:30.650> first<00:06:30.979> was

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
and dandy and whenever I first was

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.080 
and dandy and whenever I first was
working<00:06:31.880> with<00:06:32.000> this<00:06:32.150> I<00:06:32.300> was<00:06:32.360> like<00:06:32.539> alright<00:06:32.919> so

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
working with this I was like alright so

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.520 
working with this I was like alright so
if<00:06:35.090> you're<00:06:35.300> doing<00:06:35.570> this<00:06:35.690> all<00:06:35.960> right<00:06:36.260> this

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
if you're doing this all right this

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.320 
if you're doing this all right this
method<00:06:36.950> gets<00:06:37.190> called<00:06:37.280> once

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
method gets called once

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.700 
method gets called once
so<00:06:38.599> you're<00:06:38.750> passing<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.200> 1

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
so you're passing a 1

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.640 
so you're passing a 1
in<00:06:40.070> one<00:06:40.490> row<00:06:40.760> so<00:06:41.270> how<00:06:41.480> does<00:06:41.540> it<00:06:41.720> know<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.020> return

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
in one row so how does it know to return

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.700 
in one row so how does it know to return
the<00:06:43.490> stuff<00:06:44.240> for<00:06:44.480> every<00:06:44.870> single<00:06:45.200> I<00:06:45.380> mean<00:06:45.560> like

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
the stuff for every single I mean like

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.410 
the stuff for every single I mean like
five<00:06:46.070> times<00:06:46.370> or<00:06:46.580> twenty<00:06:46.910> times<00:06:46.940> or<00:06:47.300> however

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
five times or twenty times or however

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.450 
five times or twenty times or however
many<00:06:47.690> times<00:06:47.780> does<00:06:48.230> this<00:06:48.380> well<00:06:48.920> the<00:06:49.040> cool<00:06:49.220> thing

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
many times does this well the cool thing

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.580 
many times does this well the cool thing
about<00:06:49.550> delegate<00:06:50.210> methods<00:06:50.540> is<00:06:50.780> they<00:06:51.380> get

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
about delegate methods is they get

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.520 
about delegate methods is they get
called<00:06:51.940> automatically<00:06:52.940> as<00:06:53.090> needed<00:06:53.780> so<00:06:54.260> this

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
called automatically as needed so this

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.170 
called automatically as needed so this
method<00:06:54.770> is<00:06:55.040> actually<00:06:55.520> going<00:06:55.700> to<00:06:55.790> be<00:06:55.880> called

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
method is actually going to be called

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.840 
method is actually going to be called
five<00:06:56.570> times<00:06:56.600> and<00:06:57.230> how<00:06:57.860> do<00:06:57.920> we<00:06:58.070> know<00:06:58.190> that<00:06:58.220> we

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
five times and how do we know that we

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.610 
five times and how do we know that we
don't<00:06:58.940> even<00:06:59.180> need<00:06:59.360> to<00:06:59.450> know<00:06:59.660> it<00:06:59.810> it's<00:06:59.960> built<00:07:00.350> in

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
don't even need to know it it's built in

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.430 
don't even need to know it it's built in
to<00:07:00.940> iPhone<00:07:01.940> development<00:07:02.390> so<00:07:02.900> these<00:07:03.230> pretty

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
to iPhone development so these pretty

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.740 
to iPhone development so these pretty
much<00:07:03.560> take<00:07:03.950> all<00:07:04.160> the<00:07:04.460> confusing<00:07:04.880> aspects<00:07:05.600> out

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
much take all the confusing aspects out

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.990 
much take all the confusing aspects out
for<00:07:05.960> you<00:07:06.080> and<00:07:06.290> this<00:07:07.250> is<00:07:07.400> pretty<00:07:07.580> much<00:07:07.760> how<00:07:07.970> you

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
for you and this is pretty much how you

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.220 
for you and this is pretty much how you
build<00:07:08.980> simply<00:07:10.210> really<00:07:11.210> simple<00:07:11.600> methods<00:07:12.020> to

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
build simply really simple methods to

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.500 
build simply really simple methods to
build<00:07:12.470> your<00:07:12.620> picker<00:07:12.890> so<00:07:13.520> pretty<00:07:13.910> much<00:07:14.090> saying

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 
build your picker so pretty much saying

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.180 
build your picker so pretty much saying
