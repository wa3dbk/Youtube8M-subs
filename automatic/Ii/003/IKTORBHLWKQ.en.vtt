00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.630 
can see it's fairly clean there's just
one<00:01:27.909> little<00:01:28.240> scratch<00:01:28.630> here<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:30.280> how<00:01:30.460> well

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
one little scratch here know how well

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.230 
one little scratch here know how well
you<00:01:30.790> can<00:01:30.820> see<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.940> there's<00:01:33.940> this

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
you can see that and there's this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.360 
you can see that and there's this
scratch<00:01:34.659> here<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.080> wish<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.530> wasn't<00:01:35.740> there<00:01:36.130> but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
scratch here I wish it wasn't there but

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.690 
scratch here I wish it wasn't there but
it<00:01:36.549> is<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.930> touch-up<00:01:38.530> paint<00:01:38.799> should<00:01:39.040> do<00:01:39.580> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it is well touch-up paint should do the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.680 
it is well touch-up paint should do the
trick<00:01:39.909> there<00:01:40.180> but<00:01:40.860> there<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:41.950> go

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
trick there but there we go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.660 
trick there but there we go
so<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.720> did<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.260> running<00:01:44.860> about<00:01:45.340> an<00:01:45.520> hour

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
so I did have it running about an hour

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.930 
so I did have it running about an hour
ago<00:01:46.000> briefly<00:01:46.780> for<00:01:47.290> about<00:01:47.650> oh<00:01:50.280> five<00:01:51.280> minutes<00:01:51.790> or

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
ago briefly for about oh five minutes or

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.149 
ago briefly for about oh five minutes or
so<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.510> might<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:53.020> somewhat<00:01:53.500> warmed<00:01:53.979> up

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
so so it might be somewhat warmed up

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.170 
so so it might be somewhat warmed up
there<00:01:57.159> goes
