00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
that it integrates it in the operating

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.680 
that it integrates it in the operating
system<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.269> an<00:03:21.390> apple

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
system and because it's an apple

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.140 
system and because it's an apple
standard<00:03:22.080> it'll<00:03:22.800> be<00:03:22.920> readily<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.610> just

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
standard it'll be readily I'm just
