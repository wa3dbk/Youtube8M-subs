they'll<00:01:37.079> spawn<00:01:37.729> then<00:01:38.729> they're<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.090> move

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
they'll spawn then they're gonna move

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
they'll spawn then they're gonna move
back<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> main<00:01:40.619> lake<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> guess

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
back out on the main lake so I guess

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.130 
back out on the main lake so I guess
what<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.729> need<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.450> give<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
what I really need to do is give you a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
what I really need to do is give you a
forward<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:43.979> at<00:01:44.100> where<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:44.490> fish<00:01:44.729> are

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
forward look at where these fish are

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
forward look at where these fish are
going<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> time<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.619> they're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
going by the time you get here they're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
going by the time you get here they're
probably<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.700> finish<00:01:47.970> their

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
probably going to have finish their

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.630 
probably going to have finish their
spawn<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.810> you'll<00:01:49.649> need<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> keep<00:01:50.159> pretty

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
spawn and you'll need to keep pretty

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.569 
spawn and you'll need to keep pretty
much<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> spinning<00:01:52.470> tackle<00:01:53.070> handy

you're gonna be fishing on this lake so

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.440 
you're gonna be fishing on this lake so
that's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.350> real<00:02:53.100> good<00:02:53.430> rig<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:53.880> doing<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.240> I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's a real good rig for doing this I

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.060 
that's a real good rig for doing this I
also<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.380> catch<00:02:55.560> some<00:02:55.590> fish<00:02:55.800> on

also think you can catch some fish on

enough<00:02:57.780> water<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.350> think<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.800> see

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
