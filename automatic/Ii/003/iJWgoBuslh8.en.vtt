00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.179
 news we will talk about the update 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.800
 of the summoner's crack that for the 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.410
 people who do not know has already been added 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.900

 caylyn hunter of heads you see how 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.479
 It's cool to me I like the scj and the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.629
 I truly believe that I bought it without 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.979
 think it's 975 riot points is 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.239
 to tell you how good the particles 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.690
 we will see later with the skills but 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.489
 they have been modified somewhat the w and will cost 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.140
 975 redpoint yes so let's go to 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.689
 see both the skills and the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.360
 animations and the new turn based on 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:02.680
 this skin of caijing we begin by the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.879
 first is to tell you that the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.619
 animations themselves have not been 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.600
 modified good we see how the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.159
 weapon but what has most modified with 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.210
 new particles and everything is the turn 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.090
 base that we will see below 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.470
 after reviewing said animations 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.730
 finally let's see the laughter 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.460
 there we have it and now the base turn 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.260
 look back that is very cool the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.020
 hologram that comes out like you put the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.329
 helmet and 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.369
 we go to the base, let's go see the 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.649
 good skills let's start with the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.430
 basic attack fix here we have it 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.710
 there we also see the passive 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.870
 the particles have been modified and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.570
 let's see what's going to be pretty amazing 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.280
 because I like very much to notice 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.600
 we see how that weapon opens up and has 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.120
 well then the details also of the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.800
 skin that I think is beautiful you know 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.780
 of more or less of the same series as the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.300
 nesting skin and head hunter 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.190
 let's see the w tell you that the w in this 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420
 case has not been modified yet 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.600
 has a particle yes it is true that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 It has a kind of hologram, but not 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 well I think they're still going to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.130
 modify also what is the trap in 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.040
 yes that goes according to the weapon and with the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.380
 head hunter clothes let's go 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.190
 to come a little closer to see the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.220
 we also see modified following the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.640
 skin fence and finally let's see the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.720
 ultimate 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 amazing my mother I love this skin 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.650
 975 riot points and finally let's see the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.650
 death of caylee 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 there we have it as many of you already know 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.690
 we have available in the crack of the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.790
 invoker in the server pe of the improvement 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.319
 The truth is that it is very cool and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.880
 we have seen it in the live one that you make 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.230
 this morning in the channel just in case 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.790
 you have not seen it, you also have a 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.050
 link in the description and in the same 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.660
 screen so you do not miss detail 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.310
 everything we saw on the tour of the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.319
 crack in which we find the spoiler 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 we saw absolutely everything that did not 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.410
 we had seen in the videos of the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.420
 readers the truth is that we made a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.310
 thorough exploration and the truth is that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.780
 I loved it, tell me what you 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.580
 is appearing and that would improve and 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.680
 especially to the summoner's crack 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.690
 things I needed to know what the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.920
 community is also to tell you that what 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.360
 long these days I'm going to make a 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.700
 kind of special coverage which 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.590
 when they go adding different 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.480

 logically a kind of 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.390
 compilations in which we see all 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.560
 the changes that are adding missing 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.630
 still the audio of the sellers 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.670
 are missing enough things to improve images 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.440
 icons of the jungle monsters 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.890
