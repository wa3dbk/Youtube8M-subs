my<00:00:18.669> name's<00:00:18.820> eric<00:00:19.179> berg<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.689> we<00:00:20.499> just<00:00:20.679> did<00:00:20.800> they

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
my name's eric berg and we just did they

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.130 
my name's eric berg and we just did they
employed<00:00:21.249> craft<00:00:21.519> challenge<00:00:21.970> where<00:00:22.839> we<00:00:22.990> were

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
employed craft challenge where we were

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.130 
employed craft challenge where we were
given<00:00:23.579> secret<00:00:24.579> objects<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:25.300> i<00:00:25.390> had<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.660> make<00:00:25.839> a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
given secret objects and i had to make a

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.339 
given secret objects and i had to make a
fabric<00:00:26.980> pattern<00:00:27.369> it<00:00:28.060> was<00:00:28.210> really<00:00:28.449> hard<00:00:28.810> it<00:00:29.169> got

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
fabric pattern it was really hard it got

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.439 
fabric pattern it was really hard it got
down<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.890> wire<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.609> was<00:00:30.999> just<00:00:31.150> cutting

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
down to the wire I was just cutting

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.750 
down to the wire I was just cutting
things<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.290> gluing<00:00:32.650> things<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.310> my<00:00:33.460> hands

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
things and gluing things and my hands

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.470 
things and gluing things and my hands
were<00:00:33.910> cramping<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.870> I<00:00:34.990> was<00:00:35.170> just<00:00:35.200> so<00:00:35.950> focused

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
were cramping and I was just so focused

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.020 
were cramping and I was just so focused
but<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:37.750> think<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.170> made<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.620> best<00:00:38.950> event<00:00:39.340> my

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
but I think I made the best event my

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.550 
but I think I made the best event my
design<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:41.520> probably<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.910> most<00:00:43.560> important

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
design is probably the most important

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.800 
design is probably the most important
thing<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.310> have<00:00:45.400> happened<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:46.030> area<00:00:46.480> in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
thing to have happened in this area in

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.100 
thing to have happened in this area in
recent<00:00:47.350> history<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:48.070> hope<00:00:48.820> I<00:00:49.000> win<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:49.780> my

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
recent history I hope I win and my

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.400 
recent history I hope I win and my
designs<00:00:50.530> very<00:00:50.800> colorful<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.520> innovative<00:00:52.410> my

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
designs very colorful and innovative my

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.930 
designs very colorful and innovative my
inspiration<00:00:53.770> was<00:00:54.550> spring<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.620> I'm<00:00:57.370> getting

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
inspiration was spring but I'm getting

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.400 
inspiration was spring but I'm getting
really<00:00:58.090> nervous<00:00:58.210> because<00:00:58.780> it's<00:00:59.080> been<00:00:59.260> really

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
really nervous because it's been really

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.230 
really nervous because it's been really
cold<00:00:59.800> here<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.730> think<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:01.030> might<00:01:01.210> have

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
cold here and I think I might have

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.170 
cold here and I think I might have
forgotten<00:01:01.750> what<00:01:02.140> spring<00:01:02.560> even<00:01:02.830> looks<00:01:03.160> like<00:01:03.460> if

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
forgotten what spring even looks like if

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.029 
forgotten what spring even looks like if
the<00:01:04.390> staff<00:01:04.719> challenge<00:01:05.170> was<00:01:05.289> an<00:01:05.409> animal<00:01:05.679> it

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
the staff challenge was an animal it

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.090 
the staff challenge was an animal it
would<00:01:06.159> probably<00:01:06.399> be<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.999> Griffin<00:01:07.960> because<00:01:08.799> it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
would probably be a Griffin because it's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.010 
would probably be a Griffin because it's
so<00:01:09.700> many<00:01:09.880> different<00:01:10.060> things<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.810> don't

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
so many different things you don't

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.399 
so many different things you don't
expect<00:01:11.079> it<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.770> be<00:01:12.460> one<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:13.060> think<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.200> would<00:01:14.380> be

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
expect it to be one I think it would be

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.410 
expect it to be one I think it would be
a<00:01:15.390> cheetah<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:17.710> was<00:01:17.829> very<00:01:18.130> rapid<00:01:18.609> but

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
a cheetah because it was very rapid but

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.709 
a cheetah because it was very rapid but
it<00:01:19.509> was<00:01:19.600> also<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.920> excited<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:26.369> size<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:28.119> was

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
it was also very excited any size I was

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.660 
it was also very excited any size I was
so<00:01:28.869> stressed<00:01:29.109> that<00:01:29.350> i'ma<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.249> but

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so stressed that i'ma it to you but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.669 
so stressed that i'ma it to you but
I<00:01:30.880> did<00:01:31.030> not<00:01:31.179> have<00:01:31.329> time<00:01:31.479> for<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.469> I'm

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
I did not have time for that I just I'm

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.129 
I did not have time for that I just I'm
not<00:01:32.740> even<00:01:33.280> sure<00:01:33.310> if<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.969> says<00:01:34.450> spring

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
not even sure if it really says spring

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:38.099 
not even sure if it really says spring
like<00:01:35.380> if<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.649> really<00:01:36.069> speaks<00:01:36.749> and<00:01:37.749> just<00:01:37.990> like

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
like if it really speaks and just like

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.370 
like if it really speaks and just like
screams<00:01:38.590> spring<00:01:39.210> huh<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.990> greatest

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
screams spring huh it's the greatest

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.039 
screams spring huh it's the greatest
design<00:01:41.889> that<00:01:42.310> I've<00:01:42.490> ever<00:01:42.759> done<00:01:43.030> it's<00:01:43.719> the

amount of time it can be great it was a

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500 
amount of time it can be great it was a
good<00:01:56.800> challenge<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.580> try<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.030> make<00:01:58.180> stuff

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510
