that information was going to get out
there<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.420> Electronic<00:01:58.020> Arts<00:01:58.229> knew<00:01:59.130> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

the entire time but didn't tell anybody

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
the entire time but didn't tell anybody
so<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.950> stock<00:02:02.159> prices<00:02:02.610> continued<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> rise<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
so the stock prices continued to rise so

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
then they were going to get the most

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.150 
then they were going to get the most
amount<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.250> money<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:09.170> EA<00:02:10.170> has<00:02:10.649> responded
