obviously pop the hood it's very very
easy<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:29.289> replace<00:00:29.590> one<00:00:29.830> of<00:00:29.860> these<00:00:30.010> light<00:00:30.250> bulbs

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
easy to replace one of these light bulbs

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.100 
easy to replace one of these light bulbs
so<00:00:30.850> if<00:00:31.420> you<00:00:31.510> look<00:00:31.690> down<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:31.930> here<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.750> can<00:00:34.930> see

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
so if you look down in here you can see

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.520 
so if you look down in here you can see
the<00:00:35.260> switch<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:37.090> is<00:00:37.120> already<00:00:37.540> unplugged<00:00:38.199> if

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
the switch which is already unplugged if

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.639 
the switch which is already unplugged if
you<00:00:38.680> can<00:00:38.830> see<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.449> okay<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:41.290> end<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.560> the

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
you can see that okay and the end of the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.380 
you can see that okay and the end of the
bulb<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.130> slides<00:00:42.430> right<00:00:42.610> into<00:00:43.030> that<00:00:43.180> and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
bulb just slides right into that and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.910 
bulb just slides right into that and
pops<00:00:43.600> right<00:00:43.840> out<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.530> then<00:00:44.739> this

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
pops right out of it and then this

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.270 
pops right out of it and then this
switch<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.840> goes<00:00:47.110> into<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.590> light<00:00:47.770> socket

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
switch which goes into the light socket

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.650 
switch which goes into the light socket
in<00:00:48.430> here<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.110> see<00:00:50.290> there<00:00:51.360> it'll<00:00:52.360> just

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
in here as you can see there it'll just

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.440 
in here as you can see there it'll just
turn<00:00:52.870> clockwise<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.590> tighten<00:00:54.160> it<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.610> then

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
turn clockwise to tighten it and then

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.470 
turn clockwise to tighten it and then
counterclockwise<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:57.700> go<00:00:57.850> ahead<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.180> loosen

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
counterclockwise to go ahead and loosen

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.299 
counterclockwise to go ahead and loosen
it<00:00:58.600> if<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.930> need<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.170> loosen<00:00:59.380> it<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.620> put<00:01:00.129> in<00:01:00.219> a

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
it if you need to loosen it to put in a

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.650 
it if you need to loosen it to put in a
new<00:01:00.430> bulb<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:00.879> just<00:01:01.059> don't<00:01:01.210> want<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.390> touch

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
new bulb you just don't want to touch

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.959 
new bulb you just don't want to touch
the<00:01:02.020> filament<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:02.800> real<00:01:03.070> important<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:03.730> anyway

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
the filament so real important so anyway

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.520 
the filament so real important so anyway
show<00:01:04.509> a<00:01:04.540> little<00:01:04.750> bit<00:01:04.869> more<00:01:04.930> here<00:01:05.229> in<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.440> a

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
show a little bit more here in just a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.810 
show a little bit more here in just a
second

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.870 

so<00:01:15.820> there's<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.180> bulb<00:01:16.420> in<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.840> switch<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
so there's the bulb in the switch you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.400 
so there's the bulb in the switch you
can<00:01:19.000> see<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.300> right<00:01:19.390> there<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.930> socket

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
can see it right there in the socket

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.500 
can see it right there in the socket
that<00:01:20.980> is<00:01:21.010> just<00:01:21.400> snaps<00:01:21.700> right<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.120> those<00:01:22.300> two

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
that is just snaps right in those two

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.840 
that is just snaps right in those two
prongs<00:01:22.870> very<00:01:23.170> very<00:01:23.440> easy<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.580> now<00:01:24.670> we're<00:01:24.820> just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
prongs very very easy so now we're just

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.520 
prongs very very easy so now we're just
going<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.150> slide<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:26.020> know<00:01:26.080> it's<00:01:26.320> hard

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
going to slide it and I know it's hard

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.960 
going to slide it and I know it's hard
to<00:01:26.590> see<00:01:26.860> but<00:01:27.190> it's<00:01:27.310> going<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.520> go<00:01:27.610> right<00:01:27.820> in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
to see but it's going to go right in

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.180 
to see but it's going to go right in
that<00:01:28.410> socket<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.500> then<00:01:29.590> we're<00:01:29.740> going<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.890> turn

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
that socket and then we're going to turn

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.970 
that socket and then we're going to turn
it<00:01:30.340> clockwise<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:31.380> that'll<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.710> and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
it clockwise and that'll be that and

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.090 
it clockwise and that'll be that and
we'll<00:01:33.100> see<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.580> works

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.399 

all<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.049> everything

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
all right so now you can see everything

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
all right so now you can see everything
is<00:01:40.500> working<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> hard<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> see

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is working and it is kind of hard to see

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940 
is working and it is kind of hard to see
in<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.080> might<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.259> able<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in here you might be able to see this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.430 
in here you might be able to see this
one<00:01:47.159> better<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.210> side<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.840> far<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.259> how

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
one better on this side as far as how

00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:00.770 
one better on this side as far as how
how<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> bulb<00:01:50.490> sits<00:01:50.940> in<00:01:54.290> but<00:01:59.390> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.570> see

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
how the bulb sits in but you can see

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
how the bulb sits in but you can see
there<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> slide<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.310> into

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
there and it just when you slide it into

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.910 
there and it just when you slide it into
that<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:06.090> area

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that little area

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.430 
that little area
yep<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.880> turn<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.319> maybe<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
yep just you just turn it maybe a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.830 
yep just you just turn it maybe a
quarter<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.160> turn<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.600> fit

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
quarter of a turn and it they don't fit

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.020 
quarter of a turn and it they don't fit
in<00:02:12.959> there<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.380> super<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.340> they<00:02:14.489> don't<00:02:14.640> snap

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
in there like super like they don't snap

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.780 
in there like super like they don't snap
in<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.569> kind<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.050> seats<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.160> as<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.489> turn

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
in it just kind of seats in as you turn

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.090 
in it just kind of seats in as you turn
it<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:19.790> very<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.120> straightforward<00:02:22.100> really

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
it so very very straightforward really

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.740 
it so very very straightforward really
easy<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.030> everything<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.600> these

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
easy to get to everything with these

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430 
easy to get to everything with these
cars<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.930> from<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.230> back
