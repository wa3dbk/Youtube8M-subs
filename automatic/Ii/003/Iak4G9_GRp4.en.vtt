and<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.770> those<00:01:40.890> drinks<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.340> um

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
and you know for those drinks like um

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.740 
and you know for those drinks like um
let's<00:01:42.360> say<00:01:43.040> something<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.189> layered<00:01:44.750> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
let's say something that's layered a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.350 
let's say something that's layered a
tequila<00:01:46.530> sunrise<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> most<00:01:48.149> obvious

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
tequila sunrise that's the most obvious

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
tequila sunrise that's the most obvious
anything<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> grenadine<00:01:50.009> sitting

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
anything that has the grenadine sitting

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
anything that has the grenadine sitting
on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> bottom<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:51.060> raspberry<00:01:51.570> liqueur<00:01:51.720> or

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
on the bottom or raspberry liqueur or

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.300 
on the bottom or raspberry liqueur or
anything<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> be

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
anything like that and you want to be

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
anything like that and you want to be
able<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> show<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.180> gradient<00:01:55.049> miss

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
able to show that that gradient miss

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
able to show that that gradient miss
between<00:01:55.770> them<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.579> glass<00:01:56.850> works<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> lot

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
between them this glass works a lot

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.700 
between them this glass works a lot
better<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
better because you can see it all and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
better because you can see it all and
it's<00:01:59.310> still<00:01:59.549> durable<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.270> doesn't<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.750> as

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it's still durable it doesn't have as

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.230 
it's still durable it doesn't have as
big<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.350> body<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> base<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
big of a body on the base so it's a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
big of a body on the base so it's a
little<00:02:03.420> bit<00:02:03.630> lighter<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.140> still<00:02:04.680> has<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> little

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
little bit lighter it still has a little

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
little bit lighter it still has a little
thickness<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.360> still<00:02:06.600> take<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
thickness here so we can still take the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.010 
thickness here so we can still take the
damage<00:02:07.429> but<00:02:08.429> most<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> consumed<00:02:09.840> with

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
damage but most of it is consumed with

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.479 
damage but most of it is consumed with
just<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> glass<00:02:10.560> itself<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> glass

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
just the glass itself so the glass

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.700 
just the glass itself so the glass
really<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.599> just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
really is just

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.680 
really is just
to<00:02:13.950> make<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:14.460> drink<00:02:14.730> look<00:02:14.880> tall<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.150> fancy

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
to make your drink look tall and fancy

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
to make your drink look tall and fancy
and<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.170> presentation<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> drink<00:02:17.340> itself

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and the presentation of the drink itself

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.600 
and the presentation of the drink itself
is<00:02:17.910> Center<00:02:18.780> focus<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.830> there's<00:02:20.370> something<00:02:20.490> to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
is Center focus so there's something to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
is Center focus so there's something to
think<00:02:20.790> about<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.060> you're<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.750> could

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
think about if you're if you could

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.470 
think about if you're if you could
either<00:02:22.020> do<00:02:22.230> both<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:22.980> both<00:02:23.250> these<00:02:24.090> ones<00:02:24.360> I

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
either do both I have both these ones I

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
either do both I have both these ones I
typically<00:02:24.780> use<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.050> Arnold<00:02:25.560> Palmer's<00:02:25.920> these

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
typically use for Arnold Palmer's these

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.220 
typically use for Arnold Palmer's these
ones<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.730> use<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.090> more<00:02:27.210> fancy<00:02:27.600> drinks<00:02:27.930> or<00:02:28.080> if

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
ones I use for more fancy drinks or if

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.810 
ones I use for more fancy drinks or if
I'm<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:28.920> making<00:02:29.280> an<00:02:29.370> orange<00:02:29.640> juice

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
I'm just you know making an orange juice

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.040 
I'm just you know making an orange juice
or<00:02:30.000> something<00:02:30.270> I'd<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.630> tend<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.960> use

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
or something I'd have to tend to use

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.280 
or something I'd have to tend to use
these<00:02:31.340> soda<00:02:32.340> also<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.300> Coke<00:02:33.510> Zero<00:02:33.540> goes<00:02:33.990> in<00:02:34.140> one

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
these soda also my Coke Zero goes in one

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.380 
these soda also my Coke Zero goes in one
of<00:02:34.380> these<00:02:34.500> because<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.550> roll<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> ice<00:02:36.120> up

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
of these because you roll the ice up

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 
of these because you roll the ice up
there<00:02:36.420> draw<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.440> coke<00:02:37.740> down<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.250> you've<00:02:38.370> got

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
there draw the coke down and you've got

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.330 
there draw the coke down and you've got
12<00:02:38.910> ounces<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.330> coke<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:41.070> almost

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
12 ounces of coke so really almost

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.950 
12 ounces of coke so really almost
almost<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.910> whole<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.270> but<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.540> all<00:02:42.750> because

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
almost the whole can but not all because

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.690 
almost the whole can but not all because
the<00:02:43.140> ice<00:02:43.290> does<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.430> where<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the ice does that thing where it

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.900 
the ice does that thing where it
displaces<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:47.250> friends<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.880> the
