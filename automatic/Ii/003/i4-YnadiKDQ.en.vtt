00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello friends welcomes you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.630
 auto repair kia motors today in this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.799
 video release we would like you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.690
 talk about how to replace 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.690
 fluids in the power steering system 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.760
 first we need to pump out all 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.760
 available fluid in the tank 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.760
 power steering 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.300
 after the fluid is removed to us 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 it is necessary to remove the tank itself for its 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.500
 subsequent cleaning 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.580
 pay attention to the wall of the tank itself 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.610
 there are deposits on it 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.970
 happens when not timely 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:10.250
 replace with cleaning fluid 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.460
 we will need a special tank 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 chemistry 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.620
 cleaning is performed in several stages 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.770
 the zucchini will not be completely cleaned 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.080
 the mileage of this car is 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.080
 70 thousand kilometers 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.159
 Kim motors service specialists 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.670
 recommend replacing fluid 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.229
 in the system by the hydraulic booster every 20,000 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:04.409
 either a divorce 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:08.410
 what comes earlier after washing 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:17.700
 tank we blow it in order to remove 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:21.489
 the remaining chemistry in it is the next stage 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.040
 it's strait to the liquid itself for 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.880
 power steering 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.510
 all systems of this we need a watering can 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.510
 and a container for collecting old liquid 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.660
 fluid is used in this case 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.150
 original honda motor corporation 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.370
 but for this procedure you can also 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.579
 use third party fluids 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.579
 manufacturers 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.489
 to flush the system itself to us 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.349
 it took a half liter of liquid 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.360
 as you have already noticed the liquid which 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:21.260
 is in the system itself at this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:24.830
 the moment is very dirty after washing 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.220
 systems we set the tank back 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.220
 power steering 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.090
 after setting points 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:53.830
 we need to set the required 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:58.030
 level level is set at 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.440
 engine running according to 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.810
 technical regulations 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.090
 fluid level and condition checked 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.549
 every 10 thousand kilometers 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.549
 either semi-annually, whichever comes first 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.340
 after we replaced the fluid 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.190
 set the required level 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.739
 we clean all the elements of good oil 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.419
 which spilled when dismantling the tank 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.419
 either when flushing the system 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.010
 procedure for replacing fluid in the system 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.010
 power steering completed 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:48.400
 out of order, of necessity 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.400
 engine compartment car 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.410
 on this our video review is completed thanks 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.410
