Pikmin<00:00:36.030> 3<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.420> first<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> storyline

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Pikmin 3 the first one is a storyline

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and the second one is going to be the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.340 
and the second one is going to be the
types<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.360> Pikmin<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.050> play<00:00:40.230> with
