00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.640
 the damage that can be caused by a chimney fire can be that standard 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.039
 therefore, metaloterm developed considerably 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.730
 a double-walled flue that isolates the absolute chimney fire 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.070
 is resistant 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 so that they can enjoy a new fire without worry 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.039
 in our controlled test environment 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.820
 a controversial week that arose and the consequences of a chimney fire 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.469
 this fire could have been caused by the fact that football can become one time lower 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.129
 built up 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.500
 due to incomplete combustion 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.170
 causes of this are the use of moist likes 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 or dampen the fire there 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.310
 this tar layer that is formed as a result can never be completely removed 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.620
 in this test set-up we can see the ten through a mirror under the flue 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 lay in the flue for years 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.840
 this tar layer slowly absorbs itself on the inside of the flue 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 evaporation of the volatile substances in the creosote 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 when regularly your chimney last weeks it becomes very low 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 largely removed 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 but even after the World Cup, a layer of creosote remains 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.940
 creosote is created in liquid form by cooling and condensation 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.040
 from the om burns gasses 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.869
 during a heating season 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.869
 together that wet month can go up to 15 liters 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.060
 if the fire looks high in the stove, the water from the tap evaporates 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.960
 closed 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.130
 so the most useful ingredients remain oldest for four consecutive days 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.870
 the flue 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.150
 this time low will continue to ignite 400 to 600 degrees celsius 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.700
 when we open the stove or, for example, keep topping up 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.100
 a dangerous situation arises 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.280
 because of the extra oxygen entry the combustion goes faster and the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.250
 temperature in the flue is too fast 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.149
 now the temperature in the flue rises above 600 degrees 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.129
 given the start of a chimney fire in the mirror that 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.129
 were placed under the flue 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.179
 on the roof it is a chimney fire recognizable by the fierce one 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:22.889
 smoke development 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.650
 at the stove there is a roaring sound in the flue and 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.799
 creates a stronger one 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.030
 the temperature in the flue has now risen to more than 1000 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.129
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.540
 the single-walled connection line is therefore red-hot just like the inside 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.689
 month or the non-personalized gift I also have room 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.509
 thanks to the good isolation of the benefit system, the card is the newspaper 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.489
 on the other hand, only a handler 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.739
 due to the enormous heat in the flue, the parts expanded considerably, causing 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.879
 these can be damaged 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.609
 methanol term acting on channel not damaged 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.010
 because the inner mantle can move freely compared to abroad 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.959
 after the fire, the chimney is just there 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.089
 entrance of cryo cell 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.179
 dior also analyst thus has money again for a new heating season 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.049
 metaloterm mate is the only chimney parties always with 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.949
 can enjoy the peace of mind in the open fire 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.759
 That is why we provide a twenty-year guarantee here 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.149
 even after a chimney fire 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.339
 looked at metaloterm 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.099
 to secure a similar
