probably the robots but easier are
easier<00:03:39.379> than<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.620> slave<00:03:39.799> drivers<00:03:40.189> it's<00:03:40.310> a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
easier than the slave drivers it's a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.619 
easier than the slave drivers it's a
giant<00:03:42.129> butchers<00:03:43.129> better<00:03:44.000> robots<00:03:44.359> like<00:03:44.480> the

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
giant butchers better robots like the

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.879 
giant butchers better robots like the
mix<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.260> guess<00:03:48.409> I<00:03:48.530> can't<00:03:48.709> take<00:03:48.859> a

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
mix it's like I guess I can't take a

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:56.050 
mix it's like I guess I can't take a
power<00:03:49.849> thing<00:03:52.659> but<00:03:53.859> if<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:54.919> need<00:03:55.400> more

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
power thing but if you need more

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.220 
power thing but if you need more
