here Tyler says it's brain donations
from<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.549> Dunnigan<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:03.570> key

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
from people like Dunnigan that are key

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
from people like Dunnigan that are key
to<00:02:03.930> understanding<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.310> far

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to understanding but they so far

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.280 
to understanding but they so far
don't<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.110> way<00:02:07.350> we're<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> learn

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
don't in that way we're going to learn

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.610 
don't in that way we're going to learn
exactly<00:02:09.290> how<00:02:09.770> this<00:02:10.480> damage<00:02:11.480> occurs<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
exactly how this damage occurs and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.280 
exactly how this damage occurs and
whether<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.730> can<00:02:13.880> be<00:02:14.060> prevented<00:02:14.510> whether<00:02:15.170> it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
whether it can be prevented whether it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.320 
whether it can be prevented whether it
can<00:02:15.440> be<00:02:15.560> treated<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.820> we<00:02:17.120> encourage

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
can be treated and so we encourage

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.580 
can be treated and so we encourage
people<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.770> families<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:20.210> come<00:02:20.570> forward<00:02:21.020> when

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
people and families to come forward when

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.710 
people and families to come forward when
there<00:02:21.800> has<00:02:22.040> been<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.520> history<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:23.000> concussion

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
there has been a history of concussion

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.530 
there has been a history of concussion
and<00:02:23.930> especially<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.590> those<00:02:24.830> who<00:02:25.340> are<00:02:25.730> showing

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
and especially in those who are showing

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.980 
and especially in those who are showing
signs<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.680> brain<00:02:27.980> degeneration<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:29.510> actually

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
signs of brain degeneration to actually

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.510 
signs of brain degeneration to actually
will<00:02:30.350> their<00:02:31.100> brains<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.720> our<00:02:33.110> project<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.490> that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
will their brains to our project so that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.790 
will their brains to our project so that
we<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:35.390> make<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.410> correlation

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
we can actually make that correlation

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.940 
we can actually make that correlation
between<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:38.180> symptoms<00:02:38.600> they<00:02:38.840> had<00:02:39.200> during

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
between what symptoms they had during

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.270 
between what symptoms they had during
life<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.520> what<00:02:41.210> are<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.810> effects<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.830> their

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
life and what are the effects on their

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.050 
life and what are the effects on their
brain<00:02:43.610> cells<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:45.920> Dunnigan<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.520> his<00:02:46.640> family

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
brain cells for Dunnigan and his family

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
brain cells for Dunnigan and his family
it's<00:02:47.630> hoped<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:47.990> more<00:02:48.290> athletes<00:02:48.710> will<00:02:48.950> come

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
it's hoped that more athletes will come

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.640 
it's hoped that more athletes will come
forward<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.550> help<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.750> one<00:02:50.960> day<00:02:51.170> others

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
forward to help so that one day others

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.100 
forward to help so that one day others
won't<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.250> face<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:53.030> same<00:02:53.270> lifelong

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
won't have to face the same lifelong

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.170 
won't have to face the same lifelong
battle<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:55.130> takes<00:02:55.400> support<00:02:56.270> -<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.760> help<00:02:59.030> us

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
battle it takes support - to help us

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.370 
battle it takes support - to help us
understand<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:02.090> seriousness<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.990> this<00:03:03.200> in

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
understand the seriousness of this in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.400 
understand the seriousness of this in
our<00:03:03.500> society<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.210> we<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.840> continue<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
our society and so we can continue to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.190 
our society and so we can continue to
deal<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.400> hopefully<00:03:08.200> eliminate

deal with it and and hopefully eliminate

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:28.890 
deal with it and and hopefully eliminate
it<00:03:09.320> one<00:03:09.500> day
