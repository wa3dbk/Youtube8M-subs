00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.040
 about four thousand 600 million years ago on the edge of one of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.149
 the spiral arms of a pretty dark galaxy 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.730
 a lot of surprises 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.379
 presented to turn 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.169
 in a manufacturing line 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.460
 these rocks and gases are the remains of several stars where they exploded 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.509
 long time 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.689
 it is possible that about 100 million years later these space debris 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.949
 who are beginning to be attracted by the force of shocking gravity 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.250
 the production of light energy 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.160
 the planets stand out with each other causing one to be transmitted between 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.280
 others it is very difficult one of these weight plans to each person of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 planet Earth 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.040
 suffers continuous cataclysmic bombing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.310
 and I think that until it becomes a large incandescent molten ball 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.990
 about 100 million years after the earth began to form 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.520
 it produces a change 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.020
 the wool literally the streets of the earth at that time the most 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 light that awaited her to his conclusions 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 begins to cool after knowing this form in a court 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.690
 for the moment the performing arts 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.690
 But this is just the beginning 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.860
 Reported masses of molten rock known as cartons go up to the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 surface stay there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 as a place to the truth of the original crust of the cross 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 Meanwhile 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.719
 the wool of the primordial surface of the planet 1 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.330
 to throw by water 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 in other cases 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.160
 over time the atmosphere of spending so saturated with water vapor 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.170
 one of the tickets for sale for at least one million years 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.460
 well fly over above the earth at that time 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.060
 we came under a sky cared for 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.160
 an immense smile marked only cause fires more affordable 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.069
 and although it seems incredible it is possible that the provincial entity itself 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.129
 Barcelona 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.309
 that idea emerged in the oceans 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.459
 It may have been delayed several times 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.699
 because of the cataclysmic bombings that have slowed 0-1 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.339
 the earth before taking its physical state 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:32.949
 a surprise 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:36.989
 this sector and the size of a michelle basketball as thin as 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.979
 a woman 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.229
 if it were Thursday 14 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:44.419
 an ashen mantle unknown science a law 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.859
 well without anesthesia 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.539
 look at 2006 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:53.529
 a total of 16 of 17 years stated that for six months and in all 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.529
 decision processes 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 the solid criteria and real madrid 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.639
 also the incredible process of the tectonic plates of Asia put in 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.609
 March 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.679
 although they do not know how and when the road should be 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.549
 maybe it should be attached to the center 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.889
 the smart reader 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.889
 it's going to be a trip around 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:28.419
 Maybe this is how Julian at the beginning the tractor drivers and a 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 continent called the uribe are there just that 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.029
 about 500 million years later it will be air 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.829
 in the room 2 500 million barrels in the blood reserves 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.919
 the continents moved to life separately 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.169
 up to 5.8 billion years 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.589
 arctic collided with what usually santa rita rita what is 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.299
 formed min 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.299
 after - the Mexican 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.799
 fernandez iker martínez 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.790
 some 300 million years later the masses separated he was reborn 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 with a new configuration 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.709
 pajín also fractured 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.850
 when I wanted to be Atlantic murphy they separated 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.949
 if all this is confused join the club 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.789
 the same earth seems to be confused 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.499
 these moments 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.740
 2 but the number of copies he 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.999
 possible 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.449
 the western coast of la benemérita was close to chile 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.099
 California 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.120
 clandestine workshops if they were not alive 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.229
 college 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.990
 he was united as the next angel 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.020
 if we could use the machine 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.190
 time that rules the earth and turn it back we'll see around here 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.159
 even if we were witnesses of that portfolio of demolition of continents would follow 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.930
 asking a question without answer 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.339
 who has enough 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.199
 apparently 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.039
 the force that moves the plates 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.819
 Excellent movement of the warm and semi-solid mantle that lies beneath 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:12.900
 rigid plates 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.659
 as if we were going out 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.069
 the oldest 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.389
 the magma at incredible temperatures is going to the surface and that's where it starts 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.430
 to cool down 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.249
 so it shows the bottom of the pot 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.499
 the inta lemon pop and go back up 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.770
 This cycle is repeated again and again 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.520
 to generate what scientists call convective cells by loose 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.849
 with destiny 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.800
 but where it keeps its surroundings from the source 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 that allowed him to do these gymnastic exercises 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.999
 is to protect zelaya 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.999
 these commissions and the gravitational shocks that gave rise to 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.069
 this energy is still trapped 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.580
 and there are other people 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.529
 entities in continuation 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.680
 yes so the world followed 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.889
 the radioactive material 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.240
 in the belly of the beast 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.259
 durán introduce you 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.259
 the heat when disintegrating 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.849
 has significantly reduced the speed at which the earth is simple 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.909
 what does this mean for the surface 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.039
 the 60s 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.919
 the first 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.980
 ex of life through the fissures is pushing the plates 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.980
 and making the respective continents and they go 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.789
 the second because what happens at the other end of the plates in the area of 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:41.779
 collision 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.969
 It can be equally important 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.660
 the plates more things 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.440
 that are introduced below the lightest ones dragged down by the 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.440
 sidewalks return to demand 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.240
 that's what we know 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.619
 or what we want to do 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:03.259
 but perhaps we never know closely the details of what happens in the 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.120
 the deepest places on earth 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.539
 gómez in which the tectonic plate motor is combined
