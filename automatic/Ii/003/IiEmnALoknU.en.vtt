00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:28.189
 hello my name is denis shevchenko and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:32.120
 today we will look at how you can 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.649
 to diversify what ideas to add to 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 rhythmic funk pattern which we 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.390
 analyzed in the previous lesson we start with 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.219
 chord that sounds we already 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.219
 familiarized with the chords active 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.450
 Now let's take a look at the chord not 13 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.780
 and that is for me 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:07.350
 and this is a D flat note 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.090
 accordingly as well as a cat we are 9 we can 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.430
 transform it all along the neck 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.549
 that is, we want to take a chord 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.549
 until 13 we find but there 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.619
 up to 13 now let's see how 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.500
 this thirteenth note can be written into that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:44.789
 rhythmic pattern that we studied 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:55.229
 before that so we have one of the simplest and 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:59.520
 Falco's main drawings now where are we 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:04.579
 add to this 13 that note as 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.579
 example we can add it to 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:32.700
 the last but one third 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 fast paced sounds like you can 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.760
 to diversify 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 this funky drawing we can do 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.530
 slides like on board up 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.770
 so half a tone down 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:17.980
 that is, we combine this rhythmic 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:20.290
 a picture with slides or slide 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 begin to appear because of tact they 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:39.090
 the first part is compatible with 13 degree 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.820
 let's talk about the slide on the board 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:08.430
 or half a ton down 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:13.560
 one of the big points that we hit 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:19.040
 by country at the time when we take 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.970
 chord on the floor and up or on the pluto 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.530
 down at me 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:30.330
 and when we do slide already 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 directly into the chord not 9 beats 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.740
 the mediator does not occur 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:51.280
 another important point is that after the slide 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.620
 chord should not sound 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.700
 exactly as much as required 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.290
 next upside no way 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.290
 don't leave it 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.360
 muffled or not completely sounding and 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:12.880
 you but what are you with do not rush to play 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:18.160
 slowly and surely under the metronome on 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.630
 on mastering these but introductions to you 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.840
 need of course 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.600
 some time and if you liked
