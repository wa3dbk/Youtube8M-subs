00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.970
 activision blizzard has not received anything more

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.550
 I always gave you a game, we're doing 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.500

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.570
 world 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.700
 remembering that the payment is expensive monthly 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.290
 so besides you pay monthly you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.720
 want to buy the game goals 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.550
 I know the money in the game and have 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.730
 national party you do not need 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.890
 nor leave the game to spend money on 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.420
 game screen even without your shoelace 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.160
 credit card and talk to whom 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.170
 I got here to buy it here. 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.490
 does not even enter the bank's website and 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.340
 think twice 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.880
 It's a sensational thing to breeze from. 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.980
 beauty collection of games is for 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.769
 subscription is actually decreasing 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.109
 it is something that has been decreasing 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.290
 people who pay to play because 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.210
 because there are many free games today 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.460
 to make money with micro 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.890
 then it's something I 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.260
 said we were thinking through it because 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.820
 it is a game that charges the registration 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.580
 then the number of 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.560
 players but the part of transactions and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.210
 micro transactions online within the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.110

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.290
 other games 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.900
 so he might be missing out on a space 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.580
 free game or thinking up 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.370

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.560
 more players knowing where else 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.320

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.220

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.419
 usemi oz games that collect more money
