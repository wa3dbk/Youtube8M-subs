 Of the three front runners, the left and the right are meant to move up or down

 browse for months 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.700

 the right one is to mark the round and with the left one can adjust the turning point 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.540
 buy a screen

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.620
 exercises 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 but you also can not imagine I was thinking complete 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.460
 on the basis of the cards it opens with his horse and sport.com as a result 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 to put kings over a card to determine greetings that are then goes 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.220
 discard 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.300
 baarn cutting data under the tab but and in addition there is you about it 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.440
 Over time see the changes in the different values ​​such as 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.620
 highlight poor you can do things that you have burnt 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.650
 distance traveled through it 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.800
 under the my collection tab there are several windows that were driven 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.630
 in addition 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.639
 on a map 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.790
 it is a beret driven and of course choose to own a piece with it 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.519
 text into a summary 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.799
 if you go there from the overview page people who your bike rides goes to 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.590
 see the cultivation you will see a page with 2 6 3 6 the baltic states 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.189
 gets traveled this year and around a star status chart containing one 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.849
 number of data such as your head that the ackermans heart rate 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.449
 its combination is very interesting to look at, for example 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:40.089
 altena the last you sprint what i pulled i get a top speed of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.040
 33 out of three kilometers per hour with a heartbeat of 141 beats per minute 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.169
 it is unfortunately not possible for a driver to follow a route with 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.160
 using a card 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.970
 what you can do is indicate a preferred destination on a PC in advance 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.820
 and if you set this to drive 40 then it will be years using peel and 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.249
 guide the distance meter to your destination 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.639
 the cadence sensor, the heart rate sensor and the speed sensors 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 are only included with version 40 2 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.889
 due to the extensive choice of training programs and the clear 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.799
 analysis substance to work, the driving 40 is well suited for both the novice 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.399
 as the advanced athletes 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.579
 it is also benefits and shockproof and that makes it suitable 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.459
 to train in conditions that are a bit rougher like a pencil 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.459
 to be shy but also to prove 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.129
 runs an extensive 40 put on the market if they are the training coach and that 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.129
 In my opinion it makes a rich selection of dates to use again 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.900
 with a clear display and easy operation 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.909
 you literally and figuratively keep your finger on the pulse while reaching 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.819
 of your personal training purposes 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.159
 you can choose to order the drive 40 without the cadence and 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.939
 atmospheric the heart rate sensors without the speed sensors 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.160
 makes it from the insights that 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.130
 provide the combination of these three if you buy various t that drive 40 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.489
 it is giving added value 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.819
 if yes yes and made disaster to take your bikes to a higher level 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.270
 lifting 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.160
 take a look at fietscomputer sport.nl or b that look good and pots 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.800
 next review
