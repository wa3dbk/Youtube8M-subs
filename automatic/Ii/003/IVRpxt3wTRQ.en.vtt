00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
know but what are the frontage II it was

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.270 
know but what are the frontage II it was
working<00:03:28.910> on<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.299> physics<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.780> working<00:03:30.349> this<00:03:31.069> is

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
working on to physics to working this is

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.629 
working on to physics to working this is
the<00:03:31.760> recording<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.930> see<00:03:33.199> if<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.769> works<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.489> you

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
the recording to see if it works for you

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.839 
the recording to see if it works for you
guys<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.419> sure<00:03:36.139> that<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.440> does<00:03:36.650> work<00:03:36.949> but<00:03:37.669> so

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
guys to I sure that it does work but so

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.759 
guys to I sure that it does work but so
many<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.060> guys<00:03:38.180> don't<00:03:38.599> don't<00:03:39.139> believe<00:03:39.410> me<00:03:39.650> are

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
many you guys don't don't believe me are

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.159 
many you guys don't don't believe me are
just<00:03:39.799> too<00:03:40.310> lazy<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.879> try<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.660> get<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> code

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
just too lazy to try to get a code

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.909 
just too lazy to try to get a code
yourself<00:03:44.019> so<00:03:45.019> I'm<00:03:45.109> doing<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:45.470> for<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.739> guys

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
yourself so I'm doing this for you guys

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.520 
yourself so I'm doing this for you guys
the<00:03:46.400> capture<00:03:46.910> code<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> capture<00:03:48.319> code

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
the capture code this is a capture code

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.809 
the capture code this is a capture code
right<00:03:48.739> here<00:03:50.169> some<00:03:51.169> of<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.410> guys<00:03:51.609> keep<00:03:52.609> saying

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
right here some of you guys keep saying

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.580 
right here some of you guys keep saying
you<00:03:52.970> guys<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.150> wrong<00:03:53.690> capture<00:03:54.079> code<00:03:54.290> or<00:03:54.530> you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
you guys have wrong capture code or you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.250 
you guys have wrong capture code or you
don't<00:03:54.739> know<00:03:54.919> where<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.430> get<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.609> CAPTCHA<00:03:55.879> code

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
don't know where to get a CAPTCHA code

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.189 
don't know where to get a CAPTCHA code
but<00:03:57.260> actually<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.909> capture<00:03:59.269> codes<00:03:59.540> do

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
but actually that the capture codes do

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.339 
but actually that the capture codes do
work<00:04:00.970> there's<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.120> description<00:04:02.480> there'll<00:04:03.199> be<00:04:03.260> a

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
work there's a description there'll be a

work there's a description there'll be a
description<00:04:03.739> below<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:05.199> taking<00:04:06.199> away<00:04:06.319> can

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
description below and taking away can

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.979 
description below and taking away can
get<00:04:06.889> capture<00:04:07.310> codes<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.879> does<00:04:08.389> it<00:04:08.569> start<00:04:08.840> to

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
get capture codes so does it start to

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:09.460 
get capture codes so does it start to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.479 
Shelly
it<00:04:09.829> is<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.840> that's<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.169> one<00:04:12.409> a9<00:04:15.130> these<00:04:16.130> numbers

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
it is so that's the one a9 these numbers

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.680 
it is so that's the one a9 these numbers
these<00:04:16.609> numbers<00:04:16.669> are<00:04:17.090> kind<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.329> tricky<00:04:17.859> 194

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
these numbers are kind of tricky 194

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.300 
these numbers are kind of tricky 194
then<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.840> have<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.169> eight

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
then you have the eight

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:34.080 
then you have the eight
the<00:04:23.200> h1i<00:04:24.200> 48<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:26.139> you<00:04:27.139> have<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.440> use<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:32.139> and

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the h1i 48 so you have to use that and

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:46.120 
the h1i 48 so you have to use that and
go<00:04:35.090> this<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:36.080> back<00:04:39.940> on<00:04:40.940> mine<00:04:42.220> 4<00:04:43.570> 8<00:04:44.570> 8<00:04:44.930> so<00:04:45.860> that's

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
go this go back on mine 4 8 8 so that's

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.750 
go this go back on mine 4 8 8 so that's
hard<00:04:46.990> how<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.050> hard<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:49.010> think<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.580> guys

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
hard how the hard to do I think you guys

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.920 
hard how the hard to do I think you guys
can<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.270> anyways

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
can do it anyways

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.010 
can do it anyways

do this and not tell me that code

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.170 
do this and not tell me that code
doesn't<00:05:04.160> work<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:04.610> works

code<00:05:16.760> here<00:05:16.970> probably<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.750> use<00:05:17.930> this<00:05:18.169> code<00:05:18.500> so

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
code here probably to use this code so

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.400 
code here probably to use this code so
don't<00:05:18.860> try<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:20.360> actually<00:05:20.780> use<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.169> pool

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
don't try to actually use the pool
