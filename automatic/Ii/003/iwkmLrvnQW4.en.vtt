00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
not have it I've been a how I used to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.520

manage<00:00:09.030> without<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.510> barrow<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> old<00:00:10.290> days

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I used to walk up the snake pit which is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.299 
I used to walk up the snake pit which is
a<00:00:12.630> good<00:00:12.840> mile<00:00:13.080> or<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.650> two<00:00:13.830> nights<00:00:14.070> worth

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.980 
a good mile or so with two nights worth
of<00:00:14.400> gear<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.610> me<00:00:14.820> back<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
of gear on me back I just thought a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.720 
of gear on me back I just thought a
barrow<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> Barrett<00:00:16.920> done<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> job<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.400> me

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
barrow as a Barrett done the job for me

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
barrow as a Barrett done the job for me
little<00:00:18.390> did<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:19.560> was

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
little did I know that there was

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.920 
little did I know that there was
something<00:00:19.859> far<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
something far better out there and I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.330 
something far better out there and I
struggled<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.439> Barrett<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> good<00:00:23.130> few

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
struggled at Barrett for a good few

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
struggled at Barrett for a good few
years<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:23.910> make<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> constantly<00:00:24.600> count<00:00:24.720> 1

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
years and we make the constantly count 1

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.080 
years and we make the constantly count 1
I<00:00:24.900> get<00:00:25.109> cut<00:00:25.350> poor<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.430> day<00:00:26.580> male<00:00:26.820> grand

I get cut poor or one day male grand

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.060 
I get cut poor or one day male grand
folk<00:00:27.330> pieces<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.080> i<00:00:28.170> buttoned<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.619> boring<00:00:28.920> one

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
folk pieces and i buttoned up boring one

and<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.250> mates<00:00:29.490> cart<00:00:29.760> porters<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.689> honestly

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and we mates cart porters and I honestly

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.229 
and we mates cart porters and I honestly
could<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.380> believe<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> difference<00:00:31.890> no<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
could not believe the difference no I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
could not believe the difference no I
know<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> sounds<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> sales

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
know it sounds like a bit of a sales

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.229 
know it sounds like a bit of a sales
pitch<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> amount<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
pitch but the amount of people over the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
pitch but the amount of people over the
years<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.719> I've<00:00:36.930> said<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.890> try<00:00:38.100> mine

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
years that I've said that just try mine

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
years that I've said that just try mine
with<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> gear<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:40.260> any

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
with the gear on and see if there's any

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
with the gear on and see if there's any
difference<00:00:40.559> every<00:00:41.430> person<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.879> I've<00:00:42.030> showed

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
difference every person that I've showed

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
difference every person that I've showed
it<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:43.260> ended<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.100> buying

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

it to has ended up going out and buying
themselves<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.989> I've<00:00:46.140> got

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
themselves from so this is one I've got

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440

this is a mark to cart Porter this is
slightly<00:00:48.629> newer<00:00:48.930> models<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.340> wider

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
slightly newer models now got a a wider

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
slightly newer models now got a a wider
wheel<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.750> extra<00:00:52.079> stability<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
wheel on it just for extra stability so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
wheel on it just for extra stability so
yeah<00:00:53.129> I'm<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> show<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.520> how<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> load

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
yeah I'm going to show you how to load

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
yeah I'm going to show you how to load
it<00:00:54.030> properly<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.559> you've<00:00:56.309> got

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
it properly now first of all you've got

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
it properly now first of all you've got
this<00:00:56.489> bag<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.590> know<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> wanna<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this bag here know what you wanna do is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.349 
this bag here know what you wanna do is
you<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> try<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.699> some<00:00:59.850> heavy<00:01:00.000> items

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
you want to try and get some heavy items

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
you want to try and get some heavy items
in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> bottom<00:01:00.809> II<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> racing

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
in the bottom II just think of a racing

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.640 
in the bottom II just think of a racing
car<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:03.120> low<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> ground<00:01:03.690> old<00:01:04.229> weights

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
car really low to the ground old weights

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
car really low to the ground old weights
lives<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> cam<00:01:05.430> around<00:01:05.460> corners

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
lives when the cam around corners

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
lives when the cam around corners
they're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> flip<00:01:06.630> over<00:01:06.810> same

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they're not going to flip over same

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
they're not going to flip over same
principle<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.159> low<00:01:08.610> center<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
principle with this low center of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
principle with this low center of
gravity<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.409> what

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
gravity is what it's all about so what

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
gravity is what it's all about so what
you<00:01:10.680> need<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.790> every<00:01:11.939> items

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you need to do is get your every items

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
you need to do is get your every items
in<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> bag<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.170> I'll<00:01:13.920> normally<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.340> me

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
in this bag so I'll normally put me

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
in this bag so I'll normally put me
water<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.030> obviously<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.689> pretty

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
water in there obviously that's pretty

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.249 
water in there obviously that's pretty
heavy<00:01:17.000> bit<00:01:18.000> bite<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.590> bait<00:01:21.259> now

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
heavy bit bite and a bit more bait now

smallest saying but he's completely
adjustable<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> wide<00:03:02.670> bed<00:03:03.150> chair

that pulls out and the same with that
one<00:03:11.400> there<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.030> make<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.300> even<00:03:12.510> longer

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
one there so you can make it even longer

the other thing I like about this is the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.940
