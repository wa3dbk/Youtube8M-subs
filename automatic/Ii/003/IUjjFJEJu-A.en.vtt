we're<00:00:01.290> continuing<00:00:01.439> our<00:00:01.949> series<00:00:02.010> on<00:00:02.520> chapter

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we're continuing our series on chapter

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.240 
we're continuing our series on chapter
two<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.360> aqueous<00:00:03.480> chemistry<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.920> video

two and aqueous chemistry in this video
we'll<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.490> looking<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> hydrophobic

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
we'll be looking at the hydrophobic

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.049 
we'll be looking at the hydrophobic
effect<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.379> its<00:00:07.560> consequences<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.550> terms<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
effect and its consequences in terms of

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.209 
effect and its consequences in terms of
the<00:00:09.210> formation<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.840> biological<00:00:10.530> compartments

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the formation of biological compartments

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.430 
the formation of biological compartments
what<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.179> find<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.870> interactions

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
what we find is that the interactions

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.650 
what we find is that the interactions
with<00:00:13.620> water<00:00:13.889> aren't<00:00:14.160> always<00:00:14.460> positive<00:00:14.880> that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
with water aren't always positive that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.420 
with water aren't always positive that
is<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> say<00:00:16.199> there<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.529> molecules<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.279> are

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
is to say there are molecules that are

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.330 
is to say there are molecules that are
attracted<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> water<00:00:18.560> hydrophilic<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.710> those

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
attracted to water hydrophilic and those

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.939 
attracted to water hydrophilic and those
that<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.670> repelled<00:00:21.060> by<00:00:21.390> water<00:00:21.740> hydrophobic

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
that are repelled by water hydrophobic

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
that are repelled by water hydrophobic
in<00:00:23.340> other<00:00:23.490> words<00:00:23.730> nonpolar<00:00:24.240> compounds<00:00:24.630> won't

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
in other words nonpolar compounds won't

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
in other words nonpolar compounds won't
dissolve<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> polar<00:00:26.400> solvent<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.210> water

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
dissolve at a polar solvent like water

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779 
dissolve at a polar solvent like water
and<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.140> best<00:00:28.349> example<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> fact

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and the best example we have is the fact

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
and the best example we have is the fact
that<00:00:29.939> oil<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.539> don't<00:00:31.019> mix<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.859> fact<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that oil and water don't mix in fact the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
that oil and water don't mix in fact the
denser<00:00:33.000> water<00:00:33.270> settles<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> bottom<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
denser water settles to the bottom of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.220 
denser water settles to the bottom of
the<00:00:34.920> container<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:36.270> question<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the container the question is what is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
the container the question is what is
driving<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> separation<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
driving this separation from a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.600 
driving this separation from a
thermodynamic<00:00:39.270> point<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> view<00:00:40.500> does<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> have

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
thermodynamic point of view does it have

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.119 
thermodynamic point of view does it have
more<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.300> enthalpy<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:43.260> entropy<00:00:43.770> if

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
more to do with enthalpy or entropy if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.360 
more to do with enthalpy or entropy if
we<00:00:44.879> elevate<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> temperature<00:00:46.050> even

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
we elevate the temperature even

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.319 
we elevate the temperature even
considerably<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.640> still<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> same

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
considerably we still see the same

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
considerably we still see the same
separation<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> must<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> do

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
separation so it must have more to do

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
separation so it must have more to do
with<00:00:50.730> entropy<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> indeed<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> does<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.430> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
with entropy and indeed it does if we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
with entropy and indeed it does if we
consider<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.180> figure<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.780> book<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
consider this figure from your book and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
consider this figure from your book and
could<00:00:55.920> imagine<00:00:56.190> taking<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.820> single<00:00:57.059> line<00:00:57.420> polar

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
could imagine taking a single line polar

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.170 
could imagine taking a single line polar
molecule<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> adding<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> water<00:00:59.550> we

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
molecule and adding that to water we

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
molecule and adding that to water we
find<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> water<00:01:00.960> molecules<00:01:01.620> become<00:01:02.039> very

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
find the water molecules become very

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
find the water molecules become very
constrained<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> layer<00:01:03.629> directly<00:01:03.899> around

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
constrained in the layer directly around

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.850 
constrained in the layer directly around
that<00:01:04.890> nonpolar<00:01:05.460> molecule<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:07.049> represents<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that nonpolar molecule this represents a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.730 
that nonpolar molecule this represents a
decrease<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.729> entropy<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.380> change

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
decrease in entropy that is the change

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.240 
decrease in entropy that is the change
in<00:01:10.950> entropy<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.000> Delta<00:01:12.630> s<00:01:12.840> before<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.799> after

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
in entropy the Delta s before and after

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
in entropy the Delta s before and after
adding<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> nonpolar<00:01:15.330> molecule<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
adding that nonpolar molecule is

now<00:01:18.840> perhaps<00:01:19.229> you're<00:01:19.439> thinking<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> those

now perhaps you're thinking of those

they<00:01:26.219> still<00:01:26.579> had<00:01:26.819> freedom<00:01:27.149> of<00:01:27.450> movement

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
they still had freedom of movement

they still had freedom of movement

let's look at that in a little bit more

let's look at that in a little bit more
detail<00:01:43.109> in<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.039> case<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.969> have<00:01:45.209> a<00:01:45.869> fatty<00:01:46.590> acid

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.419

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
around that nonpolar tail the question

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
around that nonpolar tail the question
is<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.769> happens<00:02:14.220> when<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.610> add<00:02:14.819> several

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
molecules of lipid to the water if you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.850

here<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.819> could<00:02:21.000> imagine<00:02:21.510> each<00:02:21.780> individual

lipid being solvated in that case then

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
lipid being solvated in that case then
we<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.799> great<00:02:26.730> number<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.510> water

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
we have a great number of water

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
we have a great number of water

very large decrease in entropy in

very large decrease in entropy in

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.729 
are actually actually clustered together
in<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:42.150> case<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.660> polar<00:02:42.870> head<00:02:43.019> groups<00:02:43.500> are

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
in this case the polar head groups are

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.860 
in this case the polar head groups are

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
tails in this case you'll notice there

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930 
tails in this case you'll notice there
are<00:02:48.959> fewer<00:02:49.470> water<00:02:49.919> molecules<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.880> are

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
are fewer water molecules that are

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.140 
are fewer water molecules that are
clustered<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> say<00:02:52.829> ordered<00:02:53.370> around

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
clustered that is to say ordered around

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.780 
clustered that is to say ordered around
the<00:02:54.510> cluster<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.590> there's<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.859> much<00:02:56.190> lower

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the cluster so there's a much lower

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.300 
the cluster so there's a much lower
decrease<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.720> entropy<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.590> fact<00:02:58.829> we<00:02:59.099> say

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
decrease in entropy and in fact we say

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.330 
decrease in entropy and in fact we say
there's<00:02:59.549> an<00:02:59.700> increase<00:03:00.299> in<00:03:00.510> entropy<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.049> is

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
there's an increase in entropy that is

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.740 
there's an increase in entropy that is
comparatively<00:03:02.340> speaking<00:03:02.569> there's<00:03:03.569> an

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
comparatively speaking there's an

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289 
comparatively speaking there's an
increase<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.560> entropy<00:03:04.769> when<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.910> lipids

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
increase in entropy when the lipids

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.720 
increase in entropy when the lipids
cluster<00:03:06.780> together<00:03:06.989> as<00:03:07.440> compared<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
cluster together as compared to the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.320 
cluster together as compared to the
individual<00:03:09.329> dispersion

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
individual dispersion

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.990 
individual dispersion
so<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> lipid<00:03:12.650> molecules<00:03:13.160> are<00:03:13.340> becoming<00:03:13.730> more

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
so the lipid molecules are becoming more

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.660 
so the lipid molecules are becoming more
ordered<00:03:14.540> but<00:03:14.690> overall<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.830> water<00:03:16.070> molecules

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
ordered but overall the water molecules

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.370 
ordered but overall the water molecules
have<00:03:16.850> greater<00:03:17.150> freedom<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.780> movement<00:03:18.050> and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
have greater freedom of movement and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.490 
have greater freedom of movement and
therefore<00:03:19.100> entropy<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.030> increasing<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.020> this

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
therefore entropy is increasing and this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.750 
therefore entropy is increasing and this
is<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.650> spontaneous<00:03:22.630> Association<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.430> then<00:03:25.610> we

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
is a spontaneous Association so then we

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.420 
is a spontaneous Association so then we
see<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.450> repulsive<00:03:27.140> force<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.770> water<00:03:28.100> is

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
see that the repulsive force of water is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.550 
see that the repulsive force of water is
equally<00:03:28.970> as<00:03:29.180> important<00:03:29.780> as<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.170> attractive

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
equally as important as the attractive

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.250 
equally as important as the attractive
keep<00:03:31.400> in<00:03:31.550> mind<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.330> hydrophobic

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
keep in mind this is the hydrophobic

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.010 
keep in mind this is the hydrophobic
effect<00:03:33.350> not<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.070> lipid<00:03:34.700> effect<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.510> has<00:03:35.720> more

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
effect not the lipid effect it has more

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.590 
effect not the lipid effect it has more
to<00:03:36.260> do<00:03:36.410> with<00:03:36.590> water<00:03:36.920> driving<00:03:37.670> away<00:03:38.000> nonpolar

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
to do with water driving away nonpolar

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.290 
to do with water driving away nonpolar
substances<00:03:39.020> than<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.160> does<00:03:40.370> nonpolar

substances interacting with each other

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.080 
substances interacting with each other
the<00:03:44.630> question<00:03:45.080> then<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.470> how<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.070> these<00:03:46.520> lipid

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the question then is how do these lipid

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
the question then is how do these lipid
molecules<00:03:47.990> associate<00:03:48.710> in<00:03:48.950> water<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.580> it

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
molecules associate in water and it

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.940 
molecules associate in water and it
depends<00:03:50.390> on<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.570> geometry<00:03:50.990> of<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.620> lipid

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
depends on the geometry of the lipid

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.010 
depends on the geometry of the lipid
let's<00:03:52.490> look<00:03:52.640> at<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.880> simple<00:03:53.240> case<00:03:53.480> of<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.780> fatty

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
let's look at the simple case of a fatty

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.140 
let's look at the simple case of a fatty
acid<00:03:54.170> like<00:03:54.620> palmitate<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.610> have<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.820> polar

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
acid like palmitate you have a polar

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.620 
acid like palmitate you have a polar

head group and a single nonpolar tail if

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.120 
head group and a single nonpolar tail if
you<00:03:59.720> look<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.140> bottom<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.710> screen<00:04:00.920> at

pH<00:06:04.220> scale<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.030> acid-base<00:06:05.450> properties<00:06:05.840> of

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
pH scale and the acid-base properties of

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.070 
pH scale and the acid-base properties of
water<00:06:06.590> itself<00:06:07.100> as<00:06:07.400> well<00:06:08.090> as<00:06:08.150> how<00:06:08.480> that<00:06:08.540> relates

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
water itself as well as how that relates

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.870 
water itself as well as how that relates
to<00:06:09.200> other<00:06:09.410> biological<00:06:10.220> molecules<00:06:10.700> and

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
to other biological molecules and

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.300 
to other biological molecules and
systems
