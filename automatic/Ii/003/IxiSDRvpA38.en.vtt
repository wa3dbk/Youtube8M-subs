00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 I originally came from a family 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.920
 very modest 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.140
 I can not say I had a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.929
 childhood atrocious a very childhood 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.240
 hard very hard very striking because 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 This I think is already dramatized a lot 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.890
 and creating the false idea of something that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.980
 It was not but I can tell that I had 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.170
 childhood with many deprivations as it is 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.939
 The case of many people I believe is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.430
 are watching this video now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 I always make fun of this, including 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.990
 When we get together, we'll meet in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 family brother we love to do 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 joke that because actually the best laugh 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 I cry but I did not have everything that I 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 I wanted and until today I do not have everything that I 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 I would like to have and this does not make me a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.469
 unhappy person frustrated because they 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 there is absolutely nothing wrong with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.510
 want to have things and do not have these 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.629
 The things that I would like to have is a house. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 A spacious car of the year is a closet 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.030
 full of fashionable clothes the bathrooms of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.520
 brand nor can cruises travel 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 anyway, who would not like to have all 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 these things but if everyone who is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.380
 This is even more so because only 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.260
 a limited proportion of the population have 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.750
 access or fulfillment of those wishes 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.570
 why in the world as it is we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.869
 We know it today and we 've always been like 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 we are not born under equal conditions and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 equal opportunities in a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.700
 Child who was born today in Senegal 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 a child born today or Swiss and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 in 20 years with 4g around these 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 two children born on the same day 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 in the same world and you compare what 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 each of them performed in achieved 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.439
 it may even be that to escape the rule and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.689
 to counter these statistics 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 two children will win in life 5 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.770
 same but nobody's going to be crazy about 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 disagree that for children and legalizes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.820
 trajectory was much more painful 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.219
 more difficult with many more barriers 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.229
 than for the Swiss child 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.009
 that traveled the same distance 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 ie it is possible to achieve is but can 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.689
 be for some people to be a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.620
 little harder than other 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.500
 even on this foot 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.660
 inequality is that we are born there 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.490
 it is not possible to achieve things because 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.730
 there are means for this you can 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.950
 work hard you can get that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.110
 goal you can diligently 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 including stealing and overtaking 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 of others that many people do 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 blatantly only associated with each 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.310
 thing you want to have 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.770
 there is a price to buy and the price 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.840
 for keeping this thing these two prices 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.150
 to acquire the things that the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.190
 people who are sometimes so 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.440
 it becomes difficult for people to become 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 enjoy the benefits that these things 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.980
 It gave us guys, I'm going to give 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.230
 classic example many people when 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.440
 receive a salary increase they do not 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 hope not even months will come to compromise 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.900
 that surplus is with the acquisition of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.660
 a new asset or with the formation of a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.030
 to achieve that ideal. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 that dream of having a better income be 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.110
 recognized for his work but in 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.050
 she does not live a reality. 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.360
 someone who earns a good income because 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 we won in June earning a thousand or ten thousand 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.500
 that person's money will never go 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 the standard of living of her 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.860
 will never change 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.050
 then no standard of living is not the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.989
 amount of money you earn 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.239
 but it's a kind of life that you take with 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.320
 the things you have is your relationship 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.870
 as a person with the things you have and 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.970
 to the quality of life that those things 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.550
 that they provide and how you become a 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.680
 human being is happier and more accomplished 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.480
 relate to the things you have to 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.070
 enjoy the benefits that they have 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.050
 these things that provide then 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.940
 so they do not necessarily have a ferrari 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 I buy a triplet in the noblest area 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.080
 city ​​does not necessarily have these 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.660
 things will change your standard of living 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.910
 does not always make it richer 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.739
 most of the time buy at the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.070
 poorer people are our money 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.019
 although in abusive interest né inflation 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.030
 because we pay more for everything in 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.489
 Since there is no return, we are 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.590
 working to fund a pattern of 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.720
 life our government wants people to 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.360
 Believe me, we got it because the 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.400
 our purchasing power increased but in 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.650
 true at the end 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.380
 we know that it does not have what it has increased 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.360
 was the credit offer but at the end of the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.250
 even money does not have any left so you have 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.770
 to be smart and vigilant to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.130
 analyze the standard of living you want 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.020
 Tue 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 I personally prefer to have a life. 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.050
 modest a life without great cost knows 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.630
 of what has a regal life plus one 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.220
 masked life behind debt 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.410
 We take my intention with this 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.210
 video is to pose a challenge to the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.919
 respect of what we currently have 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.259
 considered especially from Brazil. 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.210
 which we have considered to be a good 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.970
 standard of living because while people 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.889
 see in this illusion that the goal the standard of 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.080
 that standard of living ruled by the 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.490
 the act of buying from contracting debt 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.440
 People will continue to work if they 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.820
 striving for the wrong reasons 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.760
 I do not want you to think that 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.710
 my intention with this video is 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.599
 demonize and condemn money wealth 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.849
 people who want to have things in 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.590
 life because absolutely none of that is 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.120
 buy is very good has things is 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.520
 very good would be a hypocrisy of my 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.530
 part is that not who does not want to have the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.419
 things and accomplish those desires 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.889
 that dream of consumption for what is the 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.320
 my intention is to plant this 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.470
 questioning and if this standard of living 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.870
 everybody struggles and only works in 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.300
 sun by the sun to have these living standards 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.310
 not compatible with lifestyle 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900
 I want to take this I do not want 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.380
 this old age pattern I do not want to live 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.659
 under the assumptions of this standard of living 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.880
 I want a more modest life, I still 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.520
 I have to work to conquer the 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.470
 status that has nothing to do with 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.020
 my personality no life type 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.150
 that I want to take, do not take as a base 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.550
 the standard of living that others or the 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.979
 government or that, in the end, 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.840
 social end up imposing as the 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.490
 someone's living standard of success 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.810
 success because I think we have 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.639
 to run after resources 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.620
 necessary for us to have a 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.659
 that we want to have the kind of life that 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.280
 we want to take our day-to-day 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.720
 time we wake up until the time that the 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.250
 people sleep what kind of life I 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.229
 I want to have not only for myself but for my 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.849
 my children, what kind of 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.720
 The life I want to have is because 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.070
 we already like 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.990
 this is really we continue 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.420
 working with the wrong reasons to 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.760
 find a pattern of life that only generates 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.500
 I gave a headache because if not 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.290
 rather than using the lifetime of the 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.850
 people have to live the life we ​​use 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.560
 the time of life that we have to 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.260
 to pursue a standard of living for us 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.630
 never lived agents or average and runs 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.860
 behind that week is the horizon 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.960
 that the more you think I 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.750
 coming close but it backs off good 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.300
 this message today I wanted to talk 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.760
 about this and, finally, I hope 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.500
 contributed in some way and told me 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.540
 in the comments what do you think 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.180
 respect of this standard of living has been 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.890
 especially in brazil and the 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.810
 people will exchange this figurine until 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.260
 Next video, God willing 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.260
