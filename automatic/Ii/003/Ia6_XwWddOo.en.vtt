my<00:02:52.709> minigun<00:02:53.130> probably<00:02:53.700> could<00:02:53.970> still<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.570> in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
my minigun probably could still be in

my minigun probably could still be in
rocket<00:02:55.260> launcher<00:02:55.940> gonna<00:02:56.940> flash<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.690> get

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
rocket launcher gonna flash in there get

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.540 
rocket launcher gonna flash in there get
the<00:02:58.020> kill<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.500> fizz<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.190> Italy<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the kill on to fizz and when Italy it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.710 
the kill on to fizz and when Italy it
looks<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.790> she<00:02:59.910> healed<00:03:00.180> herself<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.570> thought

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
looks like she healed herself I thought

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.729 
looks like she healed herself I thought
that<00:03:00.810> would<00:03:00.959> end<00:03:01.050> elite<00:03:01.230> actually<00:03:01.530> pick<00:03:01.650> up

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that would end elite actually pick up

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.040 
that would end elite actually pick up
the<00:03:01.860> kill<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> did<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.570> there<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.020> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
the kill but it did not and there is the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.229 
the kill but it did not and there is the
quad<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.190> had<00:03:05.370> my<00:03:05.550> flash<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.970> would<00:03:06.090> go<00:03:06.209> over

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
quad if I had my flash I would go over

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.080 
quad if I had my flash I would go over
the<00:03:06.570> wall<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:08.430> last<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.030> i

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
the wall there but I at last I do not i

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.430 
the wall there but I at last I do not i
missed<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.600> W<00:03:09.900> probably<00:03:10.200> should<00:03:10.320> have<00:03:10.380> just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
missed the W probably should have just

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.500 
missed the W probably should have just
kept<00:03:10.709> running<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.790> there<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.180> looks<00:03:15.330> like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
kept running but there it looks like

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
kept running but there it looks like
Lucien<00:03:15.840> swift<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.590> W<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.190> throw<00:03:17.430> down<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
Lucien swift on my W but throw down a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.070 
Lucien swift on my W but throw down a
nice<00:03:17.940> set<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> trap<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:18.600> cannot<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:18.989> away

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
nice set of trap so we cannot get away

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.370 
nice set of trap so we cannot get away
looks<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.950> Lucien<00:03:20.250> wants<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.760> duel<00:03:21.540> that's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
looks like Lucien wants to duel that's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.870 
looks like Lucien wants to duel that's
not<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.769> go<00:03:22.890> very<00:03:22.920> well<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:23.280> am<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
not going to go very well for am so a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.150 
not going to go very well for am so a
pretty<00:03:24.299> cool<00:03:24.600> stuff<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.350> actually<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.890> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
pretty cool stuff I I actually think I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.710 
pretty cool stuff I I actually think I
could<00:03:26.340> have<00:03:26.430> done<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.580> better<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.150> so

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
could have done this better so so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
could have done this better so so
mistake<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> guess<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> first<00:03:29.220> thing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
mistake so so I guess the first thing

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.220 
mistake so so I guess the first thing
that<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.670> did<00:03:29.730> was<00:03:29.880> position<00:03:30.360> myself<00:03:30.480> very<00:03:30.840> very

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
that I did was position myself very very

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
well I'm way in the back of this

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.590 
well I'm way in the back of this

flash<00:04:05.690> if<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.780> was<00:04:06.930> rocket<00:04:07.230> launcher<00:04:07.470> they

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
flash if I was rocket launcher they

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.539 
flash if I was rocket launcher they
probably<00:04:07.769> would<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.010> gotten<00:04:08.160> them<00:04:08.370> both

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
probably would have gotten them both

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.910 
probably would have gotten them both
with<00:04:08.820> one<00:04:09.090> auto<00:04:09.329> attack<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.019> then<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.769> will

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
with one auto attack and then we will

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.670 
with one auto attack and then we will
look<00:04:11.070> for<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:12.480> overall<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.170> was<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
look for so overall that was just a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.009 
look for so overall that was just a
really<00:04:14.100> really<00:04:14.549> good<00:04:14.820> position<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.480> be<00:04:15.660> an<00:04:15.870> ad

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
