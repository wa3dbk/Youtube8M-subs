00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 very funny that we are in minecraft 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.830
 1.7 point 10 let's see a mod 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.900
 that is July 7 and is that wii complete 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 this is a way to make cold and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.660
 running from that weird title we have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 several things the most important thing I think that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 It is this that the gloves would say 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 is the most important of all with three of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 leather iron and one vision is that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 when we have them in our hands if we do 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.080
 we maintain control let's do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.380
 freud running like that in a weird way 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.090
 but it's pretty cool that is us 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.470
 allows this allows us to scale and everything 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 Now I'm looking for you to see a 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.900
 little movement describes a mini 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.900
 hop 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.170
 is very cool for example if we give 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.170
 here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.489
 and if when we are add that we click 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.489
 the space the half turn 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.830
 it's pretty cool we have it more 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.040
 little things for example is the has not 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.610
 texture is a shame it is wood without 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.000
 refine 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 and this is pretty cool so 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 example let's go putting it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.230
 So the typical railings where you can 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.400
 to go 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.290
 in fact you are getting closer to the camera 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.330
 he knew how to win because you do not go you're not going to nacha 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.980
 2 but you're going as slow as if 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.690
 you were spent so you can 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.590
 walking on the bar is quite 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.360
 cool 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.330
 I do not know if I put it here if you fall 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.500
 it's pretty cool, cool a lot for 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.000
 it to do parkour so weird is that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.380
 I do not understand much about it is 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.890
 pretty cool this happens to the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 texture if it were texture would already be 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.150
 Great, we have these here, which is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.370
 the good in which stoner that this weird 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.890
 which is one of wood without reference there is a 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.540
 wooden stick for two and stone 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 It is a good stone and a covers 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.070
 they are standing stone and it is quite 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.720
 cool because it allows us to grab them 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.100
 edges I have out there prepared that now 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.070
 we will see and that there 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.009
 the point is that you maintain control and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.810
 you grab and today is pushing sometimes 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.910
 he becomes a little crazy with the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 corners 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.420
 now he is jumping 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.870
 automatically 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.239
 sometimes like that it fails is a bit weird 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 but good of the region we are here 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.170
 as you see I have said here a super wall 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.940
 all these text edged cited the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.900
 edges are always put on the part of 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.970
 above 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.970
 as you see and having the glove boost 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.840
 this is going up that's if we press 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.470
 space up up and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.879
 not now 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.860
 up and now we go backwards I 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.620
 like it is not a little bit the river of the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.840
 truth let's try it come he 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.870
 that you can not 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.629
 no they will not see me like that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.720
 He cited as if we were holding on to that 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.989
 it's pretty cool, that is, we get to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.819
 make a raise like that is a little bit not me 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.019
 it would be nice if it had another kind of function 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.510
 for example when you get to the last 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.180
 bar that could go up strip and that does not 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 can in its potato point because we continue 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 here for example space and here you see 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.220
 hit another little jump up that touched 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.110
 they are through matching the account 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.440
 but another little jump up would be 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.440
 cool 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 from here you were here to the edge 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.430
 it just is not like I would 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.790
 That's more things we can do for 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.579
 example to win us to the roof 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.579
 not only run 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:48.200
 let's go through the roof has no animation is 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.209
 say we go attached with the head 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.800
 but it is quite crossbow to grab 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.170
 ceiling also keeping control 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.100
 always in fact if we stop 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.900
 keep it like it stays a while 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.580
 I'm not supposed to have tried 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.380
 it's a challenge always 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.630
 it seems that always on the boards as 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.940
 that you fall then I do not know because that's how it was and 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.400
 so low is enough wire then 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.460
 the hi hi stack this weird I can put it 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.110
 or something like that 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.170
 it is supposed to be to make leaps of faith 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.540
 I hope he does not kill me 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.100
 in fact as you see when entering inside you 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.480
 slows down 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.480
 let's put it double that did not give me 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.570
 I'm the assassin's shit let 's go 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.199
 and up up up 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.610
 transportation cited low that's not to tell 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.150
 that is creative 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.150
 ok now yes 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.030
 and do not kill you are like the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.780
 cobweb really not only that has 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.160
 this aspect and it does not slow you down 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.300
 it's pretty cool but hey this is 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.610
 everything we have as you see a bot 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.670
 he covered seven is from the free running 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.670
 weird is pretty white I do not 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:12.430
 jump jump jump jump something recite 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.810
 it's very cool I can grab here by 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.900
 curiosity while something I can 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.900
 grab 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.650
 if not 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.539
 but well the description is 1.7 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.839
 point 10 if it is the force will have 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.839
 as usual 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.909
 bye
