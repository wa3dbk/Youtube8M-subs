a<00:00:30.640> very<00:00:30.910> good<00:00:31.059> opportunity<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:31.720> could

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
a very good opportunity that I could

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.240 
a very good opportunity that I could
make<00:00:32.050> use<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.290> during<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> year<00:00:33.010> and

Institute neurology is in the heart of
central<00:00:37.480> London<00:00:37.570> which<00:00:37.930> was<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.110> big<00:00:38.320> factor

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
central London which was a big factor

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.510 
central London which was a big factor
for<00:00:38.710> me

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 

for<00:00:45.150> me<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> most<00:00:45.510> interesting<00:00:45.750> part<00:00:46.290> of<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
for me the most interesting part of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.260 
for me the most interesting part of the
course<00:00:46.650> was<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> research<00:00:47.370> project<00:00:47.940> which

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
course was the research project which

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
course was the research project which
allowed<00:00:49.200> me<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.500> work<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.010> hospital<00:00:50.220> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
allowed me to work in the hospital and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.300 
allowed me to work in the hospital and
to<00:00:51.090> gain<00:00:51.270> access<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.750> patients<00:00:52.560> to<00:00:53.130> meet

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
to gain access to patients to meet

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.160 
to gain access to patients to meet
clinical<00:00:53.730> psychologists<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.750> people<00:00:55.080> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
clinical psychologists and people that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
clinical psychologists and people that
were<00:00:55.290> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> area<00:00:55.740> of<00:00:55.830> my<00:00:56.250> interest<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
were in the area of my interest and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
were in the area of my interest and
while<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.840> very<00:00:58.020> challenging<00:00:58.200> at<00:00:58.530> times<00:00:58.560> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
while it was very challenging at times I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.200 
while it was very challenging at times I
do<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> work<00:00:59.610> myself

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
do a lot of work myself

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.370 
do a lot of work myself
I<00:01:00.330> also<00:01:00.480> found<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.200> rewarding

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.060 

I<00:01:07.469> think<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> most<00:01:08.369> challenging<00:01:08.820> part<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.090> me

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
I think the most challenging part for me

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.670 
I think the most challenging part for me
from<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.370> psychology<00:01:10.880> background<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.690> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
from a psychology background and the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.950 
from a psychology background and the
course<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.159> quite<00:01:13.400> scientific<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.600> at<00:01:14.870> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
course is quite scientific and at the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.240 
course is quite scientific and at the
beginning<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.409> year<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.740> Saturn

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
beginning of the year the Saturn

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.800 
beginning of the year the Saturn
molecular<00:01:16.640> neuroscience<00:01:16.909> was<00:01:17.450> quite

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
molecular neuroscience was quite

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.620 
molecular neuroscience was quite
difficult<00:01:18.440> but<00:01:18.950> as<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.220> year<00:01:19.400> went<00:01:19.580> on<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:20.090> was

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
difficult but as the year went on I was

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.330 
difficult but as the year went on I was
able<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.990> choose<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.620> areas<00:01:22.010> that<00:01:22.040> were<00:01:22.250> of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
able to choose the areas that were of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.070 
able to choose the areas that were of
interest<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.940> me<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.540> accommodate<00:01:23.930> my

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080

needs and with some self-directed

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.280 
needs and with some self-directed
learning<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.330> was<00:01:26.390> able<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.690> overcome<00:01:26.990> these

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
learning I was able to overcome these

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
learning I was able to overcome these
problems<00:01:27.580> difficulties
