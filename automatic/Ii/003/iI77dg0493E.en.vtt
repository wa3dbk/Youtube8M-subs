00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.090 

now<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.900> good<00:00:37.080> example<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.770> an<00:00:37.890> area

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
now this is a good example of an area

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.480 
now this is a good example of an area
that's<00:00:38.520> being<00:00:38.760> actively<00:00:39.060> mine<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:40.560> area<00:00:40.980> here

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
that's being actively mine an area here

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.360 
that's being actively mine an area here
that's<00:00:42.240> been<00:00:42.540> mined<00:00:42.870> already<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.650> as<00:00:43.740> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's been mined already and as the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
that's been mined already and as the
tailings<00:00:44.880> being<00:00:45.150> put<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.290> then

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
tailings being put on top of it and then

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.400 
tailings being put on top of it and then
this<00:00:47.010> area<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.810> same<00:00:48.810> thing<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.230> been

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this area down here same thing it's been

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
this area down here same thing it's been
mined<00:00:49.910> tailings<00:00:50.910> put<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> top<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.630> it<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.900> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
mined tailings put on top of it and the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.860 
mined tailings put on top of it and the
revegetation<00:00:52.710> process<00:00:53.310> started<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.360> people

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
revegetation process started so people

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
revegetation process started so people
kind<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> sit<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.560> lunch<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.370> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
kind of sit and have lunch down there so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
kind of sit and have lunch down there so
it<00:00:57.090> isn't<00:00:57.390> revegetating<00:00:58.200> as<00:00:58.320> fast<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.860> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it isn't revegetating as fast as it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.350 
it isn't revegetating as fast as it
normally<00:00:59.190> would<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.880> wasn't<00:01:00.150> being

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
normally would if it wasn't being

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960 
normally would if it wasn't being
touched<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.710> early<00:01:02.400> signs<00:01:02.700> of

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
touched but you can see early signs of
