to<00:00:17.340> keep<00:00:17.369> mobs<00:00:17.970> out<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.420> your<00:00:18.600> base<00:00:18.810> without

using doors and levers and buttons and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859 
using doors and levers and buttons and
all<00:00:23.010> those<00:00:23.250> sorts<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> things<00:00:24.090> you've

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
all those sorts of things you've

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.500 
all those sorts of things you've
probably<00:00:24.900> seen<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:25.890> ideas<00:00:26.460> before<00:00:26.939> but

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
probably seen these ideas before but

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.009 
probably seen these ideas before but
I'll<00:00:27.660> run<00:00:27.900> over<00:00:27.930> them<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.830> quickly<00:00:30.019> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
I'll run over them really quickly the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.310 
I'll run over them really quickly the
lowest<00:00:31.500> security<00:00:32.489> model<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
lowest security model is this one a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.299 
lowest security model is this one a
simple<00:00:35.100> opening<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.920> rails<00:00:37.920> across

the front of the opening mobs will not

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.850 
the front of the opening mobs will not

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
pass fine through and get to you or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
whatever you've got inside now I should

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970 
whatever you've got inside now I should
point<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.760> won't<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.379> there

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
point out that this won't work if there

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.790 
point out that this won't work if there
is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> whole<00:00:53.430> bunch<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.180> mobs<00:00:54.530> stacked<00:00:55.530> up

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
is a whole bunch of mobs stacked up

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
is a whole bunch of mobs stacked up
there<00:00:56.100> trying<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.270> what

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
there trying to get in because what

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
there trying to get in because what
happens<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> they'll<00:00:58.260> bump<00:00:58.590> each<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
happens is they'll bump each other and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.119 
happens is they'll bump each other and
if<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.059> bumps<00:01:00.480> across<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> rails<00:01:01.379> then

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
if one bumps across the rails then

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
if one bumps across the rails then
they'll<00:01:02.640> pull<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.840> good<00:01:04.140> simple

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
they'll pull in but it's a good simple

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.880 
they'll pull in but it's a good simple
low<00:01:05.760> security<00:01:06.659> model<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.740> on

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
low security model that you can put on

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
low security model that you can put on
the<00:01:08.040> outer<00:01:08.250> perimeter<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.450> keep<00:01:09.720> those<00:01:09.930> mobs

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the outer perimeter to keep those mobs

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.000 
the outer perimeter to keep those mobs
outside<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> next<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.080> slightly<00:01:13.560> better

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
outside the next one is slightly better

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.920 
outside the next one is slightly better
security<00:01:15.650> it<00:01:16.650> defeats<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.520> mobs<00:01:17.930> pathfinding

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
security it defeats the mobs pathfinding

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.890 
security it defeats the mobs pathfinding
much<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:21.650> as<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.689> they

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
much better as you can see here they

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
much better as you can see here they
just<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.860> across<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.299> a

just will not go across it this one is a

just will not go across it this one is a
little<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.780> trickier<00:01:31.200> those<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.920> pieces<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
little bit trickier those are pieces of

little bit trickier those are pieces of

the<00:01:51.280> mobs<00:01:51.580> basically<00:01:52.210> think<00:01:52.510> it's<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.780> hole

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the mobs basically think it's a hole

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.170 
the mobs basically think it's a hole
that<00:01:53.230> they<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.620> fall<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.190> they<00:01:54.760> will<00:01:54.940> not

fantastic

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.359 
fantastic
this<00:02:00.700> will<00:02:00.910> keep<00:02:01.150> mobs<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:02.110> other<00:02:02.890> players

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
this will keep mobs and other players

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.200 
this will keep mobs and other players
out<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.760> your<00:02:04.000> base<00:02:04.210> as<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:05.560> can<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
out of your base as you can see it

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.230 
out of your base as you can see it
involves<00:02:07.840> putting<00:02:08.080> some<00:02:08.860> soul<00:02:09.250> sand<00:02:09.759> across

the front to block high entrance but it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.400 
the front to block high entrance but it
must<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.670> two<00:02:15.940> blocks<00:02:16.239> over<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.989> entrance

must have two blocks over the entrance

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.390 
must have two blocks over the entrance
if<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:18.310> try<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.850> through<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.680> can't<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
if you try going through you can't you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.050 
if you try going through you can't you
simply<00:02:21.880> cannot<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.570> through<00:02:22.810> there<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
simply cannot get through there and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340 
simply cannot get through there and
neither<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.390> mops<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.870> go

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
neither can mops there you go

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.660 
neither can mops there you go
and<00:02:29.440> neither<00:02:30.280> can<00:02:30.520> players<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:32.280> how<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.340> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and neither can players so how do you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.960 
and neither can players so how do you
get<00:02:33.850> through<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.270> opening<00:02:34.900> well<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.580> jump

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
get through this opening well you jump

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
get through this opening well you jump
before<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> get<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.110> soul<00:02:38.350> sand<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
before you get to the soul sand and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040 
before you get to the soul sand and
through<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.660> go<00:02:40.780> through

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
through you go and you can go through

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.290 
through you go and you can go through
this<00:02:41.170> way<00:02:41.410> quite<00:02:41.770> easily<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.430> should<00:02:43.060> probably

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
this way quite easily I should probably
