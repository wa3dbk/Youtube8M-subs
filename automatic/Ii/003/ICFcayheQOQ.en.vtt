there's the door

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.479 
there's the door
now<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:30.890> can<00:00:32.690> do<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> salad<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.070> in

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
now and I can do make the salad in in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.639 
now and I can do make the salad in in
the<00:00:35.610> fridge<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.260> would<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> very

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the fridge but that that would be very

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.549 
the fridge but that that would be very
messy<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.239> efficient<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
messy and it's not very efficient so the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549 
messy and it's not very efficient so the
best<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> salad<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.559> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
best way to do is to make a salad is to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
best way to do is to make a salad is to
get<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> stuff<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> fridge<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> use

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
get the stuff out of the fridge and use

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.959 
get the stuff out of the fridge and use
some<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> workspace<00:00:48.170> let's<00:00:49.170> say<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> table

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
some kind of workspace let's say a table

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.750 
some kind of workspace let's say a table
where<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.120> mix<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.350> combined<00:00:53.039> ingredient

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
where I can mix and combined ingredient

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
where I can mix and combined ingredient
into<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.899> great<00:00:55.140> salad<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.570> thing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
into some great salad and the same thing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
into some great salad and the same thing
is<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.140> computer<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.879> fridge

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is with your computer and that fridge

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.220 
is with your computer and that fridge
would<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.660> hard-disk

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
would be your hard-disk

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.439 
would be your hard-disk
that's<00:01:02.010> where<00:01:02.250> everything<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.730> stored<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that's where everything is stored you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
that's where everything is stored you
programs<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.439> documents<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.040> deputy<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
programs your documents in deputy and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.200 
programs your documents in deputy and
that<00:01:06.150> workspace<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.110> RAM<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that workspace is your RAM so when I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
that workspace is your RAM so when I
want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.630> my<00:01:12.780> salad<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> need<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> need

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
want to make my salad what I need I need

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.760 
want to make my salad what I need I need
to<00:01:14.220> load<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> ingredients<00:01:15.150> from<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> fridge

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
to load the ingredients from the fridge

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
to load the ingredients from the fridge
onto<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.979> workspace<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> same

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
onto that workspace and that's the same

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.210 
onto that workspace and that's the same
thing<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> load<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
thing what you do when you load a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
thing what you do when you load a
program<00:01:20.490> where<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.000> open<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.450> document<00:01:22.220> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
program where you open up a document you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.580 
program where you open up a document you
double<00:01:23.549> click<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> something<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.590> what

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
double click on something and what

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
double click on something and what
happens<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> something<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> program

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
happens is that something that program

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
happens is that something that program
or<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> document<00:01:28.740> gets<00:01:29.310> loaded<00:01:29.610> into<00:01:29.909> Ram<00:01:31.400> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
or that document gets loaded into Ram so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
or that document gets loaded into Ram so
and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.400> work<00:01:35.869> isn't

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and then you work and all you work isn't

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.340 
and then you work and all you work isn't
that<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.130> workspace<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.420> RAM<00:01:39.720> same

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that in that workspace in that RAM same

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
that in that workspace in that RAM same
thing<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.680> myself<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.520> mixing<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.270> salad

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
thing with myself I'm mixing my salad

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.080 
thing with myself I'm mixing my salad
here<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.430> mixing<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
here and you know mixing all the

they run or you can run really big

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.590 
they run or you can run really big
programs<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:11.580> big<00:02:12.580> engineering<00:02:13.090> programs

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
