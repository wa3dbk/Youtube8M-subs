 the description of the video for 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 rectify identified this page that 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.070
 is mega be here simply when 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.380
 gave the you have to give in to 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.780
 but it ended without downloading it here in 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.210
 or download that 'I do not have but once 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 that they have downloaded it they go to where 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 they sent it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.739
 I get married by taking the desk what 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.800
 we will have to do is give it and button 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 right we put you extract which the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 will exceed they will leave 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.120
 folders with the program i 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.990
 but the pachuca as the king is called 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.610
 the crack that is forgetting little to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 little once they have been left 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.250
 do is open what I'm going to believe windows 5 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.480
 we're going to have to open the installer 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.570
 until the moment that is at the moment 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.490
 to go to the last step 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.920
 you have to try to know how to unmark new 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.729
 option that says we want to know the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.350
 program since that yes it opens it no longer goes 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.450
 to work 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.450
 and although do and here too 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.670
 it's maybe a divorced portion I have 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.080
 money to bring stay forever 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.880
 following 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.880
 where does he say yes 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.740
 in opening the program here else is going to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.440
 appear the option for once marking 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.520
 nothing in terms that do not open 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.810
 good once we have already installed 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.549
 but let's make it start up 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.299
 good of options and we're going to go to the one 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:41.920
 says windows efe xb type point 1 that 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.920
 do is six licenses in patches 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.740

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.530
 return this little window when we open 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.230
