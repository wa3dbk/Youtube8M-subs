00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
you take a look at mine it looks decent

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.900 
you take a look at mine it looks decent
all<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:31.700> lean<00:02:32.690> taper<00:02:33.470> there's<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.340> much

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
all right lean taper there's not much

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.789 
all right lean taper there's not much
display<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.630> because<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.140> arms<00:02:36.470> turn<00:02:36.590> away

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
display of it because the arms turn away

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.559 
display of it because the arms turn away
but<00:02:37.489> that's<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.880> lead<00:02:37.970> us<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.209> what<00:02:38.390> is

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
but that's going to lead us to what is

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.990 
but that's going to lead us to what is
also<00:02:38.959> being<00:02:39.110> displayed<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:39.680> being<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.310> arms

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
also being displayed here being the arms

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.940 
also being displayed here being the arms
and<00:02:41.209> shoulders<00:02:41.720> all<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.349> I<00:02:42.500> personally

feel like my arms are a strong point and

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.640 
feel like my arms are a strong point and
so<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.099> pose<00:02:46.489> with<00:02:46.849> your<00:02:46.970> hands<00:02:47.209> crossed

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
displays them quite nicely now that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.240 
displays them quite nicely now that
would<00:02:50.989> be<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.380> what<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> would<00:02:51.769> consider<00:02:51.890> to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
would be it for what I would consider to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.740 
would be it for what I would consider to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
displays down low on the ground and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.720 
displays down low on the ground and
through<00:03:24.350> those<00:03:24.530> transitions<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.340> was<00:03:25.489> able<00:03:25.609> to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
through those transitions I was able to

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.610 
through those transitions I was able to
get<00:03:25.850> myself<00:03:26.060> into<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.690> position<00:03:26.930> where<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.230> was

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
get myself into the position where I was

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.670 
get myself into the position where I was
facing<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.519> side<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.000> stage<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.680> my

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
facing the side of the stage and my

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.259 
facing the side of the stage and my
knees<00:03:30.889> were<00:03:30.920> talking<00:03:31.340> underneath<00:03:31.639> me<00:03:31.819> with<00:03:32.150> my

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
knees were talking underneath me with my

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.580 
knees were talking underneath me with my
legs<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.260> way<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.739> in<00:03:33.889> this

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
legs the way you see in this

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.640 
legs the way you see in this
and<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.580> pose<00:03:35.790> right<00:03:36.030> before<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.620> I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and the pose right before this so I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
and the pose right before this so I
originally<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.459> decided<00:03:39.030> i<00:03:39.209> would<00:03:39.269> go<00:03:40.110> ahead

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
originally then decided i would go ahead

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.740 
originally then decided i would go ahead
and<00:03:40.260> cross<00:03:40.470> my<00:03:40.739> arms<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:42.090> course<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.510> order

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
and cross my arms and of course in order

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.559 
and cross my arms and of course in order
to<00:03:42.930> display<00:03:43.379> my<00:03:43.769> arms<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.489> crowd<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:45.090> had<00:03:45.420> to

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
to display my arms to the crowd I had to

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.320 
to display my arms to the crowd I had to
twist<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.170> face<00:03:46.470> them<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.790> my<00:03:47.940> upper<00:03:48.180> body

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
twist and face them with my upper body

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.540 
twist and face them with my upper body
so<00:03:48.840> that's<00:03:49.050> how<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.170> twist<00:03:49.560> came<00:03:49.800> into<00:03:50.129> bout<00:03:50.280> I

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
so that's how the twist came into bout I

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.869 
so that's how the twist came into bout I
needed<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.420> display<00:03:52.410> my<00:03:53.129> arms<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.819> my

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
needed to display my arms and my

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.479 
needed to display my arms and my
shoulders<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:54.989> crowd<00:03:55.319> while<00:03:55.860> my<00:03:56.040> body<00:03:56.220> was

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
shoulders to the crowd while my body was

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.059 
shoulders to the crowd while my body was
still<00:03:56.700> facing<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.540> side<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.989> state<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.040> I

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
still facing the side of the state so I

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.680 
still facing the side of the state so I
ended<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.760> position<00:04:00.180> where<00:04:00.299> my<00:04:00.390> legs

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
ended up in this position where my legs

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.259 
ended up in this position where my legs
were<00:04:00.930> underneath<00:04:01.349> me<00:04:01.590> my<00:04:02.129> torso<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.790> twisting

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
were underneath me my torso was twisting

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.330 
were underneath me my torso was twisting
I<00:04:03.330> was<00:04:03.450> displaying<00:04:03.810> my<00:04:03.959> arms<00:04:04.379> but<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:04.860> wanted<00:04:05.280> to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
I was displaying my arms but I wanted to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.120 
I was displaying my arms but I wanted to
find<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.730> way<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.940> make<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.410> harder<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.799> make<00:04:07.980> it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
find a way to make it harder and make it

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.059 
find a way to make it harder and make it
more<00:04:08.340> impressive<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.630> honestly<00:04:10.140> that's<00:04:10.769> how<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
more impressive so honestly that's how I

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.650 
more impressive so honestly that's how I
got<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.790> idea<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:12.450> actually<00:04:13.010> lift<00:04:14.010> my<00:04:14.790> legs<00:04:15.120> so

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
got the idea to actually lift my legs so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.539 
got the idea to actually lift my legs so
that<00:04:15.690> would<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:15.959> extension<00:04:16.709> at<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.370> knee

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
that would be extension at the knee

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.150 
that would be extension at the knee
