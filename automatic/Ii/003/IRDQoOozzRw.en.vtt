with<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.320> theme

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
with this one and I think it's the theme

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
with this one and I think it's the theme
is<00:02:07.829> absolutely<00:02:08.310> perfect<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
is absolutely perfect for the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.470 
is absolutely perfect for the
competition<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.340> see

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
competition and see

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.059 
competition and see
when<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.900> look<00:02:12.080> at<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.290> other<00:02:12.409> guys<00:02:12.709> across

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
when you look at the other guys across

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.970 
when you look at the other guys across
the<00:02:13.159> way<00:02:13.550> especially<00:02:13.959> Jesse<00:02:14.959> James<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.860> there

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the way especially Jesse James is there

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.530 
the way especially Jesse James is there
anything<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.400> he<00:02:16.670> does<00:02:16.849> with<00:02:17.060> his<00:02:17.180> bikes

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
anything that he does with his bikes

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.350 
anything that he does with his bikes
that<00:02:17.810> you're<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.200> I'll<00:02:18.799> give<00:02:19.040> him<00:02:19.159> a<00:02:19.400> thumbs

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
up for doing that yeah I give him a

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.850 
up for doing that yeah I give him a
thumbs<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.209> all<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.750> way<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> think<00:02:24.049> that<00:02:24.470> as

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
thumbs up all the way I think that as

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.820 
thumbs up all the way I think that as
far<00:02:25.069> as<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:26.019> craftsmanship<00:02:27.019> there<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.440> nobody

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
far as a craftsmanship there is nobody

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.809 
far as a craftsmanship there is nobody
that<00:02:28.099> can<00:02:28.430> compete

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
that can compete

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.589 
that can compete
he<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:32.030> has<00:02:32.260> skills<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.489> know<00:02:34.640> he<00:02:34.849> his

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
he just has skills and you know he his

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.250 
he just has skills and you know he his
design<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> way<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.890> he<00:02:37.010> operates<00:02:37.430> us<00:02:37.579> I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
design and the way that he operates us I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.910 
design and the way that he operates us I
get<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> bit<00:02:39.920> more<00:02:40.099> primitive<00:02:40.459> than<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:41.920> then

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
get a bit more primitive than then then

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.410 
get a bit more primitive than then then
everybody<00:02:43.340> else<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> sense<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.180> you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
everybody else in the sense that you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.750 
everybody else in the sense that you
know<00:02:44.450> he's<00:02:44.720> still<00:02:44.930> hand<00:02:45.290> forges<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.730> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
know he's still hand forges and so I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
know he's still hand forges and so I
think<00:02:46.879> that's<00:02:47.290> that's<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.500> link<00:02:48.739> there<00:02:49.040> that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
think that's that's a link there that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360 
think that's that's a link there that
nobody<00:02:49.700> else<00:02:49.819> could<00:02:50.090> compete<00:02:50.629> in<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:52.010> far<00:02:52.280> as

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
nobody else could compete in as far as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.589 
nobody else could compete in as far as
doing<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:54.260> type<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.650> fabrication<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:56.030> all<00:02:56.359> of

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
doing that type of fabrication of all of

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.839 
doing that type of fabrication of all of
you<00:02:56.810> which<00:02:57.379> one<00:02:57.650> do<00:02:57.859> you<00:02:57.920> think<00:02:57.980> does<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.640> most

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
you which one do you think does the most

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.979 
you which one do you think does the most
smack-talking

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
