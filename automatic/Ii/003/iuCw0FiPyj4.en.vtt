00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the story around peter pan and how 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.270
 he once came to the neverland awaits us 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.410
 in the middle of july in German cinemas and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.880
 with that we are looking at the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.880
 second trailer of pan 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.260
 my dearest peter i crave the day 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.070
 where I come back and everything 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.200
 can explain 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.990
 I promise you will see me again 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.990
 be in this world or another 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.449
 com 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.750
 everything is 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 namely the trust I should have it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.350
 again called my name is james cook 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.210
 The little one he carries the godfather of the pan 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.210
 is the bravest warrior our stems 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:11.030
 West German to kill me Peter 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.530
 faith was not almost history 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.180
 a little bit naughty that this second one 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.040
 trailer basically just a hangover and the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 the first one is supposed to mean the whole 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.229
 moves material even in the first 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.550
 trailer here a bit 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.680
 gathered together to remember 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.850
 that few other german cinemas 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.229
 expects more precisely 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.020
 presented by warner bros 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.520
 but from 16 july 2015 I think so too 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.110
 okay so a little bit to remember 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.640
 would only have moved me a total new 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.500
 material desired because I think the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.300
 story red peter pan again and again 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.649
 exciting and not that aspect tells 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.030
 The man from the stripes knows how high 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.350
 but rather the story of 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.820
 twelve-year-old boy actually in 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.830
 a home orphanage lives and someday 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
 a world is being abducted to the neverland 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.789
 full of pirates but also indian and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.020
 fairies and other metal Galeli played 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.119
 from rooney mara and I think hugh too 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 jackman as pirates blackbeard one 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.179
 pretty cool where i appear 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.399
 I'm curious what he can do and me 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.569
 find this fantasy heavy on the movies 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.039
 always great for those too 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.569
 made a little so and a little bit 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.069
 power of vision within this trailer is 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.630
 It's really cool, so it's me 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.340
 Little wonder that is relatively little 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.929
 Attention for couples gives because I 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.910
 think that has its own 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.110
 flair and just what fantasy are concerned 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.610
 We are not that close this year 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.230
 populated in german cinemas 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.580
 at least what the stripes are there 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.140
 expected and expected at the end 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.000
 means I'm actually looking forward to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.110
 the film just a bit and creative 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.849
 for such a second trailer too 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.050
 present what do you say to that 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.700
 like to be in the comments because I am 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.110
 through at this point and leave one 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.550
 thumb there when check this trailer 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.530
 did not let it stay otherwise 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.030
 that you know, there are still left at 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.459
 me around and tomorrow 15 clock of course 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 at the latest a new video and then it 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.760
 I hope here since making again 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.760
 of course, above
