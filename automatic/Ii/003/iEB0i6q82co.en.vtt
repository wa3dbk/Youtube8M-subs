00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.880
 now 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.880
 Yes 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.990
 do you go to the end I want to say to 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.220
 my children that harmony reigns between 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.220
 men and their environment 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.440
 bt who think that utopia is a 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.349
 reffouh that quite unattainable and 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.090
 those same people who think that the only 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.130
 solution is infinite growth 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.810
 in a world that we know 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.610
 reservations are finished that's it 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.860
 completely utopian in the sense in 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.480
 which he uses the word one will change the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.000
 world the day we stop 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.570
 put the human here on a pedestal 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.860
 plumail pets 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:01:03.040
 consume more than half of the water 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:01:06.030
 available on terror autoliv a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.030
 reminded that the world 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.300
 it's not a crisis in fact it's a 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.640
 change no it's a change of 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.490
 civilization in fact it's this freedom 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.490
 there that our generation is going to have to manage 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.920
 our responsibility is to invest 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.230
 in the next revolution 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.180
 which will be that of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
 renewable energies and who will be the one 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.450
 of finally an economic model 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.450
 much more respectful of the planet 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.860
 is what it is but it follows me it is 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.810
 it's a price but here it's the same 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.980
 report to the base file that you 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 had given me but I had to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.710
 change that because it was a moment 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.320
 American peer-to-peer production 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.560
 open hardware that's it's to take 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.390
 in hand the creation of its technology and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 put me sharing values ​​of 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 sociality of mutualisation when the guy 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.480
 which manufactures a tractor must 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.260
 cheaper by hacking bolts and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.610
 stuff and stuff 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.610
 it must be said that there are tractors 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.610
 at 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.610
 Oh 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 m 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.580
