acne outbreak and it was adult acne and
it<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.220> horrendous

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it was horrendous

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.660 
it was horrendous
but<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.630> had<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.140> scars<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.550> like

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
but I had like scars because it was like

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.109 
but I had like scars because it was like
cystic<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> disgusting<00:00:27.869> stuff<00:00:28.080> but

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
cystic and all that disgusting stuff but

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.669 
cystic and all that disgusting stuff but
after<00:00:30.119> using<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> while<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.439> saw

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
after using this for like a while I saw

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.069 
after using this for like a while I saw
that<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.520> completely<00:00:33.360> gone<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.870> guess

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that it's not completely gone I guess

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.229 
that it's not completely gone I guess
because<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.590> didn't<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.399> consistently<00:00:36.059> as

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
because I didn't use it consistently as

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.350 
because I didn't use it consistently as
I<00:00:36.360> should<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.760> lightened<00:00:39.210> up

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I should have but it had lightened up

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
I should have but it had lightened up
like<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.410> scars<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> everything<00:00:41.460> cuz<00:00:41.579> it

all that stuff I'll try to find links to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
all that stuff I'll try to find links to
like<00:00:56.250> older<00:00:56.670> vlogs<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.480> our<00:00:58.260> still

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
like older vlogs on our still

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979 
like older vlogs on our still
soundlyawake<00:00:58.890> channel<00:00:59.460> where<00:01:00.120> his<00:01:00.600> skin<00:01:00.840> was

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
soundlyawake channel where his skin was

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.029 
soundlyawake channel where his skin was
like<00:01:01.170> redder<00:01:01.440> here

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
like redder here

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.240 
like redder here
I<00:01:02.070> guess<00:01:02.699> when<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.690> scars<00:01:04.320> were<00:01:04.680> still

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.940 
I guess when like the scars were still
red<00:01:05.840> right<00:01:06.840> yeah<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.159> had<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.580> took
