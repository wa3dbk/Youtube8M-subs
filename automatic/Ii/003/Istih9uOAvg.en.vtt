00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
it was really excited to try it and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.910 
it was really excited to try it and
stuff<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.180> do<00:01:59.420> like<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.870> I<00:02:00.110> find<00:02:00.770> that

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
stuff I really do like it I find that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.740 
stuff I really do like it I find that
they<00:02:01.100> are<00:02:01.250> only<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.610> couple<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.030> colors<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.600> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
they are only a couple of colors in the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.480 
they are only a couple of colors in the
actual<00:02:03.020> palette<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.410> I<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:03.770> everything

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
actual palette that I like everything

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.520 
actual palette that I like everything
else<00:02:04.760> just<00:02:05.090> seems<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.570> bit<00:02:05.600> too<00:02:05.960> kind<00:02:06.320> of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
else just seems a bit too kind of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.620 
else just seems a bit too kind of
shimmery<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.580> me<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.850> sometimes<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.450> just

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
shimmery for me and sometimes it just

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.180 
shimmery for me and sometimes it just
makes<00:02:08.810> my<00:02:08.960> eyes<00:02:09.080> look<00:02:09.110> dirty<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.740> don't<00:02:10.070> know

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
makes my eyes look dirty I don't know

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
makes my eyes look dirty I don't know
why<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:11.090> they're<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.510> as<00:02:11.660> easy<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.170> use<00:02:12.320> as

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
why but they're not as easy to use as

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.820 
why but they're not as easy to use as
compared<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.550> maybe<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.300> Mac<00:02:14.570> ones<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.710> even

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
compared to maybe the Mac ones and even

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.320 
compared to maybe the Mac ones and even
the<00:02:16.040> sleep<00:02:16.280> ones<00:02:16.550> I'm<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.060> very

the sleep ones I'm going to be very
honest<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:17.930> much<00:02:18.200> better<00:02:18.500> than<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> naked

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
this is the naked is actually really

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.330 
this is the naked is actually really
good<00:02:26.960> at<00:02:27.080> blending<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:27.890> everything<00:02:28.070> else

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
good at blending out but everything else

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.680 
good at blending out but everything else
just<00:02:28.430> seems<00:02:28.760> very<00:02:28.880> difficult<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.450> work<00:02:29.630> with

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
just seems very difficult to work with

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.500 
just seems very difficult to work with
and<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.380> found<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> only<00:02:30.830> way<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.070> can<00:02:31.220> work<00:02:31.520> well

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and I found the only way I can work well

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.140 
and I found the only way I can work well
this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.050> if<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.350> use<00:02:33.380> fix<00:02:33.860> lost<00:02:34.520> my<00:02:34.670> Mac<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.120> I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
this is if I use fix lost my Mac and I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.510 
this is if I use fix lost my Mac and I
just<00:02:35.330> want<00:02:35.510> not<00:02:35.660> too<00:02:35.900> much<00:02:36.200> effort<00:02:36.520> so

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
just want not too much effort so

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.370 
just want not too much effort so
sometimes<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.150> love<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.630> sometimes<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.170> hate

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.050 
sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate

the times it works well so I'm just one

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.970 
the times it works well so I'm just one
of<00:02:47.780> those<00:02:47.870> things<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.410> have<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.590> love-hate

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
relationship things that were most hard

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.180 
relationship things that were most hard
to<00:02:50.600> get<00:02:50.750> my<00:02:50.840> hands<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:51.260> were<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.620> NYX<00:02:51.890> products

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
to get my hands on were the NYX products

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.170 
to get my hands on were the NYX products
and<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.790> had<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:54.290> had<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> swap<00:02:55.700> with

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
and I had to get I had to do a swap with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.260 
and I had to get I had to do a swap with
Asia<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.709> my<00:02:57.800> hands<00:02:58.100> on<00:02:58.190> these<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.790> even

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
Asia to get my hands on these and even

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.400 
Asia to get my hands on these and even
though<00:02:59.360> that's<00:02:59.480> not<00:02:59.660> too<00:02:59.840> bad<00:03:00.020> doing<00:03:00.290> with

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
though that's not too bad doing with

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.650 
though that's not too bad doing with
swap<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.800> stuff<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.459> not<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:01.760> easy<00:03:02.000> as<00:03:02.150> you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
swap and stuff it's not as easy as you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.330 
swap and stuff it's not as easy as you
know<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.020> finish<00:03:03.350> something<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.860> Mac<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.070> can

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
know if I finish something in Mac I can

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.420 
know if I finish something in Mac I can
go<00:03:04.459> into<00:03:04.580> Mac<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:06.800> replenish<00:03:07.280> it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
go into Mac and you know replenish it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.759 
go into Mac and you know replenish it
but<00:03:07.850> with<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> NYX<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.959> think<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.290> might<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.620> to

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
but with the NYX I think I might have to

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.190 
but with the NYX I think I might have to
do<00:03:09.860> another<00:03:10.010> swap<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:11.570> that<00:03:11.630> bad<00:03:12.140> but

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
do another swap so it's not that bad but

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.690 
do another swap so it's not that bad but
as<00:03:12.530> compared<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.890> everything<00:03:13.160> else<00:03:13.310> having<00:03:13.610> my

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.620

confidence<00:05:26.089> because<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.770> actually<00:05:27.999> don't<00:05:28.999> have

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
confidence because I actually don't have

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.540 
confidence because I actually don't have
nice<00:05:29.779> luscious<00:05:30.139> as<00:05:30.439> my<00:05:30.649> lashes<00:05:30.919> they<00:05:31.339> grow

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
nice luscious as my lashes they grow

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.459 
nice luscious as my lashes they grow
downwards<00:05:32.119> and<00:05:32.389> so<00:05:32.539> I<00:05:32.569> always<00:05:32.899> have<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.199> use<00:05:33.439> a

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
downwards and so I always have to use a

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.399 
downwards and so I always have to use a
color<00:05:33.889> before<00:05:34.189> I<00:05:34.369> use<00:05:34.580> my<00:05:34.610> mascara<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.869> most

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
color before I use my mascara and most

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.749 
color before I use my mascara and most
times<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.860> can<00:05:37.039> leave<00:05:37.219> the<00:05:37.309> house<00:05:37.490> without

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
times I can leave the house without

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.249 
times I can leave the house without
makeup<00:05:38.149> but<00:05:38.330> then<00:05:38.449> I<00:05:38.509> always<00:05:38.809> feel<00:05:38.990> like<00:05:39.110> I

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
makeup but then I always feel like I

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.769
