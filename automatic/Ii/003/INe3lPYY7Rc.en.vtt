00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
picture The Healing Brush is pretty much

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
picture The Healing Brush is pretty much
the<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> clone<00:01:30.000> stamp<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the same as the clone stamp but it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
the same as the clone stamp but it
blends<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> surrounding<00:01:31.770> pixels<00:01:31.920> which

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
blends in the surrounding pixels which

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.440 
blends in the surrounding pixels which
means<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> you've<00:01:32.880> got<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.390> room

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
means that you've got a bit more room

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
means that you've got a bit more room
for<00:01:33.630> error<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.530> there's<00:01:34.680> any<00:01:34.799> shadows<00:01:35.340> or

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
for error so if there's any shadows or

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
for error so if there's any shadows or
different<00:01:36.030> different<00:01:36.720> colors<00:01:37.079> surrounding

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
different different colors surrounding

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
different different colors surrounding
it<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.829> it'll<00:01:37.950> blend<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.390> it

it then it'll blend those in and make it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
it then it'll blend those in and make it
look<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.869> though<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.140> more<00:01:40.439> part<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> the

look as though it's more part of the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
look as though it's more part of the
composition<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> patch<00:01:42.509> tools<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> there

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
composition and the patch tools is there

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
composition and the patch tools is there
similar<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> Healing<00:01:43.890> Brush<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.640> used

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
similar to the Healing Brush but is used

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.310 
similar to the Healing Brush but is used
for<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.090> specific<00:01:45.600> areas<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.140> situations

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
for more specific areas so in situations

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
for more specific areas so in situations
where<00:01:46.920> brushing<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.460> blur<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> image<00:01:48.030> or

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
where brushing might blur the image or

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
where brushing might blur the image or
or<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.409> shadows<00:01:49.860> appear<00:01:50.189> where<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> don't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
or make shadows appear where you don't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.859 
or make shadows appear where you don't
want<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.210> you've<00:01:51.390> got<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.750> more

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
want them so you've got a bit more

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.910 
want them so you've got a bit more
control<00:01:52.229> over<00:01:52.259> what's<00:01:53.130> selected<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> here's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
control over what's selected so here's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.319 
control over what's selected so here's
an<00:01:56.009> example<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.369> using<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> Healing<00:01:56.939> Brush<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
an example of using the Healing Brush to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
an example of using the Healing Brush to
create<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.689> area<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.930> damage<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> side<00:01:58.649> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
create an area of damage on the side of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
create an area of damage on the side of
the<00:01:58.829> photo<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.390> using

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the photo here now as you'll see using

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.830 
the photo here now as you'll see using
the<00:02:01.409> hidden<00:02:01.560> brushes<00:02:02.040> caused<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the hidden brushes caused a bit of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
the hidden brushes caused a bit of
overlap<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> color<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> Hat<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
overlap with the color from the Hat to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.740 
overlap with the color from the Hat to
give<00:02:05.729> an<00:02:05.790> area<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.119> black<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> background

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
give an area of black in the background

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
give an area of black in the background
this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> perfect<00:02:07.950> example<00:02:08.280> where<00:02:08.399> we

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
this is a perfect example where we

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760 
this is a perfect example where we
should<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.789> using<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.660> clone<00:02:09.899> stamp<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
should be using the clone stamp to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.190 
should be using the clone stamp to
exactly<00:02:11.280> copy<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.270> area<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.810> background

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
exactly copy the area of background

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.550 
exactly copy the area of background
color

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
color

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
color
over<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> damaged<00:02:14.520> area<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.300> avoid<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
over the damaged area to avoid that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.430 
over the damaged area to avoid that
blurring<00:02:17.030> exactly<00:02:18.030> yeah<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.660> alt

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
blurring exactly yeah so you just alt

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
click on a lighter area and then you can

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.800 
click on a lighter area and then you can
just<00:02:21.840> drag<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.290> stray<00:02:22.530> over<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.830> top

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
just drag that stray over the top

your<00:02:42.870> damaged<00:02:43.170> area<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.049> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
your damaged area so as you can see just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
your damaged area so as you can see just
by<00:02:46.440> doing<00:02:46.500> these<00:02:46.890> these<00:02:47.489> few<00:02:47.940> steps<00:02:48.000> already

there's a massive difference in the way
the<00:02:50.430> picture<00:02:50.610> looks<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:52.049> as<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.200> said<00:02:52.319> earlier

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the picture looks so as I said earlier

the picture looks so as I said earlier
you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.950> use<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.580> Healing<00:02:53.850> Brush<00:02:53.880> tool

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
you can now use the Healing Brush tool

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.699 
you can now use the Healing Brush tool
to<00:02:54.390> go<00:02:54.480> back<00:02:54.660> over<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.019> areas<00:02:55.290> we<00:02:55.410> use<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
to go back over the areas we use the

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.339 
to go back over the areas we use the
clone<00:02:55.920> brush<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.959> correct<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> damaged

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
clone brush and correct the damaged

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.570 
clone brush and correct the damaged
areas<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.680> much<00:02:58.830> more<00:02:59.010> detail<00:02:59.310> while<00:02:59.430> blending

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
areas in much more detail while blending

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.280 
areas in much more detail while blending
in<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.910> surrounding<00:03:00.390> pixels<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.900> smooth<00:03:01.140> out

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
in the surrounding pixels to smooth out

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.059 
in the surrounding pixels to smooth out
the<00:03:01.349> correction<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.890> originally<00:03:02.190> made<00:03:04.069> you

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
the correction you originally made you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.259 
the correction you originally made you
can<00:03:05.160> see<00:03:05.250> how<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.519> their<00:03:05.670> hidden<00:03:05.819> brush<00:03:06.060> tool

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
can see how good their hidden brush tool

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.970 
can see how good their hidden brush tool
is<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.810> clothes<00:03:07.049> here<00:03:07.319> as<00:03:07.410> well<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.830> it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
is for clothes here as well as it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.320 
is for clothes here as well as it
completely<00:03:08.280> blends<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.819> creases<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
completely blends in the creases and the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.190 
completely blends in the creases and the
shadows<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.750> give<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> natural<00:03:10.170> effect

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
shadows to give you a natural effect

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.630 
shadows to give you a natural effect
okay<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.410> we<00:03:13.470> move<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> patch<00:03:14.340> tool

that selection so as you can just see
here<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:40.140> how<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.410> replace<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.220> part<00:03:41.519> of

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the background it's also good for

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.789 
the background it's also good for
getting<00:03:44.549> rid<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:44.850> little<00:03:45.299> blemishes<00:03:45.750> or<00:03:46.380> or

the image and brought it back to its

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400 
the image and brought it back to its
former<00:03:53.549> glory<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.569> far<00:03:54.750> touch<00:03:55.019> we're<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.350> to

former glory so far touch we're going to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.830 
former glory so far touch we're going to
use<00:03:55.650> one<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.549> those<00:03:56.700> filters<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.359> reduce<00:03:57.660> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840

use one of those filters to reduce the
noise<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.350> image<00:03:58.410> here<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.430> by

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
noise in the image here we do that by

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.610 
noise in the image here we do that by
clicking<00:03:59.609> on<00:03:59.970> filter<00:04:00.180> scroll<00:04:01.139> down<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.440> noise

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
clicking on filter scroll down to noise

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.340 
clicking on filter scroll down to noise
and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.639> reduce<00:04:02.940> noise<00:04:03.180> setting<00:04:03.630> just

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
and then to reduce noise setting just

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.479 
and then to reduce noise setting just
play<00:04:04.530> around<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.859> settings<00:04:05.160> here<00:04:05.310> until

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
play around the settings here until

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.949 
play around the settings here until
you're<00:04:05.609> happy<00:04:05.730> with<00:04:05.910> them<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.420> way<00:04:06.540> appears

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.990 
you're happy with them the way appears
and<00:04:07.530> you'll<00:04:07.799> see<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.069> gives<00:04:08.250> us<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> much

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
and you'll see that gives us a much

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.490 
and you'll see that gives us a much
cleaner<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.690> kind<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.930> sharp<00:04:10.170> or<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.380> more

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
rules aren't hard or fast you can't just

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.240 
rules aren't hard or fast you can't just
change<00:04:21.730> them<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.960> suit<00:04:23.199> the<00:04:23.350> particular<00:04:23.440> photo
