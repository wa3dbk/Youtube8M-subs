00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.080

 of this diary the intention is to make all 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.430
 these books make several episodes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200
 so that's why I'm going to talk as summarizing 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.030
 each day that the video does not get 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 very long because in the first episode 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 of each book I'll talk a little more 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 about them how it works I'm going 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.420

 So you know how to use 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.070

 Donate now and I 'm fine too. 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.909
 excited to do it because the idea 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.359
 to follow 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.880
 is to do one activity per day she has 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.250
 375 super creative good activities 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.670
 different ones for you during the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.290
 year 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 so all the books that I'm going to show 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.430
 You're going to train hail from the site. 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.470
 of the hail and one thing I liked 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 enough that it was because of this that I 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.790
 I discovered the other books is that they are 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.099
 send an email informing books 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.049
 similar in the purchase indication 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.209
 so for example I bought the two books 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.340
 here and after I got received some 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.260
 and means of indicating purchases with 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 books look more or less the same 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
 format and this is how you discovered the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.959
 other books that I 'll show 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.049
 You guys, I 'm super excited to 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.810
 make another book sic flame lithography 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.269
 your life at risk is intrinsic and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.910
 His purpose is very different, very cool. 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.069
 is for you to literally make lists of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 things in your life have your songs 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.980
 favorite food sites preferred 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.349
 previous jobs best friends have 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.780
 It is not everything I found quite different from the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.879
 very cool purpose and stay with a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.099
 remember later why you end up in the 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.599
 time you have to make lists reminding 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.639
 of previous things 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.019
 so I wake up and things are fine 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.389
 fun to do 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.430
 I'm crazy to show you everything. 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.069
 another book this one build your 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.989
 diary is very similar to the purpose of 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.280
 destroy the daily activities well 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.500
 different 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.970
 but not from the same author, does not have 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.609
 nothing to do with each other 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.919
 just the title good-looking and it's pretty cool 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.410
 also has several different activities 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.359
 already looking at things so well placed 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.940
 to do I think you'll like 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.889
 another book this ends this book 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.440
 is the same author of the study that daily 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.200
 and atlantis physics and this one has a 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
 very different goal that is yourself 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.160
 You have to become a detective to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.620
 unravel the mysteries so I found it well 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.989
 cool but it's a bit trickier to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.359
 perform tasks because too much 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.310
 outside the house but I do not 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.319
 strive to make everything pretty good 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.019
 one of the last books I bought was 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.359
 this one I but you are like us one 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.389
 book to fill out together I found it well 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.710
 legal purpose are also diverse 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.840
 activities well 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.850
 different but I like him and you 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.220
 do with someone else with your girlfriend 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.120
 of her husband with her best friend with 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.700
 your sister 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.740
 I think it's cool because every activity 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
 What do you ask for you to do for someone else? 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.550
 also the last two books I 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.400
 I bought and even get to this week were 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.890
 these here this first one here is mandala 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.090
 the one magic I think has two or 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.680
 three serve 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.230
 and I bought it because when I went 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.120
 buy this other this good indication 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.370
 on the site then I ended up with 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.950
 Curiosity to see what it was like 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.620
 very cheap and thus has several 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.630
 pages with drawings to send them to 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.970
 You same color and then you go 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.890
 filling the crayon and pencil 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.800
 using creativity thus leaving well 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.810
 so I liked it a lot and if 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.480
 really cool to fill out or 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.150
 buy two the tre too and last book 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.120
 This is the secret garden here . 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.190
 coloring treasure hunt anti-stress 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.380
 purpose of living very well as well. 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.830
 excited to do it it comes like this 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.120
 with blank pages various designs 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.040
 garden mandalas 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.690
 His differential is not just for 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.860
 to paint to leave the way 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.110
 that you like 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.660
 cool it as you go to color 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.730
 on two pages you have to find 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.100
 hidden in the little bird's drawing 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.050
 butterfly beetle and in the beginning have a 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.060
 content that the little critters you have to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.100
 find I 'm sure it will stay 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.160
 very colorful because I love things 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.710
 You already know this and I liked it. 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.380
 enough so let's go are eight books 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.600
 books all have enough pages I 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.060
 I decided to do the following 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.010
 Wednesday I'm going to put the episode of 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.080

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.640

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.530
 inspirational part as it allows 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.900
 because there are some who have external debt 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.700
 there are others that have activity in water 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.220

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.050

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.510
