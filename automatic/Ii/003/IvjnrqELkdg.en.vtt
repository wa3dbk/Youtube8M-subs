00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.050
 let's paint right now with paintings 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.850
 eternal and of course with the young lady 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.400
 monica godfroid teacher that every time 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.400
 enter nicer things to show us and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 good 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.220
 we are going to use acrylic enamels and in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.650
 this case, notice that we already use it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.680
 on glass over 5 black micos on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 wood on all surface in this 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.149
 moment about 40 of what I did was about 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 I found them individual 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.880
 modern at least my daughters who 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.700
 they are much younger than I liked them or 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.800
 be it a design I think 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 interesting to take the kitchen 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.510
 apart so you do not get fans bring the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.809
 brand table on red table 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.460
 how do we work in what you have to have 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.489
 in mind always remember that the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.420
 acrylic enamel who needs me 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.220
 stir it with a skewer stick 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.220
 before starting to work to form 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.229
 well that of murcia well are 42 colors 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.299
 those who have eternal with these enamels 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.360
 acrylics so we have to work 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 a good bunch, look, I worked with these 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.479
 very designs 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 stylized and what I did in the drawings 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.510
 if we first do the fund is 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.580
 black acrylic enamel that you know 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.860
 we all know that to work with the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 liner what we need is to stretch a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.110
 little paint with water pads 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.509
 then draw look how some 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.479
 little hearts coupled and there I go to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.540
 work I did only the outline of the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.270
 little bird like that and what I want you to see 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.870
 it's also that well that slips on 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.230
 the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.250
 about the woman and the dawn which ina 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.160
 I made the piquito this little bird I do his 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.420
 his eye and now I start to decorate it there is a 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.790
 drawing method that is to sit you down 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.080
 they call central and they look for it in English 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.060
 med with zeta 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.550
 there are many very interesting designs and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.320
 They are very modern and what is it about? 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.070
 draw and let go 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.030
 or repeat patterns repeat strokes and 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.820
 there you are forming you in this case you 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.850
 little birds and we finish these clearings in 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.740
 unique designs the whole mind is based on 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.270
 the repetition in the repetition of 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.880
 exactly and in this case I did 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.740
 alone on the white hill and the other 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.950
 that you see that the boys should not 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.380
 have taken is painted with enamel 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.790
 and then worked on good this one what 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.610
 I leave there 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 and migrant 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.920
 and we're going to make the tail and you're 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.770
 little feet like this I'm going to do all the bottom of 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.080
 this tablecloth and now I'm going to work 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:10.070
 about the main month exactly and here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.410
 I worked we had said that the enamels 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.510
 I can mix those together then to 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.690
 make the light blue bay a bit clearer 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.510
 I will place the white color in the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.330
 center to give light to this little bird to 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.670
 this to the chest of the bird and then I go 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.390
 with the celestial bay but notice that 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.880
 hold that you have bone 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.790
 about these materials work 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.550
 perfect are and apart the texture that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.430
 has not lost or is not rigid you do not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.850
 It stiffens is rather therein and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.819
 we can clean it perfectly 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.400
 medium reference perfectly 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.409
 or is it really a simple job 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.859
 I what I bring as usual 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.200
 is the idea of work after each one 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.870
 is going to make its own design and its own 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.959
 I work there I also go with the celeste 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.799
 varies in what is the little head 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.889
 quick a very practical job and 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.650
 fast using acrylic enamels 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.750
 this does not need any protection the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.359
 acrylic enamel grabs on anyone 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.780
 laver physical and I do not need protection 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.660
 later more and now I'm going to do it 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.590
 while dry is a little bit I'm going to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.009
 do what is the plumage of the wings and 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.660
 there I worked also mixing the white 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:37.410
 yes and then this turquoise color and what 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.419
 what I want to show you is a little bit like 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.070
 work is actually the same job 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.270
 what I did in the little bird but how 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.640
 the black works on him 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.640
 and there if you start to create 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.800
 I'm going to let you take that I was reading 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.990
 that this method is either someone put him 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.150
 name but that's what we do when 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.010
 example we talk because it is exactly 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.010
 things that I always google 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.730
 ahao glasses sweet because it will be that 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.820
 I want to see further in a few years 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:19.580
 we get together and we'll see if it 's what you 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.230
 you thought I would draw good little boy 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.000
 there is six is ​​the drawing that you are going 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:28.300
 doing without thinking or being drawn 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.420
 to doodle and the design is coming out 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.360
 think about everything else dragon is looking for me 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.730
 as of course white magazine in the 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.450
 eternal magazine you will find it in 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.360
 all the artistic bookstores in the country 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.580
 there is full of ideas projects from 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.990
 notes and as we always say are 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:55.240
 triggers to get the best out of voice 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.910
 that you have and can apply it 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.740
 in everything you can think of and even 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.500
 of course in the classes of mónica 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.139

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.720
 I'm going to buy the 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.460

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.490

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:27.130
