00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
on our hero camera to do this we're

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.080 
on our hero camera to do this we're
gonna<00:00:10.260> boot<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> camera<00:00:10.920> up<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.460> pressing<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
gonna boot the camera up by pressing the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.720 
gonna boot the camera up by pressing the
power<00:00:12.330> mode<00:00:12.630> button<00:00:12.990> once<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:14.340> camera<00:00:14.639> will

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
power mode button once the camera will

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.420 
power mode button once the camera will
boot<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.030> then<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:16.020> will<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.619> mode<00:00:17.100> button

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
boot up then we will use the mode button

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
boot up then we will use the mode button
again<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.060> scroll<00:00:18.420> through<00:00:18.449> until<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
again to scroll through until we get to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.310 
again to scroll through until we get to
settings<00:00:23.210> once<00:00:24.210> we're<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.930> settings<00:00:25.230> menu

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
settings once we're at the settings menu

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
settings once we're at the settings menu
we'll<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> shutter<00:00:26.460> button<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> select

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we'll use the shutter button to select

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
we'll use the shutter button to select
it<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.340> our<00:00:29.519> first<00:00:29.849> option

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it and then we get our first option

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.479 
it and then we get our first option
which<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.630> resolution<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.130> wanted<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
which is resolution if you wanted to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549 
which is resolution if you wanted to
change<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.239> setting<00:00:33.570> we'll<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.290> shutter

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
change the setting we'll use the shutter

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
change the setting we'll use the shutter
button<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.980> enter<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.550> options<00:00:36.450> menu<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
button to enter the options menu of that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.990 
button to enter the options menu of that
particular<00:00:37.770> option<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.670> we'll<00:00:38.790> use<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
particular option so we'll use the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.459 
particular option so we'll use the
shutter<00:00:39.149> button<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> enter<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
shutter button here to enter this and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.369 
shutter button here to enter this and
then<00:00:41.219> we'll<00:00:41.489> use<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.820> mode<00:00:42.390> button<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:43.020> scroll

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
then we'll use the mode button to scroll

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
then we'll use the mode button to scroll
through<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> power<00:00:44.309> mode<00:00:44.550> button

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
through them so the power mode button

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
through them so the power mode button
here<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> front<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.960> options<00:00:46.379> are

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
here in the front so our options are

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.630 
here in the front so our options are
1080p<00:00:47.250> 30<00:00:47.899> 720p<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> super<00:00:49.559> view<00:00:49.710> 60<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.280> super

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
1080p 30 720p is super view 60 so super

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.540 
1080p 30 720p is super view 60 so super
view<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> dynamic<00:00:51.690> scaling<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.530> 4x3<00:00:53.010> image

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
view is a dynamic scaling of a 4x3 image

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.299 
view is a dynamic scaling of a 4x3 image
if<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> 16<00:00:54.239> by<00:00:54.390> 9<00:00:54.420> aspect<00:00:54.660> ratio<00:00:55.309> basically

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
if it's 16 by 9 aspect ratio basically

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
if it's 16 by 9 aspect ratio basically
what<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.820> does<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> captures<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.719> 4<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.410> 3

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
what this does is it captures a 4 by 3

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.700 
what this does is it captures a 4 by 3
image<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.969> very<00:01:00.449> square<00:01:00.870> image<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.350> then

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
image like a very square image and then

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
image like a very square image and then
it<00:01:01.800> dynamically<00:01:02.370> scales<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.660> outside

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it dynamically scales using the outside

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.340 
it dynamically scales using the outside
edges<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.430> stretch<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.270> fill<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> 16<00:01:07.200> by<00:01:07.320> 9

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
edges to stretch to fill that 16 by 9

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.080 
edges to stretch to fill that 16 by 9
aspect<00:01:07.530> ratio<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> creates<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.880> more

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
aspect ratio so it creates a more

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.590 
aspect ratio so it creates a more
immersive<00:01:09.770> view<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.970> next<00:01:12.240> option

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
immersive view and then the next option

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.370 
immersive view and then the next option
is<00:01:12.810> 1080p<00:01:13.619> 60<00:01:13.979> loses<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> standard<00:01:14.970> KP<00:01:15.479> 60<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
is 1080p 60 loses a standard KP 60 and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.679 
is 1080p 60 loses a standard KP 60 and
so<00:01:17.040> we'll<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> 1080p<00:01:17.700> 30<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> then

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so we'll set it to 1080p 30 and then

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
so we'll set it to 1080p 30 and then
once<00:01:18.900> we've<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.860> settings<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.280> want

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
once we've got the settings we want

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
once we've got the settings we want
we'll<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> shutter<00:01:21.570> button<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> select

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
we'll use the shutter button to select

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
we'll use the shutter button to select
them<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> save<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:24.170> they<00:01:25.170> making<00:01:25.350> use<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
them and save them they making use a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
them and save them they making use a
mode<00:01:25.710> button<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.100> scroll<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.850> what

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
mode button to scroll down and see what

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
mode button to scroll down and see what
else<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.330> change<00:01:27.710> we<00:01:28.710> could<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.979> spot

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
else we can change we could have spot

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
else we can change we could have spot
metering<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.090> use<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> enable<00:01:30.720> spot

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
metering so if we use to enable spot

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.149 
metering so if we use to enable spot
metering<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> would<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> would

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
metering it would mean that it would

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.730 
metering it would mean that it would
instead<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
instead of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
instead of
waiting<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> entire<00:01:35.189> image<00:01:35.430> properly<00:01:36.150> for

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
waiting the entire image properly for

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
waiting the entire image properly for
exposure<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.530> would<00:01:37.680> Center<00:01:38.400> weight<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
exposure it would Center weight it and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
exposure it would Center weight it and
weight<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.689> meaning<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.170> whatever<00:01:40.350> was<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
weight it meaning that whatever was in

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
weight it meaning that whatever was in
the<00:01:40.829> center<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> shot<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the center of the shot would get the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
the center of the shot would get the
highest<00:01:42.750> priority<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.350> metering<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
highest priority in metering and the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.139 
highest priority in metering and the
camera<00:01:44.369> wouldn't<00:01:44.610> worry<00:01:44.790> too<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.000> about

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
camera wouldn't worry too much about

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.510 
camera wouldn't worry too much about
exposing<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> outside<00:01:46.470> edges<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> frame
