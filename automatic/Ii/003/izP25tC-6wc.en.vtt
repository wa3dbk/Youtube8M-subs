00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.960

 this great boxer and they put him another no 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.200
 package but if it's true that you do not 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.590
 they put someone who has as much cache as 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 could have an andrew or have a 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.840
 cockpit strain or could have someone 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.720
 like millaje and preserve that although it is very 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.060
 very small for the weight but it could 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.390
 be with him if a trajectory of 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.510
 know 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.360
 has fought with tractors stephens has 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.060
 fought against the blond who has failed 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.970
 whenever you tried to get on that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.950
 step of the big leagues boxing 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.520
 is facing people like the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.470
 pink that has not won anyone from 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.220
 note no no 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.430
 does not end anything to put on being that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.480
 boxer who faces the best fate 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.670
 that takes a long time and many years 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.550
 facing the classes and the six and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 arts and boxing's time 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 tongo flash and hb or put him in 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:57.670
 contests that are not 50 50 that are 40 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.560
 40 60 not where is that is the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.540
 cockiness of the years they wanted to fight 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.850
 to everyone the whole world is that 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.340
 out of 154 to 175 pounds is no longer like that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.290
 now they no longer want proof in the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.060
 160 now you know what to 160 also 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.340
 or whatever it is they do not want or even 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.709
 they want to see I do not understand it very well 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
 what they are doing with congo 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.240
 the kings he is a tremendous fighter and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.600
 a lot of power of fists but it will go 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.920
 again against more inri than if it is not a 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.190
 embezzler why not 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.900
 a boxer has faced Felix turn 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.500
 and has faced sergio maravilla 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.940
 martÃ­nez and both times he has stayed 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.250
 short is not someone who kills you 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.670
 nobody and that has been world champion 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:58.540
 so nobody all right I think 567 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 round and see if they give someone a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.860
 little bit more a little stronger leave 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.360
 the comments agree is not 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.630
 agree with me the box I do it 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.630
 people
