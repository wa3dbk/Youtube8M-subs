people<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.310> game<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.579> copying

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
people think this game is copying

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
people think this game is copying
titanfall<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> trailer<00:01:31.680> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
titanfall because of the trailer but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
titanfall because of the trailer but
what<00:01:32.460> people<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.759> realize<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> this

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
what people don't realize is that this

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.999 
what people don't realize is that this
game<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.110> been<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.380> development<00:01:34.530> for

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
game has been in development for

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.420 
game has been in development for
three-plus<00:01:35.909> years<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.930> technical<00:01:37.680> before

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
three-plus years so technical before

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.249 
three-plus years so technical before
they<00:01:38.610> could<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.090> liked<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:40.140> not

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
they could not have liked it it's not

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.539 
they could not have liked it it's not
like<00:01:40.350> titanfall<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.920> released<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.369> said

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
like titanfall was released they said

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
like titanfall was released they said
okay<00:01:41.790> let's<00:01:41.909> add<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.360> shit<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
okay let's add all this shit into this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
okay let's add all this shit into this
game<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.100> wasn't<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> guys

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
game it really wasn't like that guys

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.359 
game it really wasn't like that guys
because<00:01:45.360> titanfall<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.170> called<00:01:46.920> did<00:01:47.100> events

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
because titanfall or called did events

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
because titanfall or called did events
warfare<00:01:47.670> has<00:01:47.759> been<00:01:47.970> development<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
warfare has been development for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
warfare has been development for
three-plus<00:01:49.229> years<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.250> could

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
three-plus years so they really could

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
three-plus years so they really could
not<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.610> copied<00:01:50.909> titanfall<00:01:51.240> unless

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
not have copied titanfall unless

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
not have copied titanfall unless
titanfall<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.200> supported<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> whole

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
titanfall like supported them the whole

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
titanfall like supported them the whole
way<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:54.000> obviously<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> case

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
way but obviously that was not the case

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
way but obviously that was not the case
so<00:01:55.799> um<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.880> another<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.509> has<00:01:57.689> been

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
so um now another thing that has been

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
so um now another thing that has been
confirmed<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> year<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
confirmed is that the year that this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.800 
confirmed is that the year that this
will<00:01:59.880> all<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.090> taking<00:02:00.360> place<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.719> know

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
will all be taking place in you know

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.840 
will all be taking place in you know
every<00:02:01.020> company<00:02:01.409> has<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> time<00:02:02.189> period<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
every company has a time period that is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.289 
every company has a time period that is
taking<00:02:03.180> place<00:02:03.210> black<00:02:04.079> ops<00:02:04.229> 2<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.530> 2025<00:02:05.299> 1043

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
taking place black ops 2 is 2025 1043

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.719 
taking place black ops 2 is 2025 1043
was<00:02:06.659> obviously<00:02:07.049> modern<00:02:07.500> call<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.550> duty

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
was obviously modern call of duty

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.809 
was obviously modern call of duty
advanced<00:02:08.940> warfare<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> 2050<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.160> my

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
advanced warfare will be in 2050 for my

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.430 
advanced warfare will be in 2050 for my
opinions<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:12.690> pretty<00:02:12.930> excited<00:02:13.050> guys

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
opinions on this I'm pretty excited guys

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.910 
opinions on this I'm pretty excited guys
because

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
because

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
because
the<00:02:14.310> thing<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:14.940> futuristic

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the thing that I like about futuristic

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
the thing that I like about futuristic
games<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.819> ability

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
games is that you they have the ability

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
games is that you they have the ability
to<00:02:18.209> stretch<00:02:18.510> reality<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.319> they<00:02:19.950> don't

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to stretch reality you know they don't

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.470 
to stretch reality you know they don't
have<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.459> modern<00:02:20.760> warfare<00:02:20.880> obviously<00:02:21.420> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
have to like modern warfare obviously is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.420 
have to like modern warfare obviously is
modern<00:02:21.900> warfare<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.739> know<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.040> simple<00:02:23.370> as

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
modern warfare you know it's simple as

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
modern warfare you know it's simple as
that<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.819> base<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:24.390> modern

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that you have to base it off modern

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
that you have to base it off modern
things<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.319> are<00:02:25.410> happening<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.980> when<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
things that are happening and when you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.600 
things that are happening and when you
put<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> game<00:02:27.900> against<00:02:28.770> time<00:02:29.010> zone<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
put a game against time zone in the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.210 
put a game against time zone in the
future<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.810> makes<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.350> or<00:02:31.920> time

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
future that makes it so that or time

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.830 
future that makes it so that or time
period<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.819> future<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> makes<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.630> that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
period in the future that makes it that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.990 
period in the future that makes it that
so<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.739> game<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.910> can

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so that the game can you know you can

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
so that the game can you know you can
stretch<00:02:36.239> reality<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.900> make<00:02:37.319> things<00:02:37.620> up

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
stretch reality you can make things up

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.620 
stretch reality you can make things up
things<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> don't<00:02:38.610> exist<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.060> yeah<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.480> mean

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
things that don't exist but yeah I mean

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.570 
things that don't exist but yeah I mean
maybe<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.080> think<00:02:40.410> they'll<00:02:40.530> exist<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.100> that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
maybe you think they'll exist in that

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.180 
maybe you think they'll exist in that
time<00:02:41.819> zone<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.690> time<00:02:42.900> period<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
time zone or that time period but you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.589 
time zone or that time period but you
don't<00:02:44.370> really<00:02:44.640> know<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.330> make

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
don't really know so you can just make

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.120 
don't really know so you can just make
stuff<00:02:45.840> up<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.709> what<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.069> about

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
stuff up and that's what I like about

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.070 
stuff up and that's what I like about
this<00:02:47.760> game<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.120> far<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.630> saw<00:02:48.780> some

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
this game so far you know we saw some

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.710 
this game so far you know we saw some
like<00:02:49.230> exoskeleton<00:02:50.069> suits<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.970> preview<00:02:51.360> or

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
like exoskeleton suits in the preview or

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.509 
like exoskeleton suits in the preview or
the<00:02:51.900> trailer<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.440> game<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:53.069> obviously

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the trailer for the game that obviously

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.949 
the trailer for the game that obviously
we've<00:02:53.670> never<00:02:53.850> seen<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.150> real<00:02:54.239> warfare<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
we've never seen in real warfare and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.479 
we've never seen in real warfare and
that's<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.260> stretching<00:02:55.709> reality<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.250> think

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
that's just stretching reality I think

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.220 
that's just stretching reality I think

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
boost jump personally guys I think that

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.810 
boost jump personally guys I think that
would<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.739> pretty<00:03:49.829> cool<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.370> think<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.640> adds<00:03:50.760> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
would be pretty cool I think it adds a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.030 
would be pretty cool I think it adds a
nice<00:03:50.940> twist<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.480> game<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.620> said<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.859> like

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
nice twist of the game as I said I like

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.500 
nice twist of the game as I said I like
Call<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.280> Duty<00:03:53.489> being<00:03:53.670> realistic<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.420> when

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
Call of Duty being realistic but when

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.120 
Call of Duty being realistic but when
they<00:03:54.600> do<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:54.989> boost<00:03:55.230> jump<00:03:55.380> i<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.829> it's<00:03:55.950> i

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
they do at boost jump i think it's i

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.229 
they do at boost jump i think it's i
don't<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:56.760> making<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.090> too

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
don't think it's making it too

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.059 
don't think it's making it too
unrealistic<00:03:57.750> i<00:03:58.079> think<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.680> could<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:58.980> a

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
unrealistic i think this could be a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.380 
unrealistic i think this could be a
possible<00:03:59.549> thing<00:03:59.760> they<00:03:59.970> could<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
possible thing they could have in the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.660 
possible thing they could have in the
future<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.870> even<00:04:01.380> if<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.620> isn't<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.519> still

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
future and even if it isn't it's still

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.920

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
with you if you thought i was serious I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.770 
with you if you thought i was serious I
don't<00:04:25.409> really<00:04:25.500> care<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.130> mean<00:04:26.340> climbing<00:04:26.760> walls

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
don't really care I mean climbing walls

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.420 
don't really care I mean climbing walls
you<00:04:28.230> know<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.560> maybe<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.010> would<00:04:29.100> be<00:04:29.190> cool<00:04:29.400> but

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
you know it maybe it would be cool but

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.980 
you know it maybe it would be cool but
personally<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.510> don't<00:04:30.570> really<00:04:30.750> want<00:04:30.960> to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
personally I just I don't really want to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.140 
personally I just I don't really want to
see<00:04:31.139> it<00:04:31.230> B<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.740> called<00:04:32.070> Diddy<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.120> how

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
see it B is called Diddy is I like how

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.670 
see it B is called Diddy is I like how
it's<00:04:33.360> realistic<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.990> boosts<00:04:34.170> jumping<00:04:34.530> is

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
it's realistic and boosts jumping is

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.070 
it's realistic and boosts jumping is
making<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.639> little<00:04:35.820> unrealistic<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:36.900> too

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
making a little unrealistic but not too

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.900 
making a little unrealistic but not too
unrealistic<00:04:37.470> work<00:04:37.830> as<00:04:38.070> climbing<00:04:38.460> walls<00:04:38.639> is

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
unrealistic work as climbing walls is

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.909 
unrealistic work as climbing walls is
kind<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.300> stupid<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:39.870> opinion<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.440> guess

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
kind of stupid in my opinion I guess

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.560 
kind of stupid in my opinion I guess
it's<00:04:41.130> more<00:04:41.370> realistic<00:04:41.669> than<00:04:41.880> boost<00:04:42.180> jumping

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
it's more realistic than boost jumping

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
it's more realistic than boost jumping
but<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.720> don't<00:04:42.900> know<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.050> don't<00:04:43.200> really<00:04:43.320> want<00:04:43.560> to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
but I don't know I don't really want to

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.320 
but I don't know I don't really want to
see<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.770> as<00:04:43.950> well<00:04:44.520> as<00:04:44.610> cloaking<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.120> don't

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
see it as well as cloaking I don't

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.610 
see it as well as cloaking I don't
really<00:04:45.510> want<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.720> see<00:04:45.780> cloaking<00:04:46.169> either<00:04:46.320> I

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
really want to see cloaking either I

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.830 
really want to see cloaking either I
just<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.430> don't<00:04:47.580> see<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.000> being<00:04:48.060> call<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.570> duty

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
just I don't see that being call of duty

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.420 
just I don't see that being call of duty
i<00:04:48.870> see<00:04:49.139> call<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.410> duty<00:04:49.590> being<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.919> game<00:04:50.130> that

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
i see call of duty being that game that

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.390 
i see call of duty being that game that
is<00:04:50.610> as<00:04:51.270> i<00:04:51.419> said<00:04:51.600> as<00:04:51.810> I've<00:04:51.960> said<00:04:52.110> before

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
is as i said as I've said before

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.920 
is as i said as I've said before
realistic<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.610> cloaking<00:04:54.360> just<00:04:54.660> adds<00:04:54.840> that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
realistic and cloaking just adds that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.870 
realistic and cloaking just adds that
unrealistic<00:04:55.320> factor<00:04:55.860> like<00:04:56.130> that's<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.460> way

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
unrealistic factor like that's like way

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.580 
unrealistic factor like that's like way
in<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.120> future<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.600> do<00:04:57.900> not<00:04:58.080> believe<00:04:58.230> that<00:04:58.500> we

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
in the future I do not believe that we

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.740 
in the future I do not believe that we
will<00:04:58.680> have<00:04:58.740> then<00:04:58.950> 2054<00:04:59.820> guys<00:05:00.030> I'm<00:05:00.300> not<00:05:00.630> really

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
will have then 2054 guys I'm not really

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.409 
will have then 2054 guys I'm not really
too<00:05:00.960> caught<00:05:01.919> up<00:05:01.950> with<00:05:02.160> technology<00:05:02.430> in<00:05:02.940> warfare

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
too caught up with technology in warfare

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.790 
too caught up with technology in warfare
but<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.930> just<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.200> don't<00:05:04.260> believe<00:05:04.500> will<00:05:04.680> have

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
but I just I don't believe will have

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.680 
but I just I don't believe will have
that<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:05.160> next<00:05:05.850> thing<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:05.970> running<00:05:06.210> longer<00:05:06.510> you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
that I next thing is running longer you

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.940 
that I next thing is running longer you
know<00:05:06.720> I'm<00:05:06.960> totally<00:05:07.380> fine<00:05:07.560> with<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.800> we

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
know I'm totally fine with this we

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.050 
know I'm totally fine with this we
already<00:05:08.040> have<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.250> perk<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.669> does<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:09.000> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
already have a perk that does this and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.290 
already have a perk that does this and
if<00:05:09.600> we<00:05:10.260> get<00:05:10.890> rid<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.310> perk<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.700> put<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:12.090> on

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
if we get rid of the perk and put it on

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.270 
if we get rid of the perk and put it on
the<00:05:12.360> exoskeleton<00:05:13.290> then<00:05:13.770> yeah<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.160> would<00:05:14.250> be

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
the exoskeleton then yeah that would be

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.130 
the exoskeleton then yeah that would be
pretty<00:05:14.430> cool<00:05:14.580> I'm<00:05:15.060> kind<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.419> basing<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:15.990> off

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
pretty cool I'm kind of basing this off

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.050 
pretty cool I'm kind of basing this off
multiplayer<00:05:16.890> so<00:05:17.430> we<00:05:17.580> don't<00:05:17.730> really<00:05:17.850> know<00:05:18.030> if

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
multiplayer so we don't really know if

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.820 
multiplayer so we don't really know if
it's<00:05:18.270> gonna<00:05:18.360> be<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:18.630> multiplayer<00:05:19.050> but<00:05:19.380> we<00:05:19.650> do

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
it's gonna be in multiplayer but we do

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.530 
it's gonna be in multiplayer but we do
know<00:05:19.979> it's<00:05:20.100> in<00:05:20.190> single<00:05:20.490> player<00:05:20.520> but<00:05:20.940> hopefully

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
know it's in single player but hopefully

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.570 
know it's in single player but hopefully
we'll<00:05:21.750> all<00:05:21.870> make<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.140> in<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.290> multiplayer<00:05:22.740> and

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
we'll all make it in the multiplayer and

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.640 
we'll all make it in the multiplayer and
then<00:05:23.850> super<00:05:24.210> strength<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.720> do<00:05:25.050> not<00:05:25.260> know<00:05:25.410> what

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
then super strength I do not know what

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.930 
then super strength I do not know what
this<00:05:25.830> will<00:05:25.979> be<00:05:26.070> useful<00:05:26.280> i<00:05:26.580> don't<00:05:26.760> know<00:05:26.820> it's

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
this will be useful i don't know it's

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.610 
this will be useful i don't know it's
going<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.090> be<00:05:27.150> used<00:05:27.389> for<00:05:27.479> like<00:05:27.690> super<00:05:28.169> melees

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
going to be used for like super melees

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.830 
going to be used for like super melees
like<00:05:29.340> punching<00:05:29.880> through<00:05:30.060> walls<00:05:30.419> there's

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
like punching through walls there's

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.590 
like punching through walls there's
extractable<00:05:31.590> maps<00:05:31.830> who<00:05:32.370> knows<00:05:32.550> but<00:05:33.120> yeah

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
extractable maps who knows but yeah

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.630 
extractable maps who knows but yeah
those<00:05:33.750> are<00:05:33.900> the<00:05:34.050> top<00:05:34.229> five<00:05:34.470> strengths<00:05:34.890> or<00:05:35.010> d5

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
those are the top five strengths or d5

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.990 
those are the top five strengths or d5
strength<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.840> exoskeleton<00:05:37.560> has<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.700> now

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
strength that the exoskeleton has so now

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.580 
strength that the exoskeleton has so now
in<00:05:39.120> terms<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.419> multiplayer<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.169> has<00:05:40.440> been

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
in terms of multiplayer it has been

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.530 
in terms of multiplayer it has been
rumored<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.310> do<00:05:41.370> stress<00:05:41.729> rumored<00:05:42.360> that

rumored and I do stress rumored that

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.719 
rumored and I do stress rumored that
these<00:05:42.990> killstreaks<00:05:43.860> will<00:05:44.100> revolve<00:05:44.460> around

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
these killstreaks will revolve around

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.909 
these killstreaks will revolve around
the<00:05:44.910> exoskeleton<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:45.990> again<00:05:46.260> guys<00:05:46.440> this<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:46.800> a

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.230 
the exoskeleton and again guys this is a
rumor<00:05:47.280> it's<00:05:47.490> not<00:05:47.669> confirmed<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:49.200> I<00:05:50.240> personally

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
rumor it's not confirmed so I personally

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.150 
rumor it's not confirmed so I personally
think<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.110> would<00:05:52.200> be<00:05:52.350> kind<00:05:52.740> of<00:05:52.770> stupid

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
think that that would be kind of stupid

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.800 
think that that would be kind of stupid
if<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.400> all<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.669> killstreaks<00:05:54.060> revolved

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
if the all the killstreaks revolved

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.930 
if the all the killstreaks revolved
around<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.110> exoskeleton<00:05:55.800> mainly<00:05:56.460> because<00:05:56.490> I

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
around the exoskeleton mainly because I

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.850 
around the exoskeleton mainly because I
think<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.510> would<00:05:57.600> just<00:05:57.660> be<00:05:57.840> bland<00:05:58.200> you<00:05:58.470> know<00:05:58.530> I

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
think it would just be bland you know I

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.529 
think it would just be bland you know I
like<00:05:59.280> having<00:05:59.520> like<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.669> chopper<00:05:59.970> gunner<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.360> like

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
to see that I think it'd be kind of dumb

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.400 
to see that I think it'd be kind of dumb
and<00:06:26.220> I'd<00:06:26.910> rather<00:06:27.270> have<00:06:27.510> an<00:06:27.600> advanced<00:06:27.930> warfare

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
and I'd rather have an advanced warfare

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.020

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
chopper gunner you know I just thought

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.850 
chopper gunner you know I just thought
that<00:06:30.090> would<00:06:30.330> be<00:06:30.360> cooler<00:06:30.630> so<00:06:30.960> anyways<00:06:31.680> guys

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
that would be cooler so anyways guys

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.100 
that would be cooler so anyways guys
