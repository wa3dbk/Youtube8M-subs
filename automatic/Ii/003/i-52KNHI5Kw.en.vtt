Marshall<00:00:25.949> Shepard<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.430> mean<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.910> say

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
Marshall Shepard I mean I like to say

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
Marshall Shepard I mean I like to say
that<00:00:27.119> size<00:00:27.539> does<00:00:27.930> matter<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.619> regard<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that size does matter in this regard and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.840 
that size does matter in this regard and
sandy<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.019> large<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.219> large<00:00:32.550> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
sandy it was so large so large that

with<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.460> knew<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.330> gonna

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
does when it makes landfall because it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.109 
does when it makes landfall because it
was<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.710> transition<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> storm

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
was just gonna transition from a storm

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
was just gonna transition from a storm
that<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.020> getting<00:01:22.290> its<00:01:22.409> energy<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
energy from the atmosphere the so called

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
storm or nor'easter really interesting

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
storm or nor'easter really interesting
because<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.049> had<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.590> late<00:01:34.920> season

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because we had this really late season

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
because we had this really late season
hurricane<00:01:36.000> phasing<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.439> with

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
hurricane phasing up if you will with

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
hurricane phasing up if you will with
this<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:38.100> early<00:01:38.520> season<00:01:39.030> nor'easter<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this really early season nor'easter and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
this really early season nor'easter and
then<00:01:40.049> remember<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> bizarre<00:01:41.009> left<00:01:41.460> turn

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then remember that bizarre left turn

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
then remember that bizarre left turn
sandy<00:01:42.479> took<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.619> another<00:01:44.009> weather

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
sandy took that was another weather

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
sandy took that was another weather
system<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:45.180> play<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> big<00:01:46.259> area<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.740> high

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
system at play we had a big area of high

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
system at play we had a big area of high
pressure<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.090> north<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
pressure up to the north that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
pressure up to the north that
essentially<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> big<00:01:50.460> roadblock<00:01:50.729> if

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
essentially was like a big roadblock if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
essentially was like a big roadblock if
you<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.899> roadblock<00:01:52.310> forced<00:01:53.310> sandy

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you will and that roadblock forced sandy

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
you will and that roadblock forced sandy
to<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> left<00:01:54.750> turn<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to make a left turn and get this that

bit of a discussion about steroid use
and<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:35.230> fact<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.560> we<00:04:35.710> were<00:04:35.800> seeing<00:04:36.070> more

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
and the fact that we were seeing more

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.580 
and the fact that we were seeing more
homeruns<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:37.030> baseball<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.750> longer<00:04:38.140> homeruns

well<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:39.400> was<00:04:39.520> probably<00:04:39.760> related<00:04:40.180> to

well that was probably related to

couldn't attribute to steroids although
we<00:04:47.830> know<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.220> there<00:04:48.340> was<00:04:48.460> a<00:04:48.490> general<00:04:49.030> uptick

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
we know that there was a general uptick

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.630 
we know that there was a general uptick
in<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.900> number<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.200> her<00:04:50.410> homeruns<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.190> their
