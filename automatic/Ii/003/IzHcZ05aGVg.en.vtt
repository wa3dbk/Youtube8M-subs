 here my room or office is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.139
 a zone type because I think that week 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 that a couple of weeks without being able to stop 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.759
 to pack because it is an accumulation of 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 study and we have people record many videos 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.990
 I put everything next to the line in a 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.270
 wooden box 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.070

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.180
 The organization I like to tell everything 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.190

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.510
 people do not even think the mess is 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.269
 tidy 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 I'm very disorganized but at the same time 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.210
 organized time if you do not know me 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.850
 they understand 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.680
 but I can not do anything without the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.400
 things start in place 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 it's complicated 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.220
 now everything clean everything clean 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.010
 Look, my place is clean until 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.170
 count where they will have many videos do 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.550

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.770
 I can not do anything to anyone when 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.690
