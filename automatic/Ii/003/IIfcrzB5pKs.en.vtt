00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this is actually a real-life thing most

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
this is actually a real-life thing most
the<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> center's<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.189> gonna<00:00:23.400> call<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
right but they use code words so this is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.049 
right but they use code words so this is
something<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.650> teams<00:00:32.130> use<00:00:32.399> their<00:00:32.610> life<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
something that teams use their life I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.880 
something that teams use their life I
mean<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.870> used<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.230> use<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.680> grade

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
