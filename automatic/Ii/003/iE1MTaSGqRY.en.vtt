real blood the reason why blood is in
the<00:02:07.290> name<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.920> these<00:02:08.429> ingredients

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the name is because these ingredients

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150

within it are oxygen rich and it kind of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.910 
within it are oxygen rich and it kind of
mimics<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.580> blood<00:02:11.849> does<00:02:12.120> for

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
mimics what blood does for

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.800 
mimics what blood does for
your<00:02:13.010> body<00:02:13.250> blood<00:02:13.849> brings<00:02:14.090> oxygen<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
your body blood brings oxygen to the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.449 
your body blood brings oxygen to the
skin<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.380> looks<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.709> lot<00:02:15.830> more<00:02:15.890> vibrant

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
circulatory system okay and the reason

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.520 
circulatory system okay and the reason
why<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> love<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.599> one<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
why I love this one is that it is a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.040 
why I love this one is that it is a
serum<00:02:22.069> serums<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:22.790> usually<00:02:23.180> water-based<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
serum serums are usually water-based so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.540 
serum serums are usually water-based so
that<00:02:24.200> means<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.620> they<00:02:24.709> absorb<00:02:24.830> within<00:02:25.400> your

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
that means that they absorb within your

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.520 
that means that they absorb within your
skin<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.849> lot<00:02:26.090> more<00:02:26.209> quickly<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.690> thus<00:02:27.260> you're

seeing<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.800> benefits<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.250> lot<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.489> quickly

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
seeing the benefits a lot more quickly

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.600 
seeing the benefits a lot more quickly
too<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:30.020> mean<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.739> remember<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> put<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.550> on
