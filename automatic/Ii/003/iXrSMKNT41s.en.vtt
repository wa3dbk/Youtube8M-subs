00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello everyone 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.879
 wonderful design m rich 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.899
 who are her previous period winner 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:19.050
 and i will show you how to do it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.970
 claim his rights 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.359
 it's just a great design for her 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.539
 which are very 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.919
 will help you 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.960
 so what exactly does he do 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 we need two cents 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 we need no cut off price 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760
 but let's attack 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.370
 we have 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.980
 full review 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.640
 no polish blocking people 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 m 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 all you need to do is just jump out 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.080
 to withdraw 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.180
 very simple and now i'm his quick 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.620
 built in the first place is stuffy for us that's all that 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.970
 we need to identify and inventory 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 except perhaps the top five 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 perspectives so we set first 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100
 three blocks 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.080
 it can be done and warmer and where 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.980
 please how it went like 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.890
 here it is four blocks tall here 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.890
 us 2 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.650
 but now we have to put a blog 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.020
 something like cutting juice okay bye 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 use the lantern 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 KSC parking lot is high here I will use 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.080
 by flight 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.170
 but he doesn't have to do this 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 so here we are in the camp of the court 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 a pack of ships 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 start court button 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.119
 and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.039
 and etc 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.620
 on whatsoever 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 maximum rush start peak 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.769
 everything seems to us and now we need 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.329
 caught in response on the bus 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.029
 honestly not standing 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.649
 ordinary simpler 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.679
 on ourselves now we are digging 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.989
 the warehouse is more precisely three blocks there 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.549
 Here is such a way that something like 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.859
 ladders 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.239
 and we go down there 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.779
 before this game 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.189
 such a story 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.629
 but in principle this one has two ways or 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.869
 beer and push the button and immediately become 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.869
 block and then we blog himself 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.489
 same view 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.379
 seen from above 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.459
 bottom n nothing ends 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.339
 just great comfortable 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.159
 and so thank you all 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.289
 yes soon meetings
