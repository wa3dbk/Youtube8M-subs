00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.029
 this week so I'm looking forward to belfeld 4 for my parents and school 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.270
 and I just go the mountain that you play better 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.420
 I already talked to you and we everything it works exactly and how it works 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.420
 because it is of course a very big difference with battlefield 3 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.570
 if you ate and i say pryor anything then you can just be very standard 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.589
 players like the rycke support and is now a swelling after all standard weapons 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.869
 and you can customize a few things, but that is really very whole 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.570
 little because it is so fat that you go to customize and old right mouse button 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.740
 will change in the free days 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.640
 it is not very special but it is nicely done 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.890
 and you can for example the only buy different and organ is on say I can only 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.510
 Ensure that the le site is on it or not 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.330
 well know the second later in life can also be out 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.900
 and what if super fat vs is that if you are in a squad and we just go one 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.720
 just by 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.130
 by the score 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.350
 then you see so 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.720
 that you as katie very nicely click the folder that runs next to then you will immediately see 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.110
 in touch 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.380
 11 go to see what he sees 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.750
 and that is super cool look that none of this is going to put on 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.970
 an ordinary one 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.970
 maybe we should be able to help 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.480
 later immediately do everything that shows what happens if you have a name 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 talpa immediately a guy 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.590
 almost 2 already 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 he had reilly the cinema arrived and switch between the whole button 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.730
 pressure that goes down 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.020
 super fat and you can also not get through a ship with the malware 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.530
 I have seen that the break was broken 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.510
 yes how exactly it breaks I have no idea maybe I am in the Netherlands 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 to be 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.980
 helmond that is also a difference 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.220
 at least what happens again 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.070
 and that will take place 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.990
 and very often viewers sit there during the day 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.410
 Hey 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.170
 Valdes you actually do the Dutch 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.720
 and there it goes potatoes with a first time second but that is 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.950
 and he has been doing his feet for years now 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.700
 is that, by the way, I don't have fifty new ones 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.510
 also deflation 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.040
 I worked hard 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.740
 enter the mesh side 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.989
 I've played with this folder a few times now three or four times and and I could 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.120
 so only it is very often that those people are already on top of dax at the campsite 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.260
 I immediately do not know if that is the case, yes that is also the case 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.290
 It is difficult to go there but once you are fat is too 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.329
 forging 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.239
 it's one and the location 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.319
 no i can prevent it 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.649
 for a new playing date 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.969
 and just see what also knew a difference or after what I really care about 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:36.819
 had to get used to it 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.419
 is that if you also click here nice brands and the citizen that was with 3 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.929
 and now with three hours in between and in the Netherlands 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:49.069
 the style starts, however, I will that the COCO 83 has been anouk for a while 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:51.569
 jeanette 5 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.869
 35 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.869
 but that also my first time on 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.889
 all with 2 0 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.159
 so knowing that is equally different 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.949
 I'll give it a try 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.640
 I have the movie food at five 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.059
 falcon in the house 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:08.349
 boredom 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.440
 always calling yes i'm the air for epe 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.989
 alarming 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.989
 he actually knew I all felt lure 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.599
 so I give the ecb if you stand out well 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.249
 someone who percent 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.639
 from already longer but the first at the first measurement adultery 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.689
 is that bad it is really very fat 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.830
 that is really super super super super became 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.909
 but that makes sense 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.729
 the image of the lap cast 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.349
 it was about good 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.099
 people who crack 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.639
 I do not think I do not know exactly what I think on the one hand I think it is 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.659
 word fat 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.349
 on the other hand, it also disappoints me a bit 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.709
 yes I have the feeling that it all goes a bit slow 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.949
 I have a lot of problems with merck. I am going to merge burka 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.519
 that's just because everyone wants to play and so are the service 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.139
 not 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.249
 whole country that apparently works 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.249
 and the oil is not childish 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.649
 oh well I still have plenty of hoppa 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:16.139
 was nice, however, escort ladies go after them 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.749
 conduct the study 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:20.349
 build up 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.419
 well 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.729
 a driver of a van never welcome the Dutch 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.400
 also takes place 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.059
 pointed poisonous 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:31.069
 when he gets out 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.879
 apparently had been taken in the park 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.379
 coach lies 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.590
 opare about it 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.300
 the rest yes I think the real game has already been several times 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.300
 of the rms today i don't know what i think 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:45.910
 the Institute 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.240
 nobody seems so 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 go and try 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.490
 we are going to try it out night away 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.129
 dpa afp adv 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.360
 9 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.499
 if you have 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.409
 nijkerk 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.589
 old hand 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.490
 I now wait for twelve goals 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.839
 chet hiding behind a car 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.020
 the hand 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.550
 he had kept 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 what are left behind 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.150
 4 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.169
 then go before 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.370
 just a package 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.379
 George Clarke 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.800
 it just worked 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.750
 he is then I still want to come out on the roof sometime me 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.919
 hope so 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.690
 it's just yes I know so what is the caretaker actually brought 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.210
 grandpa still spurs 0 always but maybe 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:41.019
 it adorns this is just a very very good thing to my surprise 27 

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:43.749
 become your own strength 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.749
 only it is it is a bit different with 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.309
 with year with customizing and 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.999
 a power failure 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:56.239
 2 I think that was expected for me a certain one had rolled up too 

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.629
 five were big expensive that it is a bit clear 4 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.300
 and 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.839
 you saw with 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.979
 saw gt year eaten and the fact that a super way too often off 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.189
 that's in a lot 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.189
 people come so you produce 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.559
 so don't get out of it 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.899
 with the old-fashioned apart portsmouth which I sometimes say last 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.389
 will saw the light was I also you many people reported sick 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.950
 and before the guild, that is of course much less for a better year 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.020
 it has not been communicated yet with gt year five though and I noticed that 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.830
 also on twitter was something to moan are now with a the belfry movie 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.719
 naturally makes you shine much more popular apparently 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.669
 but still held a mountain the first three has always been my my thing your book 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.070
 a lot of live comes from doing the project 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.319
 I certainly also go through midfield 4 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.080
 I hope you enjoyed the movie that it was much better 4 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.240
 turned on and who knows maybe someday we will play the church hall thereby green roofs 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.159
 found capabilities to bold video through with your friends 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.749
 And don't forget the Almere and I'll see you next time
