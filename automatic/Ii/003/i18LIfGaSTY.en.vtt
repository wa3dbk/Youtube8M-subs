be made extremely complicated if we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
be made extremely complicated if we
wanted<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.630> gonna<00:00:27.720> answer

these questions as concisely and to the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
these questions as concisely and to the
point<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> let's<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.030> started<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
point as I can so let's get started so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.170 
point as I can so let's get started so
what<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> intermittent<00:00:34.500> fasting<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:35.180> but

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
what is intermittent fasting well but

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
what is intermittent fasting well but
it's<00:00:36.300> simply<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> if'<00:00:37.079> protocol<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's simply the if' protocol is a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
it's simply the if' protocol is a
dietary<00:00:38.460> structure<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> alternates

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
dietary structure that alternates

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.690 
dietary structure that alternates
between<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:40.230> extended<00:00:40.620> period<00:00:40.860> where<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.430> food

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
between an extended period where no food

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
between an extended period where no food
is<00:00:41.820> consumed<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.420> usually<00:00:42.800> 16<00:00:43.800> hours<00:00:44.190> or

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is consumed at all usually 16 hours or

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090 
is consumed at all usually 16 hours or
more<00:00:44.579> followed<00:00:45.390> by<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> feeding<00:00:46.230> window<00:00:46.590> where

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
more followed by a feeding window where

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
more followed by a feeding window where
all<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.520> daily<00:00:47.700> calories<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.450> consumed

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
all of your daily calories are consumed

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
all of your daily calories are consumed
so<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.950> no<00:00:50.100> single<00:00:50.520> intermittent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so there's no single intermittent

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.930 
so there's no single intermittent
fasting<00:00:51.420> structure<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.860> fasting<00:00:53.730> and

fasting structure and the fasting and
non<00:00:54.270> fast-food<00:00:54.750> periods<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.230> vary<00:00:55.440> quite<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
non fast-food periods can vary quite a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
non fast-food periods can vary quite a

certainly<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> viable<00:01:21.770> nutritional<00:01:22.770> approach

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
certainly a viable nutritional approach

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
certainly a viable nutritional approach

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
fasting approach well the answer here is

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.180 
fasting approach well the answer here is
also<00:03:15.720> pretty<00:03:15.959> simple<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.920> for

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
also pretty simple and that is that for

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.099 
also pretty simple and that is that for
many<00:03:17.400> people<00:03:17.489> an<00:03:18.060> intermittent<00:03:18.930> fasting

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
many people an intermittent fasting

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.170 
many people an intermittent fasting
approach<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.799> an<00:03:19.920> easier<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.519> follow<00:03:20.730> method

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
approach is an easier to follow method

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300

time again long-term fat loss is

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.309 
time again long-term fat loss is
