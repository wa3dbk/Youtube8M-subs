 we want 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.829
 is also important about 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.789
 six or eight centimeters in length 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.259
 is an athlete of potential in terms of value was very powerful in the retina 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.989
 resident in the form of rainwater 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.819
 and are neither concentrated on the edge 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.149
 if you look at that if you're going to have a redemption mycosis addresses well 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.310
 financially 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.810
 the action would be to let these do not need them 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.660
 penetration all over the world including being associated with 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.650
 correct neiro a flood took a bridge and killing six people 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.399
 but the flood that caused the tragedy also in the events police of the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.350
 land in the municipality of dona francisca where others had already been found 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.180
 countries scanning the pages with attentive eyes the paleontologist Sergio 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.510
 saw that it was revealed by the waters 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.780
 from this time for all 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.550
 and from here we start digging 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.080
 another advantage is that they have been discovering the entire skeleton that has been protected 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.340
 by high plaster of the laboratory a brief explanation shows how 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.500
 place and full of treasures 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.280
 also on Thursday the organ the wound 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 of one of a rib 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.910
 that's what belonged 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 when being sought that lived here 238 million years 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.520
 asked about life in time that transit until later 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.440
 I also asked the year 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.310
 by the way we do not stay here as the squire is like an act of rome 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.370
 a kind of armor in the spine 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.890
 protection as to the measures of the enemies he tried to keep them was 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.020
 from a packet to people just ahead of us even greater advances 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.800
 possession, because the artist was here, there is no 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 250 million years 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.400
 so far had only the maximum number of fire 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.450
 I do not know not in the center of it where today is Brazil there was a huge desert 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.590
 greater than any that ever existed 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.930
 how many continent began to be barred the climate drastically changed the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.069
 South of Brazil has become the most suitable place for animal life 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.719
 the 238 million years in the Triassic period with this agreement before the 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.029
 migrating in this region he fed one of the herds of 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:35.979
 herbivores 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:40.619
 I do not want punishment the dinosaurs have spread all over territory that came 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:45.079
 to become Brazil the ground literally trembled when the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.909
 they all passed the titanosaur was more than 14 meters long all 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.299
 most feared carnivore of the season 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.790
 meirelles who saved us after the triassic was all covered by a 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.819
 large layer of volcanic rock but needed no one took over the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.290
 merely a shop total sales of the GM in the models will be the beneficiaries - 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.229
 is proof of society's knowledge in the oldest hall of the 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.139
 world 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.709
 the same resource brasilia - Brazil is the country of all others in the balance 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.129
 when he meant the southern cruise he was small the size of a 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.999
 dog 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.369
 his favorite prey was a health risk and fed himself bands show 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.359
 was common in the region 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.439
 as the authors say 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.369
 here in this acute sense a few kilometers from the other was found a 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:40.759
 rarity 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.620
 but if you dilma 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.379
 made with nine puppies all probably reserved by the landslide 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.409
 that the nardoni 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.819
 there are several places here in the region 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.480
 in which the lows of the triassic period the lighthouse and each place has 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.010
 different characteristics of both the geological formation and the type of 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.349
 fossils found in this one for example predominate the phases of teaching 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.540
 ball tite senator said tooth of car and it is precisely in that invertebrate 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.310
 which already had characteristics later found of mammals 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:19.429
 the cynodonts had a much larger brain than the animals of the same party 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.880
 scientists believe they were already warm-blooded animals 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.559
 but it was still missing once 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.700
 lucia national of rio de janeiro 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.509
 every discovery is received with enthusiasm 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.889
 is certain that the identity of the nation is being erected 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.249
 wonderful posts with lots of information having been discovered in the 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.050
 over the last ten years 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.750
 and this leads us to believe that if the surveys were intensified as each 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.689
 because your number 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.479
 is that of the affected Gauchos had faced amid the excavations but 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.949
 if the teacher specifies this reason the search 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.700
 when you feel like you're going to be when you grow up 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.560
 talking about Brazil will need these talents and a lot of investments to 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.910
 reveal what harbored prehistory
