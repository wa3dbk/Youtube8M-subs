to get the defense off the ground and
then<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.579> reverse<00:01:33.210> pivot<00:01:33.680> almost<00:01:34.700> 360

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
then you do a reverse pivot almost 360

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.819 
then you do a reverse pivot almost 360
degrees<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.540> yourself<00:01:36.930> into<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.530> paint

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so that you can shoot a leaner so let's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
so that you can shoot a leaner so let's
walk<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.930> move<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.100> attack<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
walk through this move as you attack to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.230 
walk through this move as you attack to
the<00:01:44.939> paint<00:01:45.329> or<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> 15-foot<00:01:47.250> area<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the paint or to the 15-foot area you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.319 
the paint or to the 15-foot area you
have<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.600> stop<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> give<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> good<00:01:50.520> shot<00:01:51.000> fake

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
have to stop and give a good shot fake

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
have to stop and give a good shot fake
but<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.229> need<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> stay<00:01:52.770> balanced<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
but you need to stay balanced here and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
but you need to stay balanced here and
you<00:01:53.939> need<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> stay<00:01:54.420> low<00:01:54.450> enough<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.590> can

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you need to stay low enough so you can

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.060 
you need to stay low enough so you can
quickly<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.780> reverse<00:01:58.140> pivot<00:01:58.469> then

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
quickly get into that reverse pivot then

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.100 
quickly get into that reverse pivot then
after<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> pivot<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.689> collect

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
after that pivot you have to collect

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889 
after that pivot you have to collect
yourself<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.149> maintain

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
yourself so that you can maintain

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.700 
yourself so that you can maintain
control<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.579> off<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:06.030> shot

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
control so you can get off a good shot

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.249 
control so you can get off a good shot
this<00:02:07.710> next<00:02:08.190> move<00:02:08.429> actually<00:02:09.270> starts<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:10.020> with

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
this next move actually starts out with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
this next move actually starts out with
the<00:02:10.410> prior<00:02:10.679> move<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.640> you're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the prior move so you're going to do the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.460 
the prior move so you're going to do the
shot<00:02:12.660> fake

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
shot fake

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100 
shot fake
and<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> reverse<00:02:15.270> pivot<00:02:15.570> but

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and you're going to reverse pivot but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
and you're going to reverse pivot but
then<00:02:16.290> you're<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> add<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:17.400> wrinkle<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
then you're going to add one wrinkle so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.060 
then you're going to add one wrinkle so
after<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.750> reverse<00:02:19.080> pivot<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:19.620> here

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
after that reverse pivot right here

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.010 
after that reverse pivot right here
instead<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.700> shooting<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.780> actually

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
instead of shooting you're actually

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.940 
instead of shooting you're actually
going<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> come<00:02:22.410> back<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.220> shoot<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> fadeaway

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
going to come back and shoot a fadeaway

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.620 
going to come back and shoot a fadeaway
so<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.250> mentioned<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.820> move<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.270> similar

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
so as I mentioned this move is similar

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.110 
so as I mentioned this move is similar
to<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.960> prior<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.220> want<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.490> stay<00:02:29.820> low

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
to the prior one you want to stay low

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
to the prior one you want to stay low
you<00:02:30.990> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> do<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> reverse<00:02:31.860> pivot<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you want to do the reverse pivot and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300 
you want to do the reverse pivot and
sell<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.230> when<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.380> sell<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.920> should

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
sell it and when you sell it you should

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.820 
sell it and when you sell it you should
force<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.940> defense<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.350> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
force the defense to back up and then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
force the defense to back up and then
when<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.100> forward<00:02:38.610> pivot<00:02:39.090> back<00:02:39.270> out<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
when you forward pivot back out of it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.260 
when you forward pivot back out of it
you<00:02:40.470> should<00:02:40.530> create<00:02:41.070> enough<00:02:41.160> space<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:42.090> be

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you should create enough space to be

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.960 
you should create enough space to be
able<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.660> your<00:02:42.750> shot<00:02:43.050> on<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.580> next<00:02:44.820> move

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
able to get your shot on the next move

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.090 
able to get your shot on the next move
is<00:02:45.060> another<00:02:45.450> counter<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> high<00:02:46.800> head

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
is another counter this is the high head

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
is another counter this is the high head
fake<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.640> pull<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.710> will<00:02:50.010> attack<00:02:50.490> to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
fake and pull up so you will attack to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
fake and pull up so you will attack to
the<00:02:51.240> mid-range<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.620> you're<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.890> to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the mid-range just like you're going to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.530 
the mid-range just like you're going to
pull<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:53.880> going<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> very

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
pull up and you're going to do a very

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.560 
pull up and you're going to do a very
high<00:02:54.930> head<00:02:55.530> fake<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.550> should<00:02:57.000> force<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
high head fake this should force the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.930 
high head fake this should force the
defender<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.020> jump<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.680> leave<00:02:59.490> his<00:02:59.640> feet<00:02:59.820> and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
defender to jump and leave his feet and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.420 
defender to jump and leave his feet and
go<00:03:00.060> by<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.780> jump<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.470> allow<00:03:01.680> himself<00:03:01.890> open

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
go by you or jump and allow himself open

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.570 
go by you or jump and allow himself open
for<00:03:02.640> contact<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.990> key<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.620> move<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
for contact the key to this move is to

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.820 
for contact the key to this move is to
not<00:03:05.850> let<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.300> feet<00:03:06.540> come<00:03:06.570> off<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.170> ground<00:03:07.470> so

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
not let your feet come off the ground so

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.600 
not let your feet come off the ground so
that<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.010> don't<00:03:08.220> travel<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:11.100> those<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
that you don't travel so those are the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.850 
that you don't travel so those are the
four<00:03:11.880> moves<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.540> they<00:03:13.140> work<00:03:13.350> well<00:03:13.620> as

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
four moves and they work well as

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.320 
four moves and they work well as
counters<00:03:14.340> for<00:03:14.490> each<00:03:14.640> other<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.060> you're<00:03:15.210> able

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
counters for each other if you're able

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880 
counters for each other if you're able
to<00:03:15.570> hit<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> pull-up<00:03:16.110> jumper<00:03:16.590> you're<00:03:16.770> going

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
to hit the pull-up jumper you're going

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.130 
to hit the pull-up jumper you're going
to<00:03:16.950> set<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.370> these<00:03:17.520> other<00:03:17.790> moves<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
to set up these other moves and the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.720 
to set up these other moves and the
other<00:03:19.260> great<00:03:19.440> thing<00:03:19.500> about<00:03:19.709> these<00:03:20.070> moves<00:03:20.400> is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
other great thing about these moves is

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.699 
other great thing about these moves is
you<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> pivot<00:03:21.989> foot<00:03:22.200> you're<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you have a pivot foot you're in the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.800 
you have a pivot foot you're in the
paint<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.400> should<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.850> able<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.209> maintain

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
paint and you should be able to maintain

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.350 
paint and you should be able to maintain
composure<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.070> pass<00:03:26.370> out<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.150> you're

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
composure and pass out of it if you're

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.660 
composure and pass out of it if you're
stuck
