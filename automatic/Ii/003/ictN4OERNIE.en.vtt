okay perfect right here look at it it's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
okay perfect right here look at it it's
got<00:01:21.180> Plan<00:01:21.570> B<00:01:21.750> cyanides<00:01:22.259> potager<00:01:23.009> provided

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
got Plan B cyanides potager provided

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.219 
got Plan B cyanides potager provided
that<00:01:23.909> means<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> lighter<00:01:24.930> thinner
