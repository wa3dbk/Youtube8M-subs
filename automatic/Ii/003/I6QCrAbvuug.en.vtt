00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
still that light will go off and then

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.210 
still that light will go off and then
it'll<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.810> active<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.350> ready<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> take<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
it'll be active and ready to take a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.160 
it'll be active and ready to take a
picture<00:02:41.610> or<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> film<00:02:42.390> clip<00:02:42.570> some<00:02:42.930> clips

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
picture or a film clip some clips

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.490 
picture or a film clip some clips
they're<00:02:43.350> 30<00:02:43.530> seconds<00:02:43.950> long<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.410> it's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
they're 30 seconds long and I think it's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.850 
they're 30 seconds long and I think it's
ready<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.780> probably<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.470> took<00:02:49.620> one

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
ready now so it probably just took one

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.670 
ready now so it probably just took one
and<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.720> already<00:02:51.810> had<00:02:52.050> one<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.350> there<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.590> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
and I already had one on there and you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.660 
and I already had one on there and you
can<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.100> up<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.610> believe

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
can see it's up to two now and I believe

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.850 
can see it's up to two now and I believe
it's<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.150> video<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.350> I'm<00:02:58.500> videoing

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it's on video right now so I'm videoing

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.930 
it's on video right now so I'm videoing
myself<00:02:59.370> taking<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:00.560> okay<00:03:02.030> now<00:03:03.030> set<00:03:04.940> what

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
myself taking this okay now set what

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
myself taking this okay now set what
really<00:03:06.120> matters<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.690> what<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> pictures

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
really matters is what do the pictures

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.950 
really matters is what do the pictures
and<00:03:08.220> film<00:03:08.550> clips<00:03:08.850> look<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.630> I'm<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
and film clips look like so I'm going to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.660 
and film clips look like so I'm going to
show<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:13.380> that's<00:03:14.130> how<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.340> turn<00:03:14.550> it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
show you that and that's how you turn it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.110 
show you that and that's how you turn it
off<00:03:14.790> by<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.030> way<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.720> hold<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.990> button<00:03:16.140> down

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
off by the way just hold the button down

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.060 
off by the way just hold the button down
remember<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> sensors<00:03:18.990> sense<00:03:19.500> heat<00:03:19.890> and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
remember that the sensors sense heat and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.740 
remember that the sensors sense heat and
motion<00:03:20.400> at<00:03:20.520> about<00:03:20.730> forty<00:03:21.060> feet<00:03:21.210> away<00:03:21.270> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
motion at about forty feet away and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.350 
motion at about forty feet away and
there's<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.680> 15-second<00:03:23.460> delay<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.970> whatever<00:03:24.270> is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
there's a 15-second delay so whatever is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.930 
there's a 15-second delay so whatever is
captured<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.870> film<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.410> 15<00:03:25.980> seconds<00:03:26.370> after

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
captured on film is 15 seconds after

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.050 
captured on film is 15 seconds after

small 8 foot in diameter clearing I had

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.970

are illuminated the animal is still in
darkness<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.830> seems<00:04:23.460> totally<00:04:23.849> unaware<00:04:24.090> of

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.660 

I've<00:04:30.930> found<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.440> at<00:04:31.710> about<00:04:31.950> fifteen<00:04:32.550> to

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
I've found that at about fifteen to

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.130 
I've found that at about fifteen to
twenty<00:04:32.700> feet<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.450> best<00:04:33.660> range<00:04:33.930> for

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
twenty feet is the best range for

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.470 
twenty feet is the best range for
nighttime<00:04:34.320> video<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.580> as<00:04:35.730> animals<00:04:36.300> get

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
nighttime video and that as animals get

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.720 
nighttime video and that as animals get
closer<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.200> camera<00:04:37.410> they<00:04:37.770> sometimes<00:04:38.400> get

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
closer to the camera they sometimes get

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.530 
closer to the camera they sometimes get
too<00:04:38.910> bright

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
too bright

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.960 
too bright

that comes out of range for the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.100 
that comes out of range for the
illumination<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:56.160> detect<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.730> or<00:04:57.570> properly

worked fine there were a few incidences
where<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:51.750> caught<00:05:52.140> just<00:05:52.530> movement<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:53.100> brush

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400

but this was very rare and it was

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.350 
but this was very rare and it was
because<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.520> lot<00:05:56.700> of<00:05:56.850> movement<00:05:57.180> as<00:05:57.240> you

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
because of a lot of movement as you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.110 
because of a lot of movement as you
could<00:05:57.510> see<00:05:57.660> in<00:05:57.750> this<00:05:57.870> video<00:05:58.170> clip<00:05:58.880> in<00:05:59.880> most
