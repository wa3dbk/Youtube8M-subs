I've had it for years for a anyways for
a<00:01:28.560> fish<00:01:28.830> tank<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.250> something<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.760> like<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
a fish tank or something it's like the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
a fish tank or something it's like the
stuff<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> put<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.830> bottom<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.790> sex<00:01:33.150> with

stuff you put in the bottom and sex with

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.740 
stuff you put in the bottom and sex with
I<00:01:33.420> crushed<00:01:33.830> glass<00:01:34.830> they<00:01:35.460> call<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> black<00:01:36.390> sand

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I crushed glass they call it black sand

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
I crushed glass they call it black sand
but<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.080> think<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.410> crushed<00:01:37.680> glass<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but I think it's crushed glass it's a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.640 
but I think it's crushed glass it's a
little<00:01:38.580> shiny<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.720> after<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.020> paint<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
little shiny but after I paint it with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.180 
little shiny but after I paint it with
the<00:01:41.780> flat<00:01:42.780> black<00:01:43.050> paint<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.620> actually<00:01:43.980> comes

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
the flat black paint it actually comes

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.060 
the flat black paint it actually comes
out<00:01:44.420> looking<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:45.450> darn<00:01:45.870> good<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.770> that's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
out looking pretty darn good so that's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.190 
out looking pretty darn good so that's
what<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> use

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.810 

put<00:01:54.200> them<00:01:54.409> in<00:01:54.440> my<00:01:54.560> hands

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.860 

and<00:02:00.330> then<00:02:00.480> I<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.840> um<00:02:01.610> put<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.640> over<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> top

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:15.020 

use<00:02:06.870> quite<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.470> it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.510 

sprinkle<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.120> all<00:02:16.240> over<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:18.160> gets<00:02:18.280> all

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
sprinkle it all over it so it gets all

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:30.059 
sprinkle it all over it so it gets all
over<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:19.000> blue<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.870> everything

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.309 

and<00:02:30.489> I'm<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:30.819> gonna<00:02:31.000> dump<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.450> excess<00:02:31.569> off<00:02:32.049> a

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
and I'm just gonna dump the excess off a

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.399 
and I'm just gonna dump the excess off a
little<00:02:32.469> bit<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.930> we're<00:02:35.079> gonna<00:02:35.140> let<00:02:35.409> that<00:02:35.439> dry

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
little bit and we're gonna let that dry

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.140 
little bit and we're gonna let that dry
you<00:02:38.409> can<00:02:38.469> see<00:02:38.769> it's<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.189> you<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.879> see<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you can see it's got you can see the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.880 
you can see it's got you can see the
white<00:02:40.329> blue<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.599> under<00:02:41.170> there<00:02:41.319> but<00:02:41.500> it'll<00:02:41.650> dry

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
white blue and under there but it'll dry

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.830 
white blue and under there but it'll dry
clear<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.969> you<00:02:43.060> won't<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.299> able<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.480> see<00:02:43.719> it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
clear and you won't be able to see it

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.140 
clear and you won't be able to see it
and<00:02:44.439> then<00:02:44.739> after<00:02:45.219> this<00:02:45.340> dries<00:02:45.609> good<00:02:45.969> we're

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and then after this dries good we're

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.280 
and then after this dries good we're
going<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.329> come<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.079> more<00:02:47.109> step

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
going to come back with one more step

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.970 
going to come back with one more step
and<00:02:48.780> I'll<00:02:49.780> show<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.019> how<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.290> works<00:02:50.560> after

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and I'll show you how that works after

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.319 
and I'll show you how that works after
this<00:02:51.129> dries<00:02:53.099> okay<00:02:54.099> so<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.489> glue<00:02:54.730> has<00:02:55.030> pretty

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
this dries okay so the glue has pretty

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.699 
this dries okay so the glue has pretty
much<00:02:55.540> dried<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:58.659> here<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.139> you<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.530> it's

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
much dried on here and you can see it's

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.429 
much dried on here and you can see it's
pretty<00:03:02.709> solid<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:04.209> then<00:03:04.420> we're<00:03:05.109> going<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> add

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
pretty solid and then we're going to add

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.539 
pretty solid and then we're going to add
just<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:06.579> little<00:03:06.819> bit<00:03:06.939> more<00:03:07.150> coal<00:03:08.079> on<00:03:08.319> top<00:03:08.620> just

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
just a little bit more coal on top just

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.539 
just a little bit more coal on top just
to<00:03:10.470> kind<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.709> rid<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:15.430> a

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
to kind of get rid of the how it's a

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.860 
to kind of get rid of the how it's a
brute<00:03:15.849> you<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.239> just<00:03:16.299> kind<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.689> comes

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
brute you know it just kind of comes

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.479 
brute you know it just kind of comes
down<00:03:16.959> abruptly<00:03:17.409> on<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.859> sides<00:03:18.099> we're<00:03:18.370> going

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
down abruptly on the sides we're going

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.890 
down abruptly on the sides we're going
to<00:03:18.549> try<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> smooth<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.870> little

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
to try to smooth that out just a little

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.449 
to try to smooth that out just a little
bit<00:03:20.290> by<00:03:21.189> adding<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.549> little<00:03:21.730> bit<00:03:21.819> more<00:03:23.430> coal<00:03:24.430> to

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
bit by adding a little bit more coal to

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.240 
bit by adding a little bit more coal to
the<00:03:24.730> sides<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.620> I'll<00:03:26.620> show<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:26.889> how<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:27.099> did

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the sides and I'll show you how I did

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.379 
the sides and I'll show you how I did
that<00:03:27.689> so<00:03:28.689> I'm<00:03:28.750> going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.959> take<00:03:30.269> basically<00:03:31.269> I'm

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
that so I'm going to take basically I'm

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.199 
that so I'm going to take basically I'm
going<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.599> take<00:03:32.489> I'm<00:03:33.489> just<00:03:33.549> going<00:03:33.879> to<00:03:33.939> grab<00:03:34.180> a

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
going to take I'm just going to grab a

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.490 
going to take I'm just going to grab a
bunch<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.780> same<00:03:35.500> cut<00:03:36.280> glass<00:03:37.169> and<00:03:38.169> I'm

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
bunch of this same cut glass and I'm

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.520 
bunch of this same cut glass and I'm
going<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.739> put<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.549> top

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:57.600 

mainly<00:03:46.280> on<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.520> sides

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.120 

so<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.210> looks<00:03:58.360> pretty<00:03:58.630> good<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.920> I'm<00:04:00.040> gonna

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
going to help my glue solution I have

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.330 
going to help my glue solution I have
another<00:04:18.180> same<00:04:19.180> wood<00:04:19.420> glue<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.680> um<00:04:20.920> added

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
another same wood glue I just um added

another same wood glue I just um added
some<00:04:21.370> water<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.060> thin<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.360> out<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.530> I'm

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
some water to it to thin it out and I'm

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.740 
some water to it to thin it out and I'm
just<00:04:23.860> gonna<00:04:24.040> put<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:25.770> through<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.600> it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
just gonna put that through it so it

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.920 
just gonna put that through it so it
kind<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.220> soaks<00:04:30.220> down<00:04:30.460> through<00:04:30.760> there

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.360 

and<00:04:37.470> make<00:04:37.710> sure<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.949> get<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.190> nice<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.639> covered

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.280 

and<00:04:46.090> now<00:04:47.090> we<00:04:47.150> got<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.480> let<00:04:47.600> this<00:04:47.750> dry<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.050> this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
and now we got to let this dry and this

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.720 
and now we got to let this dry and this
is<00:04:48.440> going<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.620> take<00:04:48.830> quite<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.130> bit<00:04:49.250> longer<00:04:49.310> to

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
is going to take quite a bit longer to

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.350 
is going to take quite a bit longer to
dry<00:04:49.940> because<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:50.900> so<00:04:51.110> damp<00:04:52.030> but<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.210> can

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
dry because it is so damp but you can

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.730 
dry because it is so damp but you can
see<00:04:53.830> how<00:04:54.830> late<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.960> just<00:04:57.139> kind<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.380> rounds

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
see how late on it just kind of rounds

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.010 
see how late on it just kind of rounds
that<00:04:57.830> off<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.100> little<00:04:58.370> better<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.699> think<00:04:59.020> and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
that off a little better I think and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.610 
that off a little better I think and
makes<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.560> look<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:02.210> little<00:05:02.720> more<00:05:02.870> realistic

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
makes it look a little more realistic

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.450 
makes it look a little more realistic
and<00:05:03.889> then<00:05:04.699> as<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:05.030> dries<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:07.040> whiteness

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
and then as it dries this the whiteness

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.330 
and then as it dries this the whiteness
that<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.760> see<00:05:07.940> in<00:05:08.060> there<00:05:08.210> will<00:05:08.449> go<00:05:08.630> away<00:05:08.750> and

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
that you see in there will go away and

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.310 
that you see in there will go away and
plus<00:05:10.340> by<00:05:10.550> time<00:05:10.790> we're<00:05:10.940> done<00:05:11.169> we're<00:05:12.169> going<00:05:12.260> to

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
plus by time we're done we're going to

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.110 
plus by time we're done we're going to
spray<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:12.919> one<00:05:13.130> more<00:05:13.280> time<00:05:13.460> with<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:13.880> flat

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
spray it one more time with the flat

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.550 
spray it one more time with the flat
paint<00:05:15.460> just<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.580> kind<00:05:16.790> of<00:05:16.850> finish<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.270> off<00:05:17.560> and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
paint just to kind of finish it off and

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.730 
paint just to kind of finish it off and
once<00:05:19.250> this<00:05:19.400> dries<00:05:21.130> I'll<00:05:22.130> show<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.460> that<00:05:22.700> and

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
once this dries I'll show you that and

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.280 
once this dries I'll show you that and
and<00:05:24.740> what<00:05:24.979> it<00:05:25.070> looks<00:05:25.220> like<00:05:25.370> when<00:05:25.580> it's<00:05:25.729> done

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
and what it looks like when it's done

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.719 
and what it looks like when it's done
okay<00:05:27.290> so<00:05:27.350> here<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.889> is<00:05:28.010> it's<00:05:28.250> not<00:05:28.400> them

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
okay so here it is it's not them

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.879 
okay so here it is it's not them
completely<00:05:29.330> dry<00:05:29.720> but<00:05:29.990> it's<00:05:30.410> pretty<00:05:30.680> close

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
completely dry but it's pretty close

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.909 
completely dry but it's pretty close
close<00:05:31.250> enough<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:31.700> I<00:05:31.760> can<00:05:31.970> kind<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.300> show<00:05:32.360> you

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
close enough so I can kind of show you

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.790 
close enough so I can kind of show you
what<00:05:33.919> it<00:05:34.580> looks<00:05:34.789> like<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.960> how<00:05:36.350> it<00:05:36.500> turned

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
what it looks like and and how it turned

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.510 
what it looks like and and how it turned
out<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:38.150> can<00:05:38.570> see<00:05:38.720> it's<00:05:38.870> pretty<00:05:38.990> shiny<00:05:39.520> that

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
out you can see it's pretty shiny that

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.790 
out you can see it's pretty shiny that
cut<00:05:40.760> glass<00:05:40.940> is<00:05:41.270> got<00:05:41.630> kind<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.080> shine<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.350> it<00:05:42.710> I

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
cut glass is got kind of a shine to it I

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.529 
cut glass is got kind of a shine to it I
don't<00:05:43.010> I<00:05:43.190> don't<00:05:43.340> really<00:05:43.550> think<00:05:43.699> coals<00:05:44.210> that

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
don't I don't really think coals that

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.279 
don't I don't really think coals that
shiny<00:05:44.900> so<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:47.479> next<00:05:47.750> I'm<00:05:47.900> just<00:05:47.960> going<00:05:48.229> to

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
shiny so the next I'm just going to

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.300 
shiny so the next I'm just going to
spray<00:05:48.530> with<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.850> flat<00:05:49.850> black<00:05:50.450> paint<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:51.310> let

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
spray with the flat black paint and let

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.120 
spray with the flat black paint and let
that<00:05:52.460> dry<00:05:52.760> and<00:05:52.940> that<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.479> pretty<00:05:53.780> much<00:05:53.960> is<00:05:54.229> is

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
that dry and that that pretty much is is

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.029 
that dry and that that pretty much is is
all<00:05:55.370> that's<00:05:55.520> left<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.560> here's<00:05:57.560> one<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:57.919> I

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
all that's left to it here's one that I

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.870 
all that's left to it here's one that I
did<00:05:58.070> earlier<00:05:59.349> that<00:06:00.349> I<00:06:00.380> sprayed<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.430> you<00:06:01.729> can

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
did earlier that I sprayed and you can

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.420 
did earlier that I sprayed and you can
see<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.180> difference<00:06:02.650> between<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.860> two<00:06:04.039> one's

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
see the difference between the two one's

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.029 
see the difference between the two one's
got<00:06:04.940> you<00:06:05.389> know<00:06:05.479> it's<00:06:05.630> got<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> flat<00:06:06.080> look<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.919> it

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
got you know it's got a flat look to it

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.250 
got you know it's got a flat look to it
where<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.150> other<00:06:08.270> ones<00:06:08.479> still<00:06:08.599> kind<00:06:08.930> of<00:06:09.020> shiny

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
where the other ones still kind of shiny

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.390 
where the other ones still kind of shiny
so<00:06:11.139> that's<00:06:12.139> all<00:06:12.349> that's<00:06:12.500> pretty<00:06:12.650> much<00:06:12.889> left<00:06:13.190> is

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
so that's all that's pretty much left is

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.810 
so that's all that's pretty much left is
just<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.700> spray<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.150> let<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.930> dry<00:06:15.139> and<00:06:15.470> then<00:06:15.820> put

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
just to spray it let it dry and then put

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.000 
just to spray it let it dry and then put
it<00:06:16.940> in<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.150> car<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.510> use<00:06:17.660> it<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:17.900> enjoy<00:06:18.200> it<00:06:18.229> so
