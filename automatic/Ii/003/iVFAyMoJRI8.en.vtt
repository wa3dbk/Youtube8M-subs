00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
not prove the existence of HIV I mean it

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.240 
not prove the existence of HIV I mean it
it<00:00:58.629> exists<00:01:01.019> why<00:01:02.019> do<00:01:02.080> you<00:01:02.379> believe<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.739> HIV

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
it exists why do you believe that HIV

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250 
it exists why do you believe that HIV
does<00:01:03.430> cause<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.050> sort<00:01:05.229> of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
does cause it is that sort of
