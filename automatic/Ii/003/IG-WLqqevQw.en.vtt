using i'm going to apply the foundation
shade<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> i<00:00:38.550> normally<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.969> mainly<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
shade that i normally use mainly on the

outside of my face and any areas that i

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.069 
outside of my face and any areas that i
normally<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.739> contour<00:00:44.629> then<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
normally would contour then with the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.060 
normally would contour then with the
lighter<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> place<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
lighter one I'm going to place it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:09.810 
lighter one I'm going to place it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.190 

so<00:01:10.820> same<00:01:11.030> technique<00:01:11.420> using<00:01:11.750> two<00:01:11.900> different

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
so same technique using two different

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.020 
so same technique using two different
shades<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:12.740> match<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.250> foundation<00:01:13.790> shades

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
shades that match the foundation shades

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.640 
shades that match the foundation shades
we<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.360> use<00:01:14.570> I'm<00:01:14.810> going<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.140> apply<00:01:15.260> those<00:01:15.500> in

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
we just use I'm going to apply those in

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:33.370 
we just use I'm going to apply those in
the<00:01:15.710> same<00:01:15.920> areas

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.400 

once<00:01:34.380> I've<00:01:34.530> done<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.800> I'm<00:01:34.980> going<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.340> apply<00:01:35.730> a

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
once I've done this I'm going to apply a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.600 
once I've done this I'm going to apply a
translucent<00:01:37.410> powder<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.920> over<00:01:38.130> top<00:01:38.280> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
translucent powder right over top just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.469 
translucent powder right over top just
to<00:01:38.670> blend<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.090> out

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.880 

now<00:01:46.479> one<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.869> most<00:01:47.110> important<00:01:47.500> things<00:01:47.740> to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
now one of the most important things to

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
now one of the most important things to
do<00:01:48.040> is<00:01:48.250> contouring<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.000> highlighting

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
do is contouring and highlighting

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.139 
do is contouring and highlighting
obviously<00:01:50.770> my<00:01:50.890> bone<00:01:51.100> structure<00:01:51.549> is<00:01:51.790> way

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
obviously my bone structure is way

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.749 
obviously my bone structure is way
different<00:01:52.390> than<00:01:52.570> miley<00:01:52.899> cyrus's<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.490> using

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
different than miley cyrus's but using

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.399 
different than miley cyrus's but using
contour<00:01:55.119> shadow<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.750> highlighting<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.259> can

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
contour shadow and highlighting you can

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.420 
contour shadow and highlighting you can
fake<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.680> way<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.220> face<00:01:57.399> is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
fake the way that your face is

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.999 
fake the way that your face is
structured<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.649> going<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.829> keep<00:01:59.950> looking

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
structured so I'm going to keep looking

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.950 
structured so I'm going to keep looking
