00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.140 

so<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> beginning<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.190> program<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.730> start

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
so the beginning the program we start

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.390 
so the beginning the program we start
off<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> slew<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> ideation<00:00:07.500> sketches<00:00:08.220> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
off with a slew of ideation sketches and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.270 
off with a slew of ideation sketches and
what<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.929> exploration<00:00:10.469> phase<00:00:10.950> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
what we do in this exploration phase is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580 
what we do in this exploration phase is
really<00:00:12.000> trying<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.389> flush<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:12.840> one<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
really trying to flush out one of the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.189 
really trying to flush out one of the
most<00:00:14.340> appropriate<00:00:14.730> design<00:00:15.330> elements<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
most appropriate design elements for the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.340 
most appropriate design elements for the
car<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.520> developed<00:00:17.760> three<00:00:18.270> final<00:00:18.690> design

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
car so we developed three final design

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.279 
car so we developed three final design
themes<00:00:19.680> represented<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:20.939> images

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
themes represented here in these images

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
themes represented here in these images
ultimately<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.640> da<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
ultimately we want here with with da is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.540 
ultimately we want here with with da is
this<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.720> represented<00:00:25.590> perhaps<00:00:26.070> more<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this really represented perhaps more the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480 
this really represented perhaps more the
brutal<00:00:27.330> side<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> three<00:00:28.830> design<00:00:29.130> themes

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
brutal side of the three design themes

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.400 
brutal side of the three design themes
but<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.359> were<00:00:30.630> elements<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
but but there were elements of some of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.020 
but but there were elements of some of
the<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.619> themes<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.430> influenced

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the other themes that really influenced

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.459 
the other themes that really influenced
the<00:00:33.270> final<00:00:33.719> design<00:00:35.960> every<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> guy<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the final design every more this guy is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
the final design every more this guy is
brand<00:00:37.860> new<00:00:37.980> every<00:00:38.850> single<00:00:39.149> part<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.600> design

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
brand new every single part we design

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
brand new every single part we design
reinvented<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> key<00:00:41.790> elements

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
reinvented there's a lot of key elements

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
reinvented there's a lot of key elements
which<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.200> took<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> build<00:00:44.160> expired<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.789> our

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
which we took and build expired from our

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.569 
which we took and build expired from our
heritage<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> certainly

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
heritage and there's a certainly

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020 
heritage and there's a certainly
bloodline<00:00:48.420> running<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.960> entire<00:00:49.649> car<00:00:50.030> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bloodline running to entire car we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
bloodline running to entire car we
talked<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.840> punching<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.469> quality

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
talked about this punching out quality

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.860 
talked about this punching out quality
this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.190> fist<00:00:53.640> breaking<00:00:54.090> through<00:00:54.300> glass<00:00:54.570> or

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this is fist breaking through glass or

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.590 
this is fist breaking through glass or
punching<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> wind<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> whole

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
punching through the wind and the whole

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.000 
punching through the wind and the whole
front<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.379> developed<00:00:58.530> around

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
front end was really developed around

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
front end was really developed around
this<00:00:59.219> theme<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> historic

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this theme and that's been a historic

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
this theme and that's been a historic
you<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.370> Mustang<00:01:02.820> since<00:01:03.329> day<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.229> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
you from Mustang since day one you can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.070 
you from Mustang since day one you can
see<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.220> dominant<00:01:05.640> shark<00:01:05.820> nose<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:06.900> we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
see the dominant shark nose but which we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.219 
see the dominant shark nose but which we
actually<00:01:07.619> took<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:08.040> our<00:01:08.450> 64<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.750> half<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually took from our 64 and a half and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469 
actually took from our 64 and a half and
two<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> 69<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:11.939> our<00:01:11.970> headlights

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
two and 69 you can see our headlights

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.560 
two and 69 you can see our headlights
came<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.229> forward<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
came much more forward so i have this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
came much more forward so i have this
forward-facing<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.770> nose<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
forward-facing look and our nose is very

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.149 
forward-facing look and our nose is very
proud<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.979> whole

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
proud you can see the the whole

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.010 
proud you can see the the whole
silhouette<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> new<00:01:21.750> car

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
silhouette what we did for the new car

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
silhouette what we did for the new car
basically<00:01:22.200> removed<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> entire<00:01:23.070> cabin

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
basically removed the entire cabin

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.899 
basically removed the entire cabin
reward<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> gives<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
reward so that gives you actually a

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
reward so that gives you actually a
longer<00:01:26.909> hood<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> creates<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.920> selfish

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
longer hood and creates a more selfish

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
longer hood and creates a more selfish
greenhouse<00:01:30.180> kevin<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.259> driver

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
greenhouse kevin for the for the driver

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
greenhouse kevin for the for the driver
and<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:33.090> gives<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:35.329> 6465<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and it gives you that 6465 look of the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
and it gives you that 6465 look of the
car<00:01:37.439> we're<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.579> looking<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
car we're really looking at all the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
car we're really looking at all the
design<00:01:39.689> elements<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.350> how<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:40.920> evolve

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
design elements and how we could evolve

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.870 
design elements and how we could evolve
them<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.270> send<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> new<00:01:43.290> modern<00:01:43.530> message<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> we

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
them to send a new modern message and we

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
them to send a new modern message and we
ultimately<00:01:45.030> ended<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.840> along<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> theme

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
ultimately ended up along this theme

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.880 
ultimately ended up along this theme
here<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> call<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> unified

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
here with this what we call a unified

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
here with this what we call a unified
diello<00:01:49.890> graphic<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.729> stands<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.090> daylight

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
diello graphic which stands for daylight

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.010 
diello graphic which stands for daylight
opening<00:01:52.110> ie<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.950> side<00:01:53.130> glass<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.869> once<00:01:54.869> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
opening ie the side glass and once we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
opening ie the side glass and once we
came<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.470> conclusion<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.850> helped

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
came to this conclusion it really helped

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
came to this conclusion it really helped
to<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.780> modernize<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> car<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.340> bring

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to to modernize the car and just bring

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.209 
to to modernize the car and just bring
it<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.030> new<00:02:00.810> dimension<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.710> also<00:02:01.979> helped

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it into a new dimension it also helped

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.730 
it into a new dimension it also helped
to<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:03.000> set<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.479> fastback<00:02:03.899> profile<00:02:04.439> for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
to really set up a fastback profile for

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.039 
to really set up a fastback profile for
us

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
us

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.339 
us
we<00:02:07.049> made<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> rear<00:02:07.729> track<00:02:08.729> wider<00:02:09.259> told<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
we made the rear track wider told the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.800 
we made the rear track wider told the
haunch<00:02:10.560> rear<00:02:10.860> outboard<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.879> then<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:12.599> made

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
haunch rear outboard and then they made

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.050 
haunch rear outboard and then they made
a<00:02:12.840> backlight<00:02:13.260> nearer<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.790> order<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
a backlight nearer so in order to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
a backlight nearer so in order to
achieve<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.599> really<00:02:16.170> wide<00:02:16.349> fender<00:02:16.739> which

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
achieve that really wide fender which

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.180 
achieve that really wide fender which
gives<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> massacre<00:02:17.940> look<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:19.709> pulled

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
gives you that massacre look we pulled

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.369 
gives you that massacre look we pulled
the<00:02:20.400> wheels<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:21.030> 20<00:02:21.420> millimeters<00:02:21.900> per<00:02:21.959> side

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
the wheels out 20 millimeters per side

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.979 
the wheels out 20 millimeters per side
and<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.459> allowed<00:02:23.849> us<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> very

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
and that really allowed us to get a very

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.770 
and that really allowed us to get a very
very<00:02:25.200> strong<00:02:25.379> muscular<00:02:26.280> hunched<00:02:26.760> over<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
very strong muscular hunched over the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.080 
very strong muscular hunched over the
rear<00:02:27.930> wheels<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:29.129> we<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.370> said<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.879> wanted

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
rear wheels what we also said we wanted

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.520 
rear wheels what we also said we wanted
to<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.330> three<00:02:30.569> dimensional<00:02:30.720> quality<00:02:31.260> on

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
to have a three dimensional quality on

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.509 
to have a three dimensional quality on
this<00:02:31.650> car<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> look<00:02:32.190> at<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
this car if you look at all the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.759 
this car if you look at all the
surfacing<00:02:33.060> through<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> decklid<00:02:34.319> it's<00:02:34.560> it's

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
surfacing through the decklid it's it's

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.160 
surfacing through the decklid it's it's
a<00:02:34.950> very<00:02:34.980> trivial<00:02:35.370> mention<00:02:35.879> it's<00:02:36.480> very<00:02:36.900> unique

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
a very trivial mention it's very unique

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920 
a very trivial mention it's very unique
I<00:02:37.560> think<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> taillights<00:02:38.849> we<00:02:39.090> took<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.750> next

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I think the taillights we took the next

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
I think the taillights we took the next
step<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.799> got<00:02:40.950> inspired<00:02:41.280> by<00:02:41.549> 16<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.060> cars<00:02:42.390> but

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
step we got inspired by 16 I cars but

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
step we got inspired by 16 I cars but
you<00:02:42.989> did<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.470> very<00:02:43.500> modern<00:02:44.010> way<00:02:44.370> you'll

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you did it in a very modern way you'll

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.420 
you did it in a very modern way you'll
be<00:02:45.090> able<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.390> identify<00:02:45.599> this<00:02:46.049> car<00:02:46.440> from<00:02:46.680> miles

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
be able to identify this car from miles

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
be able to identify this car from miles
down<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> road<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:48.959> those<00:02:49.170> tri-bar

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
down the road just with those tri-bar

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.550 
down the road just with those tri-bar
taillamps<00:02:50.340> illuminated<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.780> night<00:02:51.810> it's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
taillamps illuminated at night it's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.050 
taillamps illuminated at night it's
unmistakable<00:02:53.459> Mustang

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
