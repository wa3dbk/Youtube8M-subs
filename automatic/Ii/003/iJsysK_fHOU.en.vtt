00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello dear viewers today we 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.540
 tell about the hero keeper of the light 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.219
 keeper wishes also known as boiler 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.769
 and do not confuse it with gandalf 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.400
 this hero is a great pusher with an emphasis on 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.230
 intelligence 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 although his diverse abilities 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 make it a great choice for others 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 There are no tasks and lumen. This is an active target. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 skill striking the enemy on 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 distance up to thousand 600 units this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.609
 supported ability which can 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.859
 interrupt if necessary but for each 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.559
 second you get plus 100 damage and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 increase the distance action hold 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 skills can be up to 5 seconds and then you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 you can deal 500 damage to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 very far distance as 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 accumulation will increase the area 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 visibility in his direction as well as she 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 will damage siege creeps 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.300
 mana lik is very similar to ability 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 bloodseeker archer but she makes 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.770
 opponent to lose mana instead of health 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 target affected by this ability will be 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.539
 lose five percent of maximum mana 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.300
 every 100 units passed it will be 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 last as long as seven seconds and as if one 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.479
 This is not enough 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.740
 if the target is over it will be mana 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.689
 announced by two point two 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.189
 seconds 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.990
 one of the downsides of this ability 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.850
 is that if the target move 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 more than 300 units and a half 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 seconds for example using the ability 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.390
 blink and mana level will not decrease to 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 besides this ability is nothing at all 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 will make the opponent if he will stand 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 in place 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.159
 chakra magic is extremely simple in its 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.740
 Essentially the ability to apply it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.750
 only to allies or to yourself under 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.909
 the effect of this ability will be the goal 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.220
 get 300 mana when sealed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.720
 reach its maximum units with 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.729
 immunized magic this ability 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.040
 not applicable 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.439
 spirit form unique ulta with her 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.140
 activation shrouds you glow 40 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.000
 seconds during this time your 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 The first Illuminati ability will be 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.500
 act somewhat differently as well 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 you will get two more abilities 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 first when using illuminati under 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.750
 action ulta 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.240
 you don't have to hold it instead 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.380
 this your copy will do it for you at that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.549
 while you can safely 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.740
 move 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.509
 first ability you get 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.150
 from ulta and to recall it is possible 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.950
 use only on one ally 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.959
 you can teleport her 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.329
 ally from anywhere to you after 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.370
 a three second delay is only 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.409
 seems like a cool skill because if your 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.799
 ally on time this delay get 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.299
 damage abilities are interrupted 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.420
 last advantage ulta and lazaro 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.099
 the second ability of the blind nlite is and i 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.739
 ability to blind 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.159
 the enemy is in a radius of 600 75 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.769
 units 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.140
 forcing him to miss 80 percent 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.970
 as well for five seconds besides 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.920
 this ability if you use it 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.230
 straight at the opponent throws him away 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.799
 250 from the center of the lesion 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.250
 units in 0.4 seconds besides it is not 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.109
 interrupts supported skill 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.620
