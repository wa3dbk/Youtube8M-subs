a partial rebuild I guess you could say
due<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> uh<00:00:27.560> piston<00:00:28.560> failure<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.420> was<00:00:30.420> driving

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
due to uh piston failure I was driving

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.519 
due to uh piston failure I was driving
home<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:30.840> work<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.289> day<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.500> started

piston now you could see from inside the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.290 
piston now you could see from inside the
engine<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.469> broken<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.210> pulled<00:00:51.210> the

engine what was broken I pulled the
engine<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.049 
engine out and here it is and this is
the<00:00:53.489> piston<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> number<00:00:54.809> 2<00:00:54.960> piston<00:00:56.059> broken

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the piston it's a number 2 piston broken

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
the piston it's a number 2 piston broken
here<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.270> supposed<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.050> come

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
here is supposed to look like this come

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.430 
here is supposed to look like this come
low<00:00:58.680> low<00:00:58.739> down<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.449> but<00:01:00.449> instead<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:01.289> look

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
low low down there but instead they look

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
low low down there but instead they look
like<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:02.090> pretty<00:01:03.090> gnarly<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.960> pretty

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
like this pretty gnarly it's pretty

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710 
like this pretty gnarly it's pretty
pretty<00:01:04.589> surprised<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.760> what

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pretty surprised to see that but what

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090 
pretty surprised to see that but what
gave<00:01:06.900> me<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> reason<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> tear<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.070> uh

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gave me a reason to tear it down so uh

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.410 
gave me a reason to tear it down so uh
okay<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.880> too<00:01:08.939> much<00:01:10.670> but<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.060> reason<00:01:12.330> for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
okay way too much but the reason for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.100 
okay way too much but the reason for
this<00:01:12.510> video<00:01:12.840> isn't<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:14.659> rebuild<00:01:15.659> or

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this video isn't so much rebuild or

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
this video isn't so much rebuild or
anything<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
anything like that because there is just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.359 
anything like that because there is just
lots<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> lots<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.350> information<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.100> over

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
lots and lots of information to go over

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
lots and lots of information to go over
even<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> simple<00:01:21.360> rebuild<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.250> know

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
even for a simple rebuild like you know

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
even for a simple rebuild like you know
these<00:01:23.490> these<00:01:23.820> color<00:01:24.090> markings<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.689> what

thought that would be but we're just
gonna<00:01:32.280> talk<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.670> plastic<00:01:33.150> age<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.810> today

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
gonna talk about plastic age for today

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.160

I didn't want to zero to fifty but I

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.580 
I didn't want to zero to fifty but I
mean<00:04:56.699> I<00:04:56.729> can't<00:04:56.940> do<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.180> increments<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.750> pull

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
mean I can't do it in increments I pull

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.930 
mean I can't do it in increments I pull
it<00:04:58.680> about<00:04:58.830> half<00:04:59.009> way<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.280> mean<00:04:59.580> it's<00:04:59.699> just<00:04:59.729> uh

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
it about half way I mean it's just uh

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.719 
it about half way I mean it's just uh
just<00:05:00.240> feel<00:05:00.860> note<00:05:01.860> eighty<00:05:02.039> pounds<00:05:02.340> feels<00:05:02.520> like

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
just feel note eighty pounds feels like

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.570 
just feel note eighty pounds feels like
you<00:05:02.879> can<00:05:03.000> guess<00:05:03.180> forty<00:05:03.860> okay<00:05:04.860> then<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.400> come

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
you can guess forty okay then you come

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.610 
you can guess forty okay then you come
back<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.879> do<00:05:05.969> the<00:05:06.060> final<00:05:06.270> torque<00:05:10.669> eighty<00:05:12.620> and

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
back and do the final torque eighty and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:22.129 
back and do the final torque eighty and
same<00:05:14.069> thing<00:05:14.099> over<00:05:14.280> here<00:05:20.539> there<00:05:21.539> we<00:05:21.629> go<00:05:21.750> alright

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
same thing over here there we go alright

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.350 
same thing over here there we go alright
and<00:05:22.409> that<00:05:22.740> brings<00:05:22.949> up<00:05:23.069> a<00:05:23.129> good<00:05:23.250> point<00:05:23.310> is<00:05:23.789> when

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
and that brings up a good point is when

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.670 
and that brings up a good point is when
you<00:05:24.449> put<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.750> plastic<00:05:24.930> edge<00:05:25.289> on<00:05:25.440> there<00:05:25.620> you

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
you put the plastic edge on there you

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.709 
you put the plastic edge on there you
want<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> make<00:05:25.919> sure<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> crank<00:05:26.729> doesn't

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
want to make sure that the crank doesn't

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.209 
want to make sure that the crank doesn't
turn<00:05:27.900> because<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:28.319> will<00:05:28.409> smear<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.770> plastic

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
turn because it will smear the plastic

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.140 
turn because it will smear the plastic
and<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:30.120> might<00:05:30.240> give<00:05:30.449> you<00:05:30.599> a<00:05:30.659> long<00:05:31.380> measurement

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
and it might give you a long measurement

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.459 
and it might give you a long measurement
okay<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.690> now<00:05:33.779> this<00:05:33.870> torque<00:05:34.139> down<00:05:34.289> there

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
okay so now this torque down there

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.930 
okay so now this torque down there
there's<00:05:34.680> no<00:05:34.800> weight<00:05:35.009> time<00:05:35.279> there's<00:05:35.550> no<00:05:35.669> soak

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
there's no weight time there's no soak

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.529 
there's no weight time there's no soak
time<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.050> take<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.319> right<00:05:37.409> back<00:05:37.560> off<00:05:41.539> now

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
time you just take it right back off now

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:49.580 
time you just take it right back off now
loosen<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:42.990> one<00:05:46.340> loosen<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.460> one

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
loosen that one loosen that one

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.680 
loosen that one loosen that one
and<00:05:50.220> they're<00:05:50.370> just<00:05:50.520> gonna<00:05:50.700> back<00:05:51.330> right<00:05:51.540> back

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
and they're just gonna back right back

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:03.710 
and they're just gonna back right back
out<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:59.210> no<00:06:00.380> pull<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.410> up<00:06:02.389> now<00:06:03.389> the<00:06:03.510> same

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
out of it no pull it up now the same

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.010 
out of it no pull it up now the same
plastic<00:06:04.280> color<00:06:05.280> will<00:06:05.490> be<00:06:05.580> on<00:06:05.700> the<00:06:05.850> bearing<00:06:06.810> cat

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
plastic color will be on the bearing cat

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.930 
plastic color will be on the bearing cat
and<00:06:07.260> you<00:06:07.320> can't<00:06:07.530> see<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.770> here<00:06:07.800> I'm<00:06:08.730> gonna

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
and you can't see it here I'm gonna

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.790 
and you can't see it here I'm gonna
marry<00:06:09.150> them<00:06:09.240> what<00:06:09.360> measure<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.290> one<00:06:10.470> on<00:06:10.620> the

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
marry them what measure the one on the

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.360 
marry them what measure the one on the
bearing<00:06:11.870> for<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.020> crankshaft<00:06:13.620> journal<00:06:14.220> there

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
bearing for the crankshaft journal there

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.580 
bearing for the crankshaft journal there
and<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.930> measure<00:06:16.139> it<00:06:18.110> those<00:06:19.110> brilliant

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
and the measure it those brilliant

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.980 
and the measure it those brilliant
inventions<00:06:20.120> with<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.150> wrapper<00:06:21.540> you<00:06:21.630> just<00:06:21.840> cut<00:06:21.960> a

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
inventions with a wrapper you just cut a

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.980 
inventions with a wrapper you just cut a
piece<00:06:22.050> of<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.410> wrapper<00:06:22.560> off<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:24.570> it<00:06:24.690> has<00:06:24.810> the

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
piece of the wrapper off and it has the

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.330 
piece of the wrapper off and it has the
standard<00:06:25.200> on<00:06:25.500> it<00:06:25.880> it's<00:06:26.880> got<00:06:27.090> both<00:06:28.130> metric<00:06:29.130> and

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
standard on it it's got both metric and

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.120 
standard on it it's got both metric and
standard<00:06:30.320> since<00:06:31.320> I<00:06:31.380> live<00:06:31.530> in<00:06:31.590> America<00:06:31.650> are<00:06:32.070> you

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
standard since I live in America are you

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.550 
standard since I live in America are you
standard<00:06:32.520> now<00:06:33.450> but<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.870> book<00:06:34.080> gives<00:06:34.290> you<00:06:34.380> both

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
standard now but the book gives you both

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.250 
standard now but the book gives you both
if<00:06:34.710> you<00:06:34.800> choose<00:06:35.040> it<00:06:35.070> doesn't<00:06:35.370> really<00:06:35.460> matter

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
if you choose it doesn't really matter

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.810 
if you choose it doesn't really matter
all<00:06:37.260> right<00:06:37.470> so<00:06:38.160> you<00:06:38.220> just<00:06:38.280> run<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.550> up<00:06:39.139> here

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
all right so you just run it up here

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.430 
all right so you just run it up here
then<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:41.880> check<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.330> width<00:06:42.479> all<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.350> way

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
then you check the width all the way

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.190 
then you check the width all the way
across<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:44.180> right<00:06:45.180> seems<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:45.690> be<00:06:45.810> a<00:06:45.840> little<00:06:46.020> bit

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
across it right seems to be a little bit

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.530 
across it right seems to be a little bit
smaller<00:06:46.440> than<00:06:46.590> 15,000<00:06:47.580> maybe<00:06:48.180> a<00:06:48.270> little<00:06:48.419> bit

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
smaller than 15,000 maybe a little bit

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.400 
smaller than 15,000 maybe a little bit
right<00:06:48.690> there<00:06:48.770> I'm<00:06:49.770> bigger<00:06:50.010> than<00:06:50.100> 20,000<00:06:50.910> so

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
right there I'm bigger than 20,000 so

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.830 
right there I'm bigger than 20,000 so
it's<00:06:52.410> between<00:06:52.620> 15<00:06:53.220> and<00:06:53.250> 20<00:06:53.669> and<00:06:53.760> the<00:06:54.330> spec<00:06:54.810> for

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
it's between 15 and 20 and the spec for

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.719 
it's between 15 and 20 and the spec for
this<00:06:55.169> is<00:06:55.500> between<00:06:56.370> 1<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:56.729> 30<00:06:57.060> thousands<00:06:57.979> so<00:06:58.979> so

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
this is between 1 and 30 thousands so so

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:00.680 
this is between 1 and 30 thousands so so
we're<00:06:59.880> good<00:07:00.060> there<00:07:00.270> and<00:07:00.300> I've<00:07:00.510> already

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
we're good there and I've already

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.469 
we're good there and I've already
checked<00:07:00.990> all<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.260> bearings<00:07:02.390> they're<00:07:03.390> all

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
checked all the bearings they're all

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.750 
checked all the bearings they're all
good<00:07:03.660> to<00:07:03.750> go<00:07:03.890> all<00:07:04.890> the<00:07:05.130> all<00:07:05.400> the<00:07:05.520> general

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
good to go all the all the general

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.170 
good to go all the all the general
bearings<00:07:06.180> all<00:07:06.419> the<00:07:07.610> connecting<00:07:08.610> rod<00:07:08.760> banks

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
bearings all the connecting rod banks

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.230 
bearings all the connecting rod banks
and<00:07:09.330> they're<00:07:09.450> well<00:07:09.750> within<00:07:09.900> spec<00:07:11.030> so<00:07:12.030> I<00:07:12.060> won't

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
and they're well within spec so I won't

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.810 
and they're well within spec so I won't
be<00:07:12.360> replacing<00:07:12.539> all<00:07:12.900> those<00:07:13.080> bearings<00:07:13.820> this

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
be replacing all those bearings this

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.279 
be replacing all those bearings this
time<00:07:15.000> around<00:07:15.180> maybe<00:07:15.360> next<00:07:15.600> time<00:07:15.810> I<00:07:15.840> mean<00:07:16.050> these

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
time around maybe next time I mean these

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.230 
time around maybe next time I mean these
bearings<00:07:16.650> have<00:07:16.710> been<00:07:16.830> known<00:07:17.010> to<00:07:17.190> last<00:07:17.430> you

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
bearings have been known to last you

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.790 
bearings have been known to last you
know<00:07:18.330> two<00:07:18.389> hundred<00:07:18.750> thousand<00:07:19.050> miles<00:07:19.200> or<00:07:19.410> so<00:07:19.560> so

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
know two hundred thousand miles or so so

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.909 
know two hundred thousand miles or so so
I<00:07:20.010> didn't<00:07:20.760> really<00:07:20.910> expect<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.210> have<00:07:21.360> to<00:07:21.919> place

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
I didn't really expect to have to place

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.200 
I didn't really expect to have to place
them<00:07:23.070> and<00:07:23.130> it<00:07:23.250> did<00:07:23.400> definitely<00:07:23.580> reduce<00:07:24.060> the

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
them and it did definitely reduce the

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.330 
them and it did definitely reduce the
cost<00:07:24.389> of<00:07:24.570> this<00:07:24.660> rebuild<00:07:25.070> because<00:07:26.070> all<00:07:26.250> I'm

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
cost of this rebuild because all I'm

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.600 
cost of this rebuild because all I'm
have<00:07:26.490> to<00:07:26.580> do<00:07:26.669> is<00:07:26.760> replace<00:07:26.970> the<00:07:28.310> Pistons<00:07:29.310> and

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
have to do is replace the Pistons and

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.260 
have to do is replace the Pistons and
the<00:07:29.669> Rings<00:07:29.880> and<00:07:30.330> then

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
the Rings and then

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.629 
the Rings and then
put<00:07:31.660> it<00:07:31.720> all<00:07:31.780> back<00:07:31.930> together<00:07:32.080> and<00:07:32.560> fire<00:07:33.400> back

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
put it all back together and fire back

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.939 
put it all back together and fire back
up<00:07:33.819> but<00:07:34.810> anyway<00:07:35.020> that's<00:07:35.139> plastic<00:07:35.380> age

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
up but anyway that's plastic age

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.150 
up but anyway that's plastic age
hopefully<00:07:36.910> was<00:07:37.000> informative<00:07:37.509> I<00:07:37.830> hope<00:07:38.830> it<00:07:38.979> kind

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 
hopefully was informative I hope it kind

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.980 
hopefully was informative I hope it kind
of<00:07:39.280> moved<00:07:39.910> some<00:07:40.120> of<00:07:40.210> the<00:07:40.300> fuzziness<00:07:40.599> on<00:07:40.840> how<00:07:40.930> to

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
of moved some of the fuzziness on how to

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.320 
of moved some of the fuzziness on how to
use<00:07:41.590> it<00:07:41.740> because<00:07:41.800> I<00:07:41.949> was<00:07:42.069> I<00:07:42.250> was<00:07:42.370> I<00:07:42.639> was<00:07:42.940> lost<00:07:43.120> on

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
use it because I was I was I was lost on

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.080 
use it because I was I was I was lost on
it<00:07:43.509> but<00:07:43.750> uh<00:07:43.780> that's<00:07:44.650> it<00:07:44.830> I<00:07:45.039> hope<00:07:45.400> it<00:07:45.550> up<00:07:45.639> take

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
it but uh that's it I hope it up take

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.120 
it but uh that's it I hope it up take
care
