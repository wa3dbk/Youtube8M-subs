the radius and we're going to type in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.140 
the radius and we're going to type in
3.5<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.549> decides<00:01:35.549> we're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.030> bring

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
3.5 and decides we're going to bring

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.960 
3.5 and decides we're going to bring
them<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> 4<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.700> copies

I'll select the middle end on make sure

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
I'll select the middle end on make sure
it<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.869> second<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> I'll<00:01:56.100> change<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it is the second one and I'll change the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.410 
it is the second one and I'll change the
radius<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> 2.5<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> sides<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.189> 4<00:01:59.490> now

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
radius to 2.5 out of the sides of 4 now

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990 
radius to 2.5 out of the sides of 4 now
the<00:02:00.479> third<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.170> gone<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> type<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the third in gone I'm going to type a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.709 
the third in gone I'm going to type a
radius<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.570> 1.5<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.880> way<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> have

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
radius of 1.5 the way I know I have

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.600 
radius of 1.5 the way I know I have
these<00:02:06.899> three<00:02:07.140> shapes<00:02:07.439> which<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:07.950> needed<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
these three shapes which are needed to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.920 
these three shapes which are needed to
create<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.420> loft<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:12.000> press<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.480> W<00:02:12.840> again

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
create this loft this press up W again

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.710 
create this loft this press up W again
to<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.319> back

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
to go back

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.850 
to go back
four<00:02:13.960> viewports<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.260> think<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.680> just

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
four viewports now I think we can just

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.820 
four viewports now I think we can just
delete<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.550> box<00:02:21.760> now<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.060> don't<00:02:22.180> need<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.630> now

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
delete the box now I don't need that now

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.560 
delete the box now I don't need that now
now<00:02:23.830> we<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.100> add<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.400> loft<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.060> first<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.480> all

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
now we can add the loft but first of all

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.240 
now we can add the loft but first of all
