00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 and good morning to all these I live 4,66 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.469
 for time break plate I hope that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.059
 you are fine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 today I'm doing the presentation of 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 photos styling an application that you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.080
 to give effect to your 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 photos so for those who already use 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.279
 instagram on the iphone I think you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.760
 will quickly understand the system of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 photo styler so for a small example 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 in this application it's really 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 very simple you just need to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.829
 load an image so I would take 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 this one for the example and you have 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 really all the effects that come from 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.379
 precedes which are already pre defined which 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.680
 will allow you to improve 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.379
 let's say your photo of a little bit of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.489
 two styles without being they 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 stalled on on photoshop etc 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.590
 so I really have a lot 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 a lot of up close 7 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.300
 so after that it's of course every 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.840
 nobody is different at the neck 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 his expectations 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 so for the example is worth choosing a 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.130
 only she likes me 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 so of course you can preview 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.670
 pressing your band spaces 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 as if you are in your finder etc 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 you can preview and before 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 the one that touches the arrow keys of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 your keyboard a snack you have 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 found one that you like you press 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 on enter she'll open it in a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.750
 table where there you still have the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.250
 possibility of being able to change 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 for example you want to make a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 rotation of your image or so good 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 then you want to put a texture 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.200
 above other frame images finally 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 effects I leave you rivals 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.149
 really he is he is well complete 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.119
 this app so it costs when 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.369
 even around 20 euros 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.470
 it's not given so it's really 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.240
 it has potential 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.689
 without being really connoisseur for 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.159
 someone who has never done in 10 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.350
 gold of image editing 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.790
 that it will be it top and frankly you there 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.380
 mellow your pictures will really 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.390
 beautiful in the end 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 so this is an application that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 I wanted to introduce you because for 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.590
