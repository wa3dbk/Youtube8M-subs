00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460
 greetings boys and girls today I bring you a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.460
 burning video 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.430
 this is a homemade makeup and resur 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.189
 for movies and with a budget we would use 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.919
 prosthesis and we would get more realism 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.070
 We start by adding in a bowl one 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:28.730
 little water and a little bit of glycerin what 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.579
 we heat for 30 40 seconds act 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.350
 often we add another little bit to the mix 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.170
 of jelly and a pinch of makeup 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.750
 we have to have a similar texture 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.390
 to it when the mixture is cooling 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.490
 it is acquiring an aspect more and more 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.310
 solid anyway we can go back to 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.500
 heat it by scraping with the spatula and 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.350
 circular shape we do some small 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.260
 holes in the flesh the joke of yours 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.870
 not for the love of God 'we blend with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 talcum powder we make up the interior 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.650
 of the eyes with garnet shadow 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 we reinforce the crevices with shadows 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.090
 dark brown and black 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.190
 and with a thick brush we give a pass 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.000
 of black shadow throughout the area and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.340
 contours to give it a look 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 carbonized then we repeat the process 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.320
 with garnet shadow with sponge 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.830
 textures we add blood to the area 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.830
 affected 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.360
 I used water to dilute a little 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.090
 blood we add clots you know 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.070
 cotton mixed with artificial blood and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.290
 a little black shadow inside 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.660
 of some of the holes 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.660
 we reinforce the volumes with shadow 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.310
 we give the finishing touches to our 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.310
 makeup 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.440
 and scare fear 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.670
