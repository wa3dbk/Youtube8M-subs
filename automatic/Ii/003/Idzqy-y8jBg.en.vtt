00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 we are with riccardo polizzy charcoal 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:10.940
 last year's balance sheet 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.940
 this increasingly fierce perry 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.730
 will continue on this line to be 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 good a little bad and above all you are 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 tired of this character or not 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 after almost thirteen years it becomes one 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 challenge to be more and more credible in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.450
 these waves of malice and goodness the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.899
 budget always sees the possibility of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.789
 growing in surplus is therefore a reason in 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.309
 more always to work well for 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.280
 have stimuli in fiction yes 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.710
 he understands why he has this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 attitude towards life 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.079
 dinner there was some reference to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.270
 his childhood rather than what that is 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 made him so cynical after a 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.799
 sandro's deafness problem 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.560
 irons two years after his birth yes 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.240
 suddenly discovers irons he knows 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 the sign language that was 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 an experience among other things 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 interesting because I had it right 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.400
 to do with a teacher who has me 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.400
 often explained that children 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 of disabled people often come 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.670
 considered as their redemption 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.670
 staff for which a picture came out 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.070
 psychological of a ferry always goad 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 to always do the best to give the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 maximum therefore that he had no type 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.860
 of franking with a failure but 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.680
 always had to always excel on 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 everything and everyone is facing now 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.610
 this theme by son of sandro 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.100
 in short, quite dramatic 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 he even attempted suicide like 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.190
 see it irons and how you see this 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.660
 in short, we are the topic of juvenile distress 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.700
 we have great luck before 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.310
 all that fiction makes us the filter 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 so I never confuse what 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.470
 it can be a real human drama that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.140
 it creates suffering that creates pain 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.350
 unspeakable that just talking about it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.950
 certainly reduces in the case of sandro 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.430
 irons 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 there is a great weakness that leads him to 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.709
 justify this extreme act which 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.019
 thank heaven turns into a 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.450
 attempt to be a parent often 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.820
 shrewd that protect the child who is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.730
 follow is not enough there are some 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.940
 problems affecting youth 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.000
 which often escape even the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.680
 understanding often are inconveniences 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.500
 derive from the environment from 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.780
 attendance or can also be 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.300
 multiple or some probably there 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.050
 I ignore and in our course 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.110
 a place in the sun the function of a ferry 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.300
 so negative as a father if he had 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 to make real parents understand how not 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.290
 we must behave and this is the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 function one of the many functions it has 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.980
 also a place in the sun 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.610
 according to you then irons but for example 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.130
 even with this new fallout with 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.350
 marina looks rather like it's all one 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.690
 It has done more power to the feelings 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.490
 ruins this this love that seemed 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.550
 finally a love ferino irons a but a 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.180
 its a way to but i've heard in life 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.620
 say from some people but I love it and then 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.710
 they did atrocious things in the name of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.690
 this love and therefore definitely irons 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.310
 in the negative sense and this for how much 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.700
 regards the approach of 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.640
 approach of irons to the Jordanian navy 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.670
 it was definitely always an exercise of 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.950
 can a fall at a time when 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.070
 he was vulnerable but also a 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.959
 desire to take revenge on dirtying 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.000
 this is this new love story 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.730
 because in any case also Giorgio sartori is 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.210
 a rival irons and we say perhaps the 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:29.409
 character that best represents this 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.379
 let's say this is also economic well-being 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.300
 this life that many cannot 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.300
 allow precisely a life a 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.779
 po posillipina the problem did not arise 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.899
 precisely of people who instead have 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:46.149
 he knows just problems for cheap 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:49.149
 here it is not touched by problems 

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:53.219
 social issues that much in regards to 

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:55.239
 for example, social issues 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.849
 that of having a greater sensitivity 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:00.249
 towards those who are carriers of 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.449
 handicap is a theme that irons has 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.449
 approached quite evenly 

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:10.089
 another is a decent one on transplantation 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.969
 of organs 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:15.099
 when filippo had the problem that 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.639
 he must have had a kidney 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.689
 surely he behaved in a manner 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.339
 very wrong what exactly a 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.669
 place in the sun meant towards 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:27.350
 of whom through money seeks to 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.650
 grab a 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.720
 a right to life was just what 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.820
 that we wanted to report instead you 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.120
 he just says he seems committed to 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.420
 helmet and other campaigns 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.570
 social campaigns 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.660
 there are social issues that touch you 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.610
 a station sees us active in many 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.800
 social fields 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.850
 there are many associations for example 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.070
 that trying to protect the sick in 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.440
 various phases 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.080
 or 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.810
 who is suffering from multiple sclerosis 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.420
 or for those who must support the 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.800
 another very expensive bone marrow transplant 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:14.790
 was that about fostering here in Naples 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.610
 practically children who are not 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.650
 orphans simply come from 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.490
 difficult families and need to 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.860
 a firm family structure that 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.930
 repropose what they lack then 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.060
 we ran for irene and irene 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.060
 an association born some years ago 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.720
 for the people who need to 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.350
 assistance in the terminal phase of the 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.090
 illnesses 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.050
 you definitely need to have attention 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.790
 greater to all these initiatives 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.050
 more often you are afraid maybe 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.490
 to fall into the hands of associations 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:56.700
 scams conducted by swindlers who 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:59.970
 do not use the goods they collect for 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.430
 do precisely what they set out to 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.250
 statute and therefore the attitude of 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.370
 many people at hand I don't give anything 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.980
 because I don't want to risk this 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.110
 dullness we should lose a little bit 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.730
 there are so many ways to be useful to 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.300
 others and in the social sphere 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:25.730
 in my opinion we are small drops that 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:29.669
 compared to the great ocean I am 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.340
 very small, almost useless, but each one 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.940
 of us has his own personality his 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.650
 power 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.220
 together we can do a lot for the 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.220
 social
