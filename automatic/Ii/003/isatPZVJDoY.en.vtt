00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 so this one covered up if you want 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.040
 connect the control of 34 to play 3 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.270
 Well, today I'm going to bring you all the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.270
 necessary tips to do it 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.800
 that all his men today 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.350
 I'm going to teach you how to connect your control of 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.029
 pli 4 in the play 3 in network is super 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.430
 simple nothing else is going to teach them a 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.260
 a little more extra information first 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.210
 that nothing reaches us look good but here 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.160
 I have my control of play 3 is 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.260
 on we must turn it off let's do the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.730
 tight play button 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 if we pay here 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.200
 control is already completely off 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 then we will connect the control of the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.379
 play 4 to play 3 via usb can not 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.199
 wirelessly I repeat you can not 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.940
 wirelessly if by any 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.580
 reason nothing else have pure control 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 of play 4 are going to need a cable 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.960
 usb to micro and if they do not have cable the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.239
 I'm going to leave it down here in the description 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 an Amazon link to check what 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.350
 type of cable since you connect it to power 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.159
 control 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.409
 so play 4 now extra information the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.229
 pantallita touch is not going to serve here in 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.119
 the play 3 will not serve the button either 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.890
 of the play the detector function 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.390
 movements when you detect inclines 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.580
 the control back and forth there 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.740
 or wherever it's not going to serve either 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.180
 will not vibrate maybe if those 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.430
 functions are going to put them in a 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.549
 system update of play 3 tal 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.280
 It's not safe, I suppose it also serves 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.840
 super basically in some games 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.610
 low shock in the description I'm going to 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.470
 let games are serving well and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.060
 what games are serving means let's 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.539
 to do a quick test with the metal 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.360
 slug x from play 1 here on play 3 how 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.759
 put if it serves here all cool the button 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.039
 of being going to be like the select and the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 Options button is going to be like the start 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.080
 we our mission x 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080
 we say that he had 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 karanka more or less 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.659
 we're 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.640
 if the person in whom we come 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.170
 and if you are going to want to leave the game 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.390
 they are going to have to grab a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.060
 control play 3 and press the button 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.760
 of play already to be able to leave the game 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.940
 because as I said the play button 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.700
 in the control of play 4 does not work 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.220
 then they are going to have to control that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.750
 with a control of play 3 but good as well 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.000
 it is easy and simple we have connected 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.800
 our control play four in play 3 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.180
 if you served them this little one too 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 they left like do not forget to leave a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.180
 comment something like eye and hunger 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.910
