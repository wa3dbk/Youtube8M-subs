00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.090
 hello to the new apartment I respect 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.000
 Now jump the cerebrum but respects 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 maybe there is one here 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.090
 competition we are here today in the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.330
 near Kassel and the people here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 raging yellow and we will be in the morning 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.199
 be near Mannheim and the only one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 Ask yourself and I could 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.929
 Ask is who has the greatest karasik 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 population outside of Japan outside 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.890
 the nature part of yamaguchi will be if 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.140
 or will it still be where we are 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 tomorrow and I can tell you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 both particles that Karasch terms 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.210
 absolutely impressed here we are now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.690
 at sven bender in kassel and if the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.159
 big pond 100 skin hundred thousand and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.640
 the number of karasik 45 karachi green 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.340
 is a karachi at 2,000 liters approximately 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.200
 and a little bit color ginsberg but me 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430
 faith - would have to do again 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.270
 you're just a passenger 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.909
 so if so is a very clear karasik 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.500
 kemmer am fenn and if he is his equal 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.390
 again we have to occupy all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.719
 easy to breed has come to us 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 if, by the way, about the first option where 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.590
 only karachi has been auctioned 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.200
 there we are all in there too 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 he was then scheduled and since then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.060
 There is nothing else for him I show 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.679
 they also have a movie by the way 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.500
 the part did not last long 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.840
 sven has already moved on his own 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.759
 will be involved soon and also built 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.869
 then the whole karachis will move 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.789
 I think we have a day there 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 work properly so is the camera 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.270
 in the hand and then we'll take a look 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 to a real karachi slaughter 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.660
 one second 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.490
 That's how you do that more 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.490
 then felt 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.079
 he comes the animal in the basket to the explorer 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 down 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:43.760
 otherwise one can not say that how much 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.620
 your world out if so in the hour 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.010
 be circulated here so 50,000 more 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.049
 I is every two hours once the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 so the lowest limit you still 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.689
 can drive 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.989
 better if it is circulated more frequently 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:00.129
 and we see a nice one here 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:06.379
 like at alex in bad soden salmÃ¼nster 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:09.349
 a big xxl ventilation where i mean 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.000
 200 dangly 200 depends on it 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.219
 and of course you want that, of course 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.040
 get oxygen into the water and clean 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:20.199
 but also co2 or nitrogen 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.549
 sometimes from the water in gas 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.379
 that 's important because I think so 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.680
 feed quantities are correspondingly here 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.810
 his 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.840
 What is the maximum amount of feed? 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.629
 three kilos a day while walking suddenly 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.579
 the maintenance costs in exorbitant in 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.340
 the height and the maintenance is sometimes 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.629
 more expensive than the purchase if you 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.180
 Looks like you're expecting every day 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.180
 three kilos and what do you currently find 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.439
 So he says that's okay with that 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.389
 microphone i have no different than i have 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.549
 It's hard to get a microphone, but he says 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.900
 he always mixes on the black label and 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.609
 Greens that is what we recommend 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.209
 what we have just in the shop offer 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.900
 creating monsters and how tall is one 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.900
 great karas 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.530
 So 90 cm, the biggest will measure here 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.470
 and by that the cashier is it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.039
 In any case over 70 if I even 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.039
 over 80 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.090
 and that's really big now 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:44.190
 I'll show you the movies 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:46.680
 system we also have a smartphone 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.320
 the end is near standard paper plus 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.889
 endlessly while silver made when it ja 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.190
 satisfied 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.010
 It's a good job and back there 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.490
 after that the biofilms are at the bottom 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.479
 underneath and as said 50,000 will be pro 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.530
 circulated hour 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:08.550
 Here is another small one, we are called 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.900
 again with french bulldog if 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.900
 is heiko heiko 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.820
 a few nice and immigration 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.100
 So the water is very nice 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.639
 So you have to say so for the conservation 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.090
 optimally one sees here and there a few 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.039
 severed scales 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.990
 but that is not least of all 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.580
 fact that owes that here 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.979
 of course always in a tight space 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.590
 romp around the feeders rome and the 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:11.250
 one knows from japan just as one does that 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.770
 from here knows where mechanical much 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.410
 rubbed is moved there you have 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:20.460
 of course, the effect also beautiful less 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.199
 very few chemicals here too 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.320
 other variants have largely 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.650
 the base also develops nicely 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.650
 out 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.750
 and makes prevent a garden hut 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.750
 still 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:58.680
 just a functional pond for 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:07:01.050
 raising a cash register at the sea a the 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.940
 is karas when man is from the 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.780
 feeding place is moved away then is with 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.259
 it could be that one hardly 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.259
 forage missed 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.800
 then we'll be up tomorrow 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:22.080
 ludwigshafen looking forward to what we got there too 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.500
 face get it there is one 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.500
 little food 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.430
 so in this sense until the next blog
