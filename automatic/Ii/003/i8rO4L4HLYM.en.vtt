00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.220
 one of departure I got myself into this school 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.040
 of theater mainly by the approach 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.530
 and the tradition that has in the most 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.450
 ancient experimental theater that was founded 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.220
 Here I find that compared to a lot 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.660
 school the people that I entered the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.630
 University of Chile especially the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.460
 theater has a great social concept and 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.410
 a virtue that very few students 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.590
 of data they have that is work the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.590
 rigor 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.820
 and from the back it's about designing that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.350
 graffiti costume lighting makeup 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 in theater cinema television 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.790
 in big game between in fact the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 specialty engraved by the workshop 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 because it attracted me as a workshop as a place 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 as a space where you can work 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.790
 there are many people always participating 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.160
 they are always doing different things 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.760
 the department of theory of the arts 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.930
 some research around the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.700
 arts and artistic disciplines 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.310
 responding to both their relationship with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 production as to its linkage with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 the research of the art faculty 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.000
 has three libraries that are central 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.480
 these visual arts of theory their 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.680
 collections are very important because 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.000
 that they library that they have better 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.870
 historical collection related to art 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.870
 do not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.560
 it's interesting how the amount of people 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 that arrives and the different visions that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.680
 appear and how they converge in the same 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.630
 space and how they are feeding 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.090
 through time and with that is very 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.920
 powerful what is being created here as 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.920
 in training and good 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.450
 ah 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.849
 good 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 the music and sound department has 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.670
 created two student groups of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.920
 great scope as they are the orchestra 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.590
 of the faculty of arts and the band 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.420
 symphonic these groupings in addition to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.610
 have an emphasis on the formation of 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.989
 musicians in a set allow us 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.730
 show the work of our 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.590
 students and also from our 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.870
 academic programs in the various 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.970
 extension activities that we do 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.970
 both inside and outside Santiago 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.370
 the faculty of arts have the longest 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.230
 extension tradition to the artistic of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.120
 Chile- the one that maintains and renews 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.010
 manifesting permanently in 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 its various spaces and radiating the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.890
 artistic culture always renewed and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.890
 avant-garde
