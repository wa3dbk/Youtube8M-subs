00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
street lights off Western power and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.100 
street lights off Western power and
everything<00:00:47.000> looked<00:00:47.150> like<00:00:47.240> it<00:00:47.510> was<00:00:47.630> going<00:00:47.960> well

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
everything looked like it was going well

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.840 
everything looked like it was going well
until<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.530> told<00:00:48.890> them<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:49.130> I<00:00:49.400> was<00:00:49.550> going<00:00:49.730> to

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
until I told them that I was going to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.010 
until I told them that I was going to
test<00:00:50.150> them<00:00:50.680> against<00:00:51.680> some<00:00:51.920> LED<00:00:52.310> streetlights

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
test them against some LED streetlights

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.210 
test them against some LED streetlights
and<00:00:54.020> then<00:00:54.470> all<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.770> sudden<00:00:55.100> they're<00:00:55.190> not

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.210 
and then all of a sudden they're not
interested<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:55.880> doing<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.270> because<00:00:57.220> Western

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
interested in doing that because Western

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.980 
interested in doing that because Western

use the street lights use and they make

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.100 
use the street lights use and they make
a<00:01:06.470> lot<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.740> money<00:01:06.920> out<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:08.930> they

looking light that's very heavy because
of<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.220> big<00:03:12.519> heat<00:03:12.730> seek<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.269> back<00:03:14.280> now

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
of the big heat seek on the back now

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.479 
of the big heat seek on the back now
this<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.639> a<00:03:15.669> 50<00:03:16.419> watt<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.889> you'll<00:03:18.220> notice

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
this is a 50 watt one and you'll notice

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.420 
this is a 50 watt one and you'll notice
straightaway<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.359> there<00:03:19.569> they<00:03:20.530> make<00:03:20.739> these<00:03:21.010> to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
straightaway in there they make these to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.670 
straightaway in there they make these to
go<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> lot<00:03:21.790> brighter<00:03:23.099> okay<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.849> can<00:03:25.000> get<00:03:25.150> these

go a lot brighter okay you can get these

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.920 
go a lot brighter okay you can get these
any<00:03:26.680> what<00:03:26.829> did<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.130> want<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.760> now<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> bit

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
know what it's looking at I'm the walks

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.860 
know what it's looking at I'm the walks
over<00:03:33.489> there<00:03:33.790> at<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> power<00:03:34.209> switch<00:03:34.389> I'm<00:03:34.750> going

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
over there at the power switch I'm going

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.199 
over there at the power switch I'm going
to<00:03:34.930> turn<00:03:35.109> this<00:03:36.359> 50<00:03:37.359> watt<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.989> 40<00:03:38.319> watt<00:03:38.470> one

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
to turn this 50 watt to 40 watt one

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.020 
to turn this 50 watt to 40 watt one
towards<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.299> fishpond

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.340

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
and that's what it looks like I hope it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.240 
and that's what it looks like I hope it
looks<00:03:45.500> nice<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:47.590> mean<00:03:48.590> that's<00:03:48.740> pretty<00:03:48.920> bright

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.650 

well<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.280> can<00:03:55.550> even<00:03:55.700> see<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.060> fish<00:03:56.240> in<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.450> pond

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660

well I can even see the fish in the pond
with<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:56.959> one<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:57.350> that's<00:03:57.470> that's<00:03:57.830> really

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
with this one so that's that's really

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.979 
with this one so that's that's really
good<00:03:58.310> that's<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.670> 50<00:03:58.970> watt<00:03:59.120> one<00:03:59.300> I'm<00:03:59.810> not

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
good that's the 50 watt one I'm not

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.190 
good that's the 50 watt one I'm not
going<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.170> test<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:01.510> 25<00:04:02.510> watt<00:04:02.720> one<00:04:02.900> because

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
going to test the 25 watt one because

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.540 
going to test the 25 watt one because
then<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.380> have<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.590> mess<00:04:03.860> around<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.340> wire<00:04:04.520> it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
then I have to mess around and wire it

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.580 
then I have to mess around and wire it
up<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:06.650> month<00:04:06.890> 24<00:04:07.340> while<00:04:07.550> patching<00:04:07.970> things<00:04:08.590> so

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
up to month 24 while patching things so

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.300 
up to month 24 while patching things so
there<00:04:10.220> we<00:04:10.310> go<00:04:10.340> that's<00:04:10.640> turned<00:04:11.000> off<00:04:14.860> okay<00:04:15.860> let's

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.870 

I<00:04:25.210> think<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.360> look<00:04:26.480> damn<00:04:26.720> sexy<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.700> think

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
I think that look damn sexy and I think

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.550 
I think that look damn sexy and I think
the<00:04:29.000> West<00:04:29.180> Australian<00:04:29.780> government<00:04:30.760> ie

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the West Australian government ie

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.500 
the West Australian government ie
synergy<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:34.270> prefer<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.450> call<00:04:35.630> them<00:04:35.840> syn<00:04:36.410> energy

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
synergy I prefer to call them syn energy

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.580 
synergy I prefer to call them syn energy
because<00:04:38.510> they<00:04:38.690> just<00:04:38.840> ripped<00:04:39.140> people<00:04:39.350> off

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
because they just ripped people off

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.550 
because they just ripped people off
they're<00:04:39.919> totally<00:04:40.400> simple<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:44.440> think<00:04:45.440> they

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
they're totally simple I think they

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.370 
they're totally simple I think they
should<00:04:45.770> be<00:04:45.800> pressured<00:04:46.600> into<00:04:47.600> replacing<00:04:48.260> all

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
should be pressured into replacing all

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.230 
should be pressured into replacing all
the<00:04:48.500> street<00:04:48.770> lights<00:04:48.800> with<00:04:49.250> LEDs<00:04:49.760> when<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
the street lights with LEDs when the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.950 
the street lights with LEDs when the
street<00:04:50.840> light<00:04:51.020> breaks<00:04:51.320> down<00:04:51.850> they<00:04:52.850> should<00:04:53.150> be

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
street light breaks down they should be

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.950 
street light breaks down they should be
made<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:55.030> replace<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.510> with<00:04:57.250> an<00:04:58.250> LED<00:04:58.520> yeah<00:04:59.270> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
made to replace it with an LED yeah you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.180 
made to replace it with an LED yeah you
know<00:05:00.080> they're<00:05:00.229> gonna<00:05:00.350> have<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.680> replace<00:05:00.950> it

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
know they're gonna have to replace it

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.070 
know they're gonna have to replace it
anyway<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:04.340> overall<00:05:04.940> cost<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.419> replacing

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
anyway so the overall cost of replacing

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.620 
anyway so the overall cost of replacing
a<00:05:06.320> streetlight<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:06.890> not<00:05:07.010> going<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.220> be<00:05:07.630> any

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
a streetlight it's not going to be any

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.460 
a streetlight it's not going to be any
greater<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:11.180> yeah<00:05:11.570> they<00:05:11.780> will<00:05:11.960> mother<00:05:12.140> as

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
greater and yeah they will mother as

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.080 
greater and yeah they will mother as
much<00:05:12.710> money<00:05:13.840> from<00:05:15.729> selling<00:05:16.990> power-hungry

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
much money from selling power-hungry

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.279 
much money from selling power-hungry
metal<00:05:20.090> halide<00:05:20.450> or<00:05:20.479> whatever<00:05:20.900> they<00:05:21.110> are<00:05:21.140> that

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
metal halide or whatever they are that

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.400 
metal halide or whatever they are that
they've<00:05:21.680> got<00:05:21.919> up<00:05:22.039> there<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:23.080> don't<00:05:24.080> know
