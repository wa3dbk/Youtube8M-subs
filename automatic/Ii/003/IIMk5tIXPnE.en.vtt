elemental with tributes and there's lots
to<00:06:09.450> it<00:06:09.750> so<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.230> looks<00:06:10.380> like<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.710> was<00:06:10.950> a<00:06:11.100> very

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
to it so it looks like it was a very

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.880 
to it so it looks like it was a very
well-received<00:06:12.030> game<00:06:12.330> on<00:06:12.510> the<00:06:12.570> playstation<00:06:12.890> 2

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
well-received game on the playstation 2

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.500 
well-received game on the playstation 2
and<00:06:13.920> I<00:06:14.070> think<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.340> yen<00:06:14.520> battle<00:06:14.940> system<00:06:15.360> is

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
and I think the yen battle system is

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.960 
and I think the yen battle system is
pretty<00:06:15.750> good<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:17.310> we're<00:06:17.670> going<00:06:17.730> to<00:06:17.850> have<00:06:17.880> a

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970
