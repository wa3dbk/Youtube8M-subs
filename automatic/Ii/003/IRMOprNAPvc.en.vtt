absolutely true one that's 16.08 another
second<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.640> half<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.360> is

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
second and a half we know that is

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.320 
second and a half we know that is
absolutely<00:03:25.470> phenomenal<00:03:26.000> he's<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> have

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
a couple more runs at this I think the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.890 
a couple more runs at this I think the
tires<00:03:29.489> are<00:03:29.670> still<00:03:29.880> often<00:03:30.030> let<00:03:30.330> me<00:03:30.480> know<00:03:30.630> but

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
tires are still often let me know but

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.140 
tires are still often let me know but
he's<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.830> at<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.160> with<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.580> was<00:03:32.790> amazing
