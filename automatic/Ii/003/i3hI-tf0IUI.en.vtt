00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
once it was um glued down but I feel

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.099 
once it was um glued down but I feel
that<00:03:04.269> if<00:03:04.840> Janet<00:03:05.590> made<00:03:05.859> their<00:03:06.100> hair<00:03:06.340> lines<00:03:06.609> a

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
that if Janet made their hair lines a

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.920 
that if Janet made their hair lines a
