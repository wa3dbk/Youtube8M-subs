times so we do now but then I'd only
have<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.610> two<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> month<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> really

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have one or two a month and I really

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
have one or two a month and I really
wouldn't<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.810> helping<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> many<00:01:49.470> people<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
wouldn't be helping that many people so

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
wouldn't be helping that many people so
I'm<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.350> quick

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
buck or anything like that I made to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609

help<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.420> many<00:01:54.450> people<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.960> possible<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.590> we

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
help as many people as possible so we

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.230 
help as many people as possible so we
made<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.460> different<00:01:56.759> philosophy<00:01:57.210> than

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
made a very different philosophy than

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
made a very different philosophy than
what<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> offices<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.460> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
what I think a lot of offices do so we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.990 
what I think a lot of offices do so we
try<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> keep<00:02:00.119> our<00:02:00.299> costs<00:02:00.630> very<00:02:00.990> low<00:02:01.290> any

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
try to keep our costs very low any

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.380 
try to keep our costs very low any
savings<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
savings we get because of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020 
savings we get because of
the<00:02:04.479> bulk<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.260> do<00:02:05.440> savings<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> hospital

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
the bulk we do savings to the hospital

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.270 
the bulk we do savings to the hospital
we<00:02:07.540> tend<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.840> pass<00:02:08.050> those<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.590> patients<00:02:09.130> I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
we tend to pass those on the patients I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
we tend to pass those on the patients I
don't<00:02:09.789> think<00:02:09.850> about<00:02:10.209> supporting<00:02:10.690> patients

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
don't think about supporting patients

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.660 
don't think about supporting patients
the<00:02:11.230> same<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.560> usually<00:02:11.709> doctors<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:12.400> about

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the same way usually doctors think about

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.699 
the same way usually doctors think about
it<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.420> things<00:02:13.540> we<00:02:13.720> bring<00:02:13.959> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
it and one of the things we bring to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.470 
it and one of the things we bring to
that<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.670> give<00:02:15.760> patients<00:02:15.970> my<00:02:16.240> cell
