00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.649
 Bad choice starts here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.479
 defensive do you and heiko westermann 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.579
 Well, I think they will not 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 matchwinner yann summer that's it 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.549
 a good card i like the summer 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.759
 I think that's really cool, good goalkeeper 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.860
 what could she do then swap me 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.070
 in the wrong position then i have star 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 player marco reus yes, of course, too 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.069
 a cool card I'll put it first 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.710
 with on the possibly stack lakic of 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.680
 Kaiserslautern is not coming 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.360
 shortlist rico benatelli 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 also does not come in the selection thomas 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.510
 power of herta no theodor gisela you 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440
 Of course , he does not get into it either 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.830
 shortlist 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.480
 georg niedermeier rouwen hennings 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.980
 he now in HSV in the second league 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.810
 of course that would be my top shot 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.910
 but he is not the only one 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.690
 he has come in eleven meters 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.630
 gonzalo jara also does not say that 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.590
 two cards from the first booster 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.050
 Maybe we can do it all the same 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.600
 top the next booster normal and 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.570

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.670
 Mario, however, only as a base 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.700
 I still take the first card with me 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.020
 too narrow a selection louis carius also he 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.110
 not marco russ to side kevin wimmer 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.040
 like to have a real kracher again 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.800

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.910

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.580
 My shortlist is these four 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.370
 Of course, players would have to yann 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.350

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.169
 eleven meters the boy is throwing his 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.630
