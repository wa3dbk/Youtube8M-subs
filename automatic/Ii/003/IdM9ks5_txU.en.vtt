00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 I was looking for what happened yesterday with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.379
 the fish in the park three of february 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.120
 we talk about the forests of Palermo where 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.800
 we were surprised by the news on the day of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 yesterday that dead fish had appeared 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.070
 it's not the first time that happens 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.750
 I remember we told this news 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.369
 in some other opportunity and of course what 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 is what the specialists explained 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.240
 about this topic that this could 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.560
 have to do with the high temperatures 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 anyway, it attracts attention because 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 there are put a lot of ducks per 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 example that did not suffer the same fate 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 but a specialist spoke here at c5n 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.430
 with us and this explained to us 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 Regarding this, it was a surprise not 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 he thinks so first instance 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.840
 think it's a problem of increasing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 water temperature the temperature goes 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.879
 going up and there is going to be a greater lack 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 of oxygen definitely all 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.500
 environments have a certain value of 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 dissolved oxygen is well in water that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 makes fish life possible 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.010
 we are talking between 5 and 6 or so 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 it is the ideal gentlemen that part by 1000 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 of oxygen dissolved in water 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.760
 when that good oxygen content drops 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.080
 lack of oxygen so that through the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.030
 gills the breathe 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.860
 what happened here is that I call the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.670
 attention that they are all size fish 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.370
 big 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.740
 which are the ones that need more oxygen 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.420
 also if there is a contaminant 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.950
 which is what one can presuppose 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 after the analyzes that have to 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.780
 to have done they should have appeared 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.670
 dead also all the postmen I 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.590
 from what I saw in the morning they are tarpons 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.390
 but I know it's a species that is in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.840
 All for nothing is a saying linked to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.170
 Parana river then is a waters saying 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.690
 open a viewpoint of flavor in 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.520
 definitive is the species let's say more 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.430
 important of the apple plant 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.190
 It is also the forage species that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.729
 feed all other species 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.680
 60% of the river's biomass production 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.350
 for 'seleÃ§ao' to the attention 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.119
 that similar weigh of such size are 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.830
 there it is already very clear that with this one 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.960
 background that I tell you should be surely 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.940
 a scum that told you that birds in 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.700
 their legs also fecundated egg is that 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.590
 their colonization methods that do not 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.330
 many papers the birds bring a bug 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 fertilized very questioned and stays there 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 he does it because tarpon there is not really 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 fish farming development not with blow 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.489
 career and that you have and if culture that 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.380
 always the flavors of just spot 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.610
 you are migrating fish 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.330
 open friend migrators 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 they are fish that migrate 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.800
 a migration what is called aggression 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.620
 reproductive all the parana of that go 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.600
 when that goes the larvae are born 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.580
 little eggs the long ones come when they arrive 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.770
 to the average parana they get into lagoons 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.010
 marginal is surely a niche of 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.010
 grade 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.110
 where they were directly did not 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.080
 reproduces there so the bug is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.750
 condemned to die in definitively also 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.860
 that are all fish and even in size 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.600
 equal 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.190
 also then if you can find 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.680
 several different to mere years of all 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
 but I do not know it's a weird phenomenon I do not know 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 if someone planted it to some of the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.160
 good grandparents will have thrown it and good 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.770
 will have grown has adapted 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.830
 between 50 and 70 fish are those that have 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.320
 deceased product of the lack of 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.540
 oxygen for a matter of elevated 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.420
 temperatures of the last days are the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.640
 that we had acted on the quality 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.410
 of water subtracting oxygen and are the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.750
 large species that are the ones that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.880
 they need more oxygen to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
 survive those who have suffered 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.450
 consequences of this decline in 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.620
 oxygen quality of the lake is 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.870
 punctually what are the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.480
 mostly shad species 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.280
 some catfish tarariras 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.410
 fundamentally the tarpons that is a 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.170
 species of great magnitude for what 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.240
 It's the lake and as I said it requires great 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.400
 amount of oxygen that good at 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.160
 these days has diminished product of the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.600
 high temperatures and also from the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.740
 minimums that have not been low and we have 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.180
 that the minimums have been very high 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.950
 which water has kept the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.560
 very high temperature 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.540
 a little abnormal for what is usual 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.489
 for the quality of guadalagua this has 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.590
 happened only in this lake here in 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.019
 the rose garden or in others in the area 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.269
 Palermo not only on the side of 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.489
 Rosedal given by its characteristics 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.260
 own as there are other lakes as per 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.000
 lake example regatta has a 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.100
 greater depth has a movement of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.079
 greater water with which this type of 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.330
 problems are not usually seen in the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.190
 lake regattas on the social side either 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.410
 but good exceptionally we have 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.410
 suffered this heat wave that acted 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 about the temperature of the water discard 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.840
 that the lake this one has a kind of 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.930
 contamination if I first want to say 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.790
 inform the lake is subjected to analysis 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.669
 newspapers in terms of their quality of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.200
 water and the last analysis of day 30 of 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.670
 December since the parameters 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.980
 they are normal 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.140
 with which we discard that 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.580
 option however today we have done 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.370
 analysis of the quality of the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.500
 water and from the dead fish to 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.190
 effects of discarding any other type 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.320
 of action other other symptoms of that 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.140
 helps us understand the situation is 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.430
 Habanos that only the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.770
 large species are those that have suffered 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.440
 the consequences the rest of the fish 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.170
 of smaller size are in good condition what 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.180
 same as the geese the gallaretas the 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.070
 ducks that also inhabit the lake and 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.520
 let's say they are developing their lives 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.520
 normal
