the<00:00:17.130> reason<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.180> chose<00:00:18.210> music<00:00:18.900> was

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the reason that we chose music was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650 
the reason that we chose music was
because<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.520> were<00:00:20.699> already<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.119> school<00:00:21.449> that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
because we were already a school that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500 
because we were already a school that
put<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> high<00:00:22.140> value<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.590> music<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.400> had<00:00:23.580> for

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
put a high value on music we had for

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.480 
put a high value on music we had for
many<00:00:24.660> years

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
many years

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.950 
many years
subsidized<00:00:26.490> music<00:00:27.029> tuition<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> school

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.740 
subsidized music tuition in the school
to<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> significant<00:00:28.800> extent<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:30.510> chose

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
to a significant extent and we chose

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.130 
to a significant extent and we chose
music<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:32.250> felt<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.579> music<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
music because we felt that music was a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410 
music because we felt that music was a
universal<00:00:34.890> language<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.059> something

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
students and we've repeated that each

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
students and we've repeated that each
year<00:01:15.180> looking<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.229> things<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.710> female

performers obviously particularly and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.020 
performers obviously particularly and
looking<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.280> things<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
looking for things which are going to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
looking for things which are going to
appeal<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> different<00:01:21.780> students<00:01:22.650> last<00:01:23.220> year

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
appeal to different students last year

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.030 
appeal to different students last year
we<00:01:23.580> had<00:01:23.729> an<00:01:23.820> all-girl<00:01:24.210> pop<00:01:25.200> group<00:01:25.500> because

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we had an all-girl pop group because

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
we had an all-girl pop group because
again<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.970> engaging<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.780> students

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
again it's about engaging all students

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
again it's about engaging all students
and<00:01:28.409> saying<00:01:28.560> music<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and saying music is for all of you it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.620 
and saying music is for all of you it's
not<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
not just for

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
not just for
particular<00:01:31.439> types<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.830> music<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> political

particular types of music and political

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
particular types of music and political
types<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.330> people<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.710> very<00:01:34.890> difficult<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
types of people it's very difficult to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
types of people it's very difficult to
quantify<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:36.090> school<00:01:36.450> has<00:01:36.659> changed<00:01:37.140> since

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
quantify how school has changed since

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
quantify how school has changed since
becoming<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.920> music<00:01:38.130> college<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.450> thinking

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
becoming a music college I was thinking

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
becoming a music college I was thinking
about<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.650> thinking<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.130> only<00:01:41.310> really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
about that and thinking you only really

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.870 
about that and thinking you only really
realize<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> stop<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.200> back

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
realize when you stop and you look back

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.820 
realize when you stop and you look back
because<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.060> incremental<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.290> gradual

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
because it's incremental and gradual

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.539 
because it's incremental and gradual
sometimes<00:01:47.340> rather<00:01:47.759> than<00:01:48.090> huge<00:01:49.250> some<00:01:50.250> things

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
sometimes rather than huge some things

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.050 
sometimes rather than huge some things
were<00:01:50.869> immediate<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.289> immediate<00:01:52.860> impact

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
were immediate and have immediate impact

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.820 
were immediate and have immediate impact
obviously<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> money<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:54.720> had<00:01:54.930> capital

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
obviously the money that we had capital

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.100 
obviously the money that we had capital
money<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.600> reinvested<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> music

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
money that we had reinvested in music

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
money that we had reinvested in music
technology<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.880> immediate

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
technology and that had an immediate

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.570 
technology and that had an immediate
impact<00:02:01.080> on<00:02:01.470> what<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.039> were<00:02:02.159> able<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> offer

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
impact on what we were able to offer

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.039 
impact on what we were able to offer
students<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> curriculum

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.530 

right<00:02:12.049> at<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.439> beginning<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:13.189> decided<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
right at the beginning we decided that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.179 
right at the beginning we decided that
what<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.870> wanted<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.620> engage<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
what we wanted to do is to engage the

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.399 
what we wanted to do is to engage the
whole<00:02:16.220> staff<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:17.150> using<00:02:17.659> music<00:02:17.959> across<00:02:18.170> the

for<00:04:13.079> those<00:04:13.200> children<00:04:13.560> who<00:04:13.860> might<00:04:14.010> have<00:04:14.250> no

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
for those children who might have no

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.870 
for those children who might have no
access<00:04:14.910> at<00:04:14.940> all

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
access at all

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.780 
access at all
I<00:04:22.750> think<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.290> impact<00:04:24.770> on<00:04:25.010> students<00:04:25.640> has

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
I think the impact on students has

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.300 
I think the impact on students has
mostly<00:04:26.270> been<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.900> they<00:04:27.110> think<00:04:28.010> about

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
mostly been that they think about

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.250 
mostly been that they think about
opportunities<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.420> way<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:29.960> didn't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
opportunities in a way that they didn't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.590 
opportunities in a way that they didn't
before<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.700> again<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.090> is<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> very

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
before and again this is a very

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.770 
before and again this is a very
difficult<00:04:32.960> one<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:34.460> be<00:04:35.000> precise<00:04:35.540> about

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
difficult one to to be precise about

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.460 
difficult one to to be precise about
what<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.290> impact<00:04:36.650> is<00:04:36.860> but<00:04:37.780> previously<00:04:38.780> music

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
what the impact is but previously music

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.290 
what the impact is but previously music
was<00:04:39.620> something<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.580> did<00:04:40.790> if<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.060> took

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
was something that you did if you took

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.830 
was something that you did if you took
music<00:04:41.960> lessons<00:04:42.700> outside<00:04:43.700> school<00:04:44.540> or<00:04:44.720> in

music lessons outside school or in

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.600 
music lessons outside school or in
school<00:04:45.110> if<00:04:45.260> you<00:04:45.350> did<00:04:45.590> peripatetic<00:04:46.280> music

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
school if you did peripatetic music

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.920 
school if you did peripatetic music
lessons<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.870> was<00:04:48.020> very<00:04:48.200> restricted<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.250> a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
lessons and it was very restricted to a

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.720 
lessons and it was very restricted to a
relatively<00:04:50.930> narrow<00:04:51.200> group<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.560> girls<00:04:51.770> now

relatively narrow group of girls now

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.690 
relatively narrow group of girls now
music<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.750> reaching<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> far<00:04:54.920> wider<00:04:55.190> group<00:04:55.520> of

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
music is reaching a far wider group of

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.960 
music is reaching a far wider group of
students<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.360> students<00:04:57.020> are<00:04:57.140> looking<00:04:57.320> at

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
students and students are looking at

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.040 
students and students are looking at
opportunities<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.450> actually<00:04:59.810> stepping

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
opportunities and actually stepping

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.770 
opportunities and actually stepping
forward<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.650> take<00:05:00.830> heart<00:05:01.070> in<00:05:01.340> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
forward to take heart in the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.730 
forward to take heart in the
extracurricular<00:05:02.780> program<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.350> greater

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
extracurricular program in greater

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.240 
extracurricular program in greater
numbers<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:05.450> workshops<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.410> school<00:05:06.770> also

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
numbers the workshops in school also

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.220 
numbers the workshops in school also
obviously<00:05:08.060> reach<00:05:08.360> students<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.050> wider

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
obviously reach students and wider

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.710 
obviously reach students and wider
numbers<00:05:09.770> but<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.280> think<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.700> greatest<00:05:11.000> impact

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
numbers but I think the greatest impact

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.560 
numbers but I think the greatest impact
is<00:05:12.080> probably<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:12.710> their<00:05:12.920> music<00:05:13.280> lessons<00:05:13.910> where

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
is probably in their music lessons where

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.200 
is probably in their music lessons where
music<00:05:14.840> has<00:05:15.200> become<00:05:15.380> much<00:05:16.070> more<00:05:16.280> engaging<00:05:16.640> much

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
music has become much more engaging much

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.070 
music has become much more engaging much
more<00:05:17.450> active<00:05:17.990> much<00:05:18.620> more<00:05:18.920> about<00:05:19.810> being<00:05:20.810> a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
more active much more about being a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.170 
more active much more about being a
musician<00:05:21.290> rather<00:05:21.920> than<00:05:22.160> passively<00:05:22.820> being

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
musician rather than passively being

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.330 
musician rather than passively being
taught<00:05:23.600> music<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.590> think<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:25.010> would<00:05:25.190> be

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
taught music and I think that would be

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.770 
taught music and I think that would be
the<00:05:25.460> greatest<00:05:25.910> impact<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.420> course<00:05:26.600> that's

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
the greatest impact of course that's

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.530 
the greatest impact of course that's
every<00:05:27.290> single<00:05:27.440> student<00:05:27.890> in<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.970> school<00:05:29.270> and

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
every single student in the school and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.710 
every single student in the school and
the<00:05:30.530> technology<00:05:31.310> has<00:05:31.460> helped<00:05:31.820> because<00:05:32.030> if<00:05:32.570> you

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
the technology has helped because if you

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.330 
the technology has helped because if you
can't<00:05:32.930> play<00:05:33.140> an<00:05:33.200> instrument<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:33.770> can<00:05:33.950> use<00:05:34.130> the

can't play an instrument you can use the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.180 
can't play an instrument you can use the
