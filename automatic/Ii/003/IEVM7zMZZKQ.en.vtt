00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
here is being painted on whereas in the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.890 
here is being painted on whereas in the
original<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.580> could

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
original one you could

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.380 
original one you could
to<00:02:12.049> see<00:02:12.560> his<00:02:12.769> full-size<00:02:13.310> jetpack<00:02:13.819> on<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.239> back
