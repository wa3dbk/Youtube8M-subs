the<00:00:39.380> lid<00:00:39.820> gutted<00:00:40.820> about<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.600> went<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the lid gutted about it so I went in the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.240 
the lid gutted about it so I went in the
Apple<00:00:42.290> store<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:44.950> asked<00:00:45.950> how<00:00:46.040> much<00:00:46.190> it

Apple store and I asked how much it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.430 
Apple store and I asked how much it
would<00:00:46.489> cost<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.910> replace<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.600> aluminium<00:00:47.930> lid

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
would cost to replace the aluminium lid

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.529 
would cost to replace the aluminium lid
and<00:00:49.190> they<00:00:49.340> said<00:00:49.610> they<00:00:49.760> can't<00:00:49.969> just<00:00:50.210> do<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
and they said they can't just do the

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.869 
and they said they can't just do the
lead<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:51.350> would<00:00:51.500> have<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:51.829> be<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.700> whole

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
lead it would have to be the whole

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.850 
lead it would have to be the whole
screen<00:00:53.210> which<00:00:53.899> would<00:00:54.079> come<00:00:54.260> pretty<00:00:54.530> much

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
screen which would come pretty much

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.970 
screen which would come pretty much
pretty<00:00:55.760> much<00:00:55.879> to<00:00:56.239> about<00:00:56.510> 300<00:00:57.079> quid<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.739> do<00:00:57.860> it

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
pretty much to about 300 quid to do it

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.779 
pretty much to about 300 quid to do it
and<00:00:58.809> as<00:00:59.809> much<00:01:00.050> as<00:01:00.110> I<00:01:00.260> hate<00:01:00.530> seeing<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.129> then<00:01:01.309> a

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
and as much as I hate seeing that then a

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.329 
and as much as I hate seeing that then a
little<00:01:02.600> work<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:03.620> finally<00:01:03.920> looking<00:01:04.070> chip

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
little work that's finally looking chip

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.710 
little work that's finally looking chip
out<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:05.920> don't<00:01:07.000> think<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.210> bad<00:01:08.510> to

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
out of it I don't think it's that bad to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.980 
out of it I don't think it's that bad to
warn<00:01:09.460> like<00:01:10.460> friends<00:01:10.909> or<00:01:10.939> not<00:01:11.060> quit<00:01:11.299> spins<00:01:11.869> on

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
warn like friends or not quit spins on

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.710 
warn like friends or not quit spins on
it<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.680> what<00:01:13.070> I've<00:01:13.189> done<00:01:13.340> just<00:01:13.760> thinking<00:01:14.510> about

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
it so what I've done just thinking about

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.830 
it so what I've done just thinking about
what<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.140> do<00:01:15.760> they<00:01:16.760> do<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.090> case<00:01:17.330> like<00:01:17.810> a

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
what to do they do this case like a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.929 
what to do they do this case like a
plastic<00:01:18.380> case<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.770> can<00:01:18.890> pover<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.580> think

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
plastic case you can pover it I think

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.580 
plastic case you can pover it I think
it's<00:01:20.090> spec<00:01:20.830> they<00:01:21.830> make<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.040> blocker<00:01:22.640> case<00:01:22.939> but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
it's spec they make a blocker case but

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969 
it's spec they make a blocker case but
with<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.580> means<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:25.970> can't<00:01:26.240> use<00:01:26.330> my<00:01:26.979> zip

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
with that it means I can't use my zip

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.700 
with that it means I can't use my zip
upper<00:01:28.159> case<00:01:28.939> type<00:01:29.180> over<00:01:29.659> which<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.290> open

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
upper case type over which is this open

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.760 
upper case type over which is this open
set<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.939> case<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:33.110> normally<00:01:33.590> use

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
set this is the case that I normally use

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.660 
set this is the case that I normally use
to<00:01:34.930> put<00:01:35.930> them<00:01:36.020> up<00:01:36.079> in<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.409> macking<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.369> all

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
to put them up in the macking and all

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.120 
to put them up in the macking and all
this<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.240> edge<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:39.049> metal<00:01:39.530> rigid

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
this the edge of this is metal rigid

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.940 
this the edge of this is metal rigid
metal<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.869> like<00:01:42.079> almost<00:01:42.680> like<00:01:42.890> a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
metal and this is like almost like a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.389 
metal and this is like almost like a
memory<00:01:43.310> foam<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.720> lot<00:01:44.930> more<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.350> lot<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:46.009> so

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
memory foam but a lot more a lot then so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.030 
memory foam but a lot more a lot then so
obviously<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.240> took<00:01:47.390> an<00:01:47.570> impact<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.860> hit

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
obviously it took an impact and you hit

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.120 
obviously it took an impact and you hit
it<00:01:49.189> hard<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.610> kind<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.909> tenses<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:51.130> then

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it hard and it kind of tenses up then

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.960 
it hard and it kind of tenses up then
you<00:01:52.250> slowly<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.090> think<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.479> pushes<00:01:54.079> into<00:01:54.229> it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
you slowly you think it pushes into it

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.850 
you slowly you think it pushes into it

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
with it I'll just post it and see what

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.300 
with it I'll just post it and see what
you<00:02:56.560> think<00:02:56.709> okay<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.819> now<00:02:58.719> put<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.219> it<00:03:00.219> was

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
you think okay and now put it on it was

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.709 
you think okay and now put it on it was
a<00:03:00.370> bit<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.639> bitch<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:01.299> do<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.969> I<00:03:04.239> thought

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
a bit of a bitch to do in the I thought

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.409 
a bit of a bitch to do in the I thought
scent<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.439> Apple<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.010> then<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:07.180> rest

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
scent of the Apple and then the rest

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.679 
scent of the Apple and then the rest
would<00:03:07.569> be<00:03:07.629> fine<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.319> it's<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.450> you've<00:03:10.450> got<00:03:10.599> to

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
would be fine but it's so you've got to

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.119 
would be fine but it's so you've got to
be<00:03:10.750> really<00:03:11.019> careful<00:03:11.200> because<00:03:11.590> if<00:03:12.010> you're

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
be really careful because if you're

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.729 
be really careful because if you're
putting<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.579> on<00:03:12.939> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.930> only<00:03:14.049> be<00:03:14.260> slightly

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
putting it on you can only be slightly

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.140 
putting it on you can only be slightly
yeah<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.189> obviously<00:03:15.250> if<00:03:15.730> you're<00:03:15.879> slightly

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
yeah and obviously if you're slightly

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.180 
yeah and obviously if you're slightly
out<00:03:16.359> here<00:03:16.599> that's<00:03:17.349> going<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> multiply<00:03:17.979> for

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
out here that's going to multiply for

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.369 
out here that's going to multiply for
the<00:03:18.250> time<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.519> get<00:03:18.639> here<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.690> what<00:03:19.870> did<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.199> just

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
the time we get here so what did I just

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.860 
the time we get here so what did I just
messed<00:03:20.620> up<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:21.790> corn<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> as<00:03:22.299> best<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.659> could

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
messed up the corn is as best I could

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.509 
messed up the corn is as best I could
and<00:03:23.139> then<00:03:24.069> laid<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.669> across<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:26.159> it's<00:03:27.159> come<00:03:27.340> up

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
and then laid it across and it's come up

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.409 
and then laid it across and it's come up
quite<00:03:28.510> well<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:30.069> edge<00:03:30.189> is<00:03:30.239> not<00:03:31.239> that

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
quite well and the edge is not that

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:31.830 
quite well and the edge is not that
impressive

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
impressive

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.020 
impressive
we<00:03:32.699> don't<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:33.849> H<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.150> okay<00:03:35.459> first<00:03:36.459> light<00:03:36.639> here

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
we don't that H is okay first light here

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.349 
we don't that H is okay first light here
there's<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.329> bigger<00:03:37.599> gap<00:03:38.939> running<00:03:39.939> over<00:03:40.150> here

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
there's a bigger gap running over here

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.509 
there's a bigger gap running over here
and<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.569> is<00:03:40.689> slightly<00:03:40.930> thinner<00:03:41.739> but<00:03:42.159> not<00:03:42.340> too

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
and it is slightly thinner but not too

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.129 
and it is slightly thinner but not too
much<00:03:42.699> sheep<00:03:42.909> unless<00:03:43.509> you<00:03:43.659> start<00:03:43.840> looking

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
much sheep unless you start looking

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.879 
much sheep unless you start looking
loads<00:03:45.069> you<00:03:45.340> probably<00:03:45.609> see<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:46.259> but<00:03:47.259> the

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
loads you probably see it but the

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:55.439 
loads you probably see it but the
coolness<00:03:48.159> the<00:03:48.639> same<00:03:48.849> very<00:03:49.060> tight<00:03:54.269> if<00:03:55.269> it's

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
coolness the same very tight if it's

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.300 
coolness the same very tight if it's
here<00:03:55.689> the<00:03:56.049> fonts<00:03:56.439> a<00:03:56.650> lot<00:03:56.799> better<00:03:56.979> than<00:03:57.159> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
here the fonts a lot better than the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.399 
here the fonts a lot better than the
back<00:03:59.340> it's<00:04:00.340> quite<00:04:00.519> even<00:04:00.849> once<00:04:01.479> every<00:04:01.629> even<00:04:02.109> but

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
back it's quite even once every even but

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.319 
back it's quite even once every even but
I'm<00:04:02.500> not<00:04:02.620> too<00:04:02.739> sure<00:04:02.889> about<00:04:02.919> cut<00:04:03.370> because<00:04:04.120> it's

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
I'm not too sure about cut because it's

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.129 
I'm not too sure about cut because it's
slightly<00:04:04.659> different<00:04:04.930> here<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.909> then<00:04:07.269> sort<00:04:08.079> of

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
slightly different here and then sort of

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.349 
slightly different here and then sort of
take<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:09.189> off<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.729> the<00:04:09.970> apples<00:04:10.329> perfect<00:04:10.780> so

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
take this off but the apples perfect so

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.279 
take this off but the apples perfect so
usual<00:04:13.359> but<00:04:14.109> I've<00:04:14.379> tried<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.680> back<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:16.169> two<00:04:17.169> or

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
usual but I've tried it back and two or

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.560 
usual but I've tried it back and two or
three<00:04:17.440> times<00:04:17.680> pulled<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.400> up<00:04:18.459> slightly<00:04:18.729> but

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
three times pulled it up slightly but

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.120 
three times pulled it up slightly but
just<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.900> show<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.079> what<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.500> looks<00:04:20.650> like

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.960 

saison<00:04:24.790> sound-alike<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.730> looks<00:04:30.910> pretty

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
saison sound-alike so it looks pretty

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.170 
saison sound-alike so it looks pretty
fat<00:04:31.390> on<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:32.230> yeah<00:04:32.590> if<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.800> Thunder

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
fat on it so yeah if you Thunder

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.110 
fat on it so yeah if you Thunder
obviously<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.690> can't<00:04:34.900> see<00:04:35.050> any<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.820> event

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
obviously you can't see any of the event
