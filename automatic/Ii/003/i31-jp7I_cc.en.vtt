00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
main foyer of the house and then you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
main foyer of the house and then you
look<00:00:44.100> around<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.059> church<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> look

look around the church and then you look
at<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> more<00:00:47.850> fanciful<00:00:48.690> graves<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
at the the more fanciful graves to the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
at the the more fanciful graves to the
left<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> church<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> you'll<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
left of the church and you'll see that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.010 
left of the church and you'll see that
the<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> Left<00:00:52.649> says<00:00:53.539> Wilfred<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the one on the Left says Wilfred and so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
the one on the Left says Wilfred and so
that's<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.129> his<00:00:56.309> name<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that's what I think that his name was is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.799 
that's what I think that his name was is
that<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.390> guy<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.559> called<00:00:58.859> Wilfred<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.809> he

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that the guy was called Wilfred and he

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.470 
that the guy was called Wilfred and he
died<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:01.859> happened<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.399> she<00:01:03.000> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
died and then what happened was she was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
died and then what happened was she was
overcome<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.899> grief<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.559> why<00:01:04.710> she

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
overcome with grief and that's why she

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
overcome with grief and that's why she
is<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:06.860> like<00:01:07.860> black<00:01:08.790> dress<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
is in like black dress and all that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
is in like black dress and all that
stuff<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.799> she<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.189> probably<00:01:12.119> attending

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
stuff because she was probably attending

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.580 
stuff because she was probably attending
at<00:01:12.780> his<00:01:13.020> funeral

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
at his funeral

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.359 
at his funeral
and<00:01:14.330> probably<00:01:15.330> soon<00:01:15.570> after<00:01:16.110> she<00:01:16.710> probably

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and probably soon after she probably

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
and probably soon after she probably
killed<00:01:17.729> herself<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.140> was

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
killed herself just because he was

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
killed herself just because he was
overcome<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:19.979> grief<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.580> she

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
overcome with so much grief and then she

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.410 
overcome with so much grief and then she
became<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> ghost<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> house<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.420> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
became the ghost of the house and is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.609 
became the ghost of the house and is
actually<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.840> interesting<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
actually really interesting because if

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.990 
actually really interesting because if
you<00:01:25.650> look<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.159> she's<00:01:26.430> actually<00:01:26.610> playing

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you look at when she's actually playing

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
you look at when she's actually playing
the<00:01:27.119> piano<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.600> we'll<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> video<00:01:28.080> on

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the piano which we'll have a video on

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
the piano which we'll have a video on
very<00:01:28.619> soon<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.299> clearly<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.900> tears

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
very soon you can very clearly see tears

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.609 
very soon you can very clearly see tears
in<00:01:31.439> her<00:01:31.770> eyes<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.110> think<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.320> one

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
in her eyes and so I think that one

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
in her eyes and so I think that one
thing<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> she<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.490> during<00:01:35.880> her

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
thing that she actually was during her

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
thing that she actually was during her
lifetime<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.750> she<00:01:36.960> did<00:01:37.829> actually<00:01:38.100> play

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
lifetime was that she did actually play

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
lifetime was that she did actually play
the<00:01:38.400> piano<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> saloon<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> probably<00:01:39.869> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the piano in the saloon and probably I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
the piano in the saloon and probably I
wouldn't<00:01:40.979> say<00:01:41.100> work<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.820> because

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
wouldn't say work there because

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
wouldn't say work there because
obviously<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:42.899> mansion<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.710> don't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
obviously it's a big mansion so I don't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
obviously it's a big mansion so I don't
think<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.189> she<00:01:44.369> particularly<00:01:45.060> worked<00:01:45.390> but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
think that she particularly worked but

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310 
think that she particularly worked but
maybe<00:01:45.750> Wilfred<00:01:46.619> own<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.310> saloon<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:48.229> some<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
maybe Wilfred own the saloon or some of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770 
maybe Wilfred own the saloon or some of
the<00:01:49.380> places<00:01:49.560> around<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.040> town<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.549> um<00:01:50.820> that's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the places around the town but um that's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
the places around the town but um that's
pretty<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> story<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> ghost<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pretty much the story of the ghost as I

thoughts in the comment section about

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.590 
thoughts in the comment section about
what<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> story<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.360> ghost

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
what you think the story of this ghost

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.889 
what you think the story of this ghost
is<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> side<00:02:05.820> note<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.450> big<00:02:06.630> guy

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
is and just as a side note the big guy

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.260 
is and just as a side note the big guy
has<00:02:07.170> no<00:02:07.469> particular<00:02:07.890> story<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.119> he

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
has no particular story to him at all he

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.490 
has no particular story to him at all he
was<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:09.599> late<00:02:09.810> addition<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.590> game

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
was a very late addition to the game

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.750 
was a very late addition to the game
and<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:11.920> he<00:02:11.980> doesn't<00:02:12.160> really<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.340> too<00:02:12.640> much

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and so he doesn't really have too much

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.000 
and so he doesn't really have too much
backstory<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.540> he<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:14.050> very<00:02:14.230> useful<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
backstory but he is very very useful and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.170 
backstory but he is very very useful and
effective<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.730> whole<00:02:15.880> now<00:02:16.030> he's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
effective in this whole now he's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.800 
effective in this whole now he's
probably<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.540> best<00:02:16.570> addition<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.800> terms<00:02:18.190> of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
probably the best addition in terms of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.410 
probably the best addition in terms of
you<00:02:19.810> know<00:02:19.960> all<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.590> new<00:02:21.400> features<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
wasn't even the zombie team's idea is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.230 
wasn't even the zombie team's idea is
one<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> whole<00:02:24.430> idea<00:02:24.730> which<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:24.910> interesting
