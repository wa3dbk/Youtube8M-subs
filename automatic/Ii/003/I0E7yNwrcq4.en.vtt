00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
access to the stupid fairy code I learn

a lot of those Slayer areas are actually

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.490 
a lot of those Slayer areas are actually
very<00:05:16.240> close<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.480> the<00:05:16.600> fairy<00:05:16.840> code<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:17.260> I<00:05:17.290> make

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
very close to the fairy code so I make

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.900 
very close to the fairy code so I make
kind<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.740> make<00:05:17.860> sense<00:05:18.070> instead<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.670> running

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
kind of make sense instead of running

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.900 
kind of make sense instead of running
all<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.210> way<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.390> like<00:05:20.190> relic<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.340> dungeon<00:05:21.760> from

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
Lumbridge time I ran from lumbridge to

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.740 
Lumbridge time I ran from lumbridge to
Fowley<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.280> it's<00:05:27.400> just<00:05:27.520> retarded<00:05:27.790> and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
Fowley to like it's just retarded and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.420 
Fowley to like it's just retarded and
then<00:05:28.870> after<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.170> apply<00:05:29.290> working<00:05:29.740> getting<00:05:29.890> 37

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
then after that apply working getting 37

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.010 
then after that apply working getting 37
magic<00:05:30.760> just<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:30.970> I<00:05:31.000> can<00:05:31.060> teleport<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.570> fali<00:05:31.840> as

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
magic just so I can teleport to fali as

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.270 
magic just so I can teleport to fali as
well<00:05:32.200> that's<00:05:32.350> kind<00:05:32.530> of<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.620> next<00:05:32.770> little<00:05:33.010> goal

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
well that's kind of the next little goal

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.980 
well that's kind of the next little goal
for<00:05:34.000> the<00:05:34.060> constant<00:05:34.390> of<00:05:34.420> money<00:05:34.600> though<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.750> guess

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
for the constant of money though I guess

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.930 
for the constant of money though I guess
