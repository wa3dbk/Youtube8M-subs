00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.930
 the terrain module of elite cad 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.740
 understands numeric lists of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.300
 score points files 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 interpret three-dimensionally and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.000
 the result in a parametric 3d 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.310
 model 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.820
 this terrain can now be considered 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 become 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.210
 pay attention to the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.849
 corresponding height lines in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 terrain and we 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.700
 can manipulate this terrain 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.790
 I give a spline curve to the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.430
 is now placed in this terrain and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.690
 with the help of which I later the terrain 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.690
 also can manipulate 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 then i will also load cadastral data 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.149
 to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.210
 the terrain is not always data 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.969
 identical to the lot data here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.280
 We have a cadastral copy about it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.980
 loaded and there is a functionality 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.620
 with which I now the outline of the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 property can repair 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 just this size now available 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250
 to have 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.690
 Now the volume of the terrain fixes something 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.570
 means as much as that 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.170
 borderlines are fixed in their height 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.510
 then at later manipulation 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.500
 not the neighbors plot too 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.720
 manipulate 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.479
 Now I have the excavation plan 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.700
 loaded because I use now in this 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.630
 terrain modules by tapping the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 polygon I can here and the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.899
 The angle of descent was also defined by the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.899
 possibility at the bottom of the excavation 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.539
 indicate that I am here now with 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:54.560
 confirm the direction and immediately 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.920
 arises a corresponding excavation the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.630
 The cubature of this excavation is above 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.460
 You can see them here 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 this 239 cubic meters exclaim 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.610
 I would like now on the property 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.120
 distribute to this at 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.070
 manipulation line 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.250
 but I also have the opportunity through 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.560
 add precise points and situations 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.299
 so the excavation on the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.299
 land again to deposit 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.220
 Now I'll create a stone for me 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.500
 History of a street gives this 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.690
 but have this course 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 Taking the course of your time again 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.960
 can correct and then get one 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.310
 but from rounded curve now if i 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.560
 this polygon to make it a way 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.570
 to calculate a street 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 I can do that with this functionality 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.950
 course at and descent angle of the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.850
 orders respectively distribution 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.550
 manipulate 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.040
 but I also have the possibility this 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.160
 to correct the course of the line at any time 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.500
 and now this street will be new again 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.360
 the terrain miscalculated with this 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.460
 Functionality can be very subtle 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.220
 Build roads and roads 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.700
 it is also possible at any time 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.860
 to attack this excavation again 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.590
 take for example here for one 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.260
 Garage access is easy 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.890
 to the corresponding Handel to accomplish this 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.950
 regulate 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.000
 the terrain is always available 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.100
 of course, there can be three dimensions 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.739
 match the floor plans 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.959
 and views are mapped or in 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.390
 the representation can, for example, the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.150
 excavation also be visualized 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.610
 they will be specially crafted 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.790
 of functionality supports the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.160
 For example, a proven part always 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.160
 to the surface of the terrain 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.010
 also when changing the terrain heights 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.250
 follow these library parts of the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.989
 surface of the terrain next to this 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.500
 property I now generate by a 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.180
 Polygon I give a tennis court 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.550
 three points 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.450
 around this area of ​​the square too 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.690
 define 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.280
 after these points in their high 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.080
 values ​​were set to the polygon 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.989
 the space is automatically integrated into 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.650
 the three-dimensional terrain that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.630
 digital terrain model by elite cad 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.419
 supports you optimally in the planning 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.120
 Complex construction helps you with this 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.910
 optimally adapted to the terrain and 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.080
 provides you with all the possibilities 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.300
 the object presentation and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.300
 Illustration in associated plans
