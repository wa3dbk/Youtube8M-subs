today<00:00:32.290> we're<00:00:32.470> going<00:00:32.560> to<00:00:32.650> be<00:00:32.770> talking<00:00:32.980> about

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180 
today we're going to be talking about
celli<00:00:34.000> Spader<00:00:34.480> which<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.380> an<00:00:35.530> implement<00:00:35.950> from

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
celli Spader which is an implement from

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.930 
celli Spader which is an implement from
italy<00:00:36.850> it's<00:00:37.450> designed<00:00:37.900> for<00:00:38.200> a<00:00:39.070> primary<00:00:39.550> and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
italy it's designed for a primary and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.119 
italy it's designed for a primary and
secondary<00:00:40.180> tillage<00:00:40.809> and<00:00:41.020> it's<00:00:41.500> considered<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
secondary tillage and it's considered a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.060 
secondary tillage and it's considered a
conservation<00:00:42.879> tillage<00:00:43.090> tool<00:00:43.570> because<00:00:44.470> it<00:00:44.829> is

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
conservation tillage tool because it is

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.610 
conservation tillage tool because it is
much<00:00:45.430> easier<00:00:45.730> on<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.449> soil<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:47.080> don't<00:00:47.110> end<00:00:47.440> up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
much easier on the soil you don't end up

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.770 
much easier on the soil you don't end up
with<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.830> compaction<00:00:48.309> layer<00:00:48.519> because<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.690> the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
with a compaction layer because of the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.290 
with a compaction layer because of the
way<00:00:49.930> that<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.470> fills<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.100> soil<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.940> way<00:00:55.089> that

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
way that it fills the soil the way that

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.060 
way that it fills the soil the way that
the<00:00:55.420> Spader<00:00:55.690> works<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.620> series<00:00:57.040> of

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
the Spader works is it's a series of

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.479 
the Spader works is it's a series of
these<00:00:57.370> small<00:00:57.760> spades<00:00:58.690> or<00:00:58.989> shovels<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.860> are

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
these small spades or shovels that are

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.820 
these small spades or shovels that are
mounted<00:01:00.940> on<00:01:01.089> an<00:01:01.269> eccentric<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.199> instead<00:01:02.620> of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
mounted on an eccentric so instead of

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.039 
mounted on an eccentric so instead of
spinning<00:01:03.610> like<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> roto<00:01:04.390> tiller<00:01:04.659> they

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
spinning like a roto tiller they

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.370 
spinning like a roto tiller they
actually<00:01:05.530> just<00:01:06.190> pivot<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.930> Spade

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
actually just pivot and it the Spade

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.380 
actually just pivot and it the Spade
will<00:01:08.650> take<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> bite<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.190> soil<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.970> then<00:01:10.060> kick

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
will take a bite of soil and then kick

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.520 
will take a bite of soil and then kick
it<00:01:10.420> back<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:11.229> this<00:01:11.380> flap<00:01:11.770> where<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.670> shatters

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.380 

and<00:01:17.860> you're<00:01:18.010> setting<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.640> up<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.180> really

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and you're setting this up it's really

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.290 
and you're setting this up it's really
important<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.770> Spader<00:01:21.070> be<00:01:21.400> level<00:01:21.940> from

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
important that the Spader be level from

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.390 
important that the Spader be level from
side<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.600> side<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.560> then<00:01:24.040> it's<00:01:24.190> also

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
side to side and then it's also

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.280 
side to side and then it's also
important<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.420> have<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.900> tilt

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
important that you have the tilt

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.830 
important that you have the tilt
adjusted<00:01:26.920> with<00:01:27.130> your<00:01:27.310> tap<00:01:27.550> link<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.480> that<00:01:28.690> your

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
adjusted with your tap link so that your

up<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.570> little<00:02:31.720> bit<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.500> Spader<00:02:32.769> is

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
up a little bit so that the Spader is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.190
