fitzgerald<00:02:40.170> vs<00:02:40.590> Miami<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.310> Miami

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
fitzgerald vs Miami you know Miami

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.550 
fitzgerald vs Miami you know Miami
doesn't<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.420> great<00:02:42.659> of<00:02:42.780> corners<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.379> I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
doesn't have that great of corners so I

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.649 
doesn't have that great of corners so I
think<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.280> passing<00:02:44.670> game<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:45.030> Arizona<00:02:45.420> will

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
think the passing game for Arizona will

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.470 
think the passing game for Arizona will
work<00:02:45.870> well<00:02:46.079> against<00:02:46.409> Miami<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.010> last<00:02:47.519> has<00:02:48.209> two

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
Garcia has got a sprained ankle so you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.530 
Garcia has got a sprained ankle so you
