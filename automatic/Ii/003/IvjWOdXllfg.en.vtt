00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.969
 good morning princesses good morning a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.680
 all good morning everyone new video e 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.430
 today I would like to inaugurate a new one 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 category of video a new section if 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
 so we want to call instead 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.420
 let's put together the anguish comb 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.850
 together so maybe I could make it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 together some hairstyle always 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.820
 chatting freely without doing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 videos too heavy as I say 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.769
 and today I want to let you see how 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 I make myself and hair wavy with this 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.780
 iron in any iron to curl 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 hair and I know only crazy 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 would decide to make such a video 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.890
 when it's 30 degrees outside but I think 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.079
 to be crazy 15 no problem 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.640
 outside it's really hot till 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.829
 a short time ago and or up to a few minutes 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 ago I was here with the ball fan 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.420
 but decided to move it because otherwise 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.309
 this case would have made me flutter 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 all the hair so you wouldn't have 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.440
 understood nothing a tube first thing 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'm going to comb my hair with this one 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:17.909
 brush I feel pretty crazy 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.590
 today ok so we remove all the nodes is 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.070
 very important 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.939
 meanwhile I go turn on my iron this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's babyliss is called sublim touch e 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.189
 I put it at the highest temperature ie 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.830
 180 degrees 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 then I go to use a spray that is 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.140
 the must for me to do wavy hair 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.049
 this is of tones in gae and is found from 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 here soap this more or less from 8 to 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.650
 10 euros 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 it's called si soldo and texture aisin spray 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.350
 then to a salt-based solution 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.950
 that from a bit of natural volume i 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.409
 hair then a little that effect 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.970
 that you have when you come out of the sea 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.579
 and and therefore with the salt water of from a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.729
 bit quell blur a bit ruffled 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.590
 let's say i'm going to exploit it on tilt i 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.660
 hair do not abuse that this product 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.700
 because in any case being based on salt 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 it doesn't really do well 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 here to the hair so do not overdo it I go 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.890
 to comb again so that the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.140
 product is distributed well over all 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.760
 the lengths and probably this 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.959
 video made a little more sense when i 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.319
 longer hair 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.610
 now that they are so short maybe 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.800
 the effect is not the same but I have to 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.330
 to be honest I prefer it I prefer 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.980
 to do wavy hair when I'm like this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.640
 short because they will have more effect 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.370
 carefree of the very cute so I go 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.370
 to take a lock not too small 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.459
 but not too big and I go to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.260
 roll it over my iron or 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.980
 curling iron in short, call it how 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.989
 want 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.239
 so I'm not going to roll it up 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.790
 inside I don't like the effect but I go 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.670
 simply roll it over this 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.819
 way will give a more natural effect more 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.819
 more cheeky hi mom 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.330
 she does not know that I will put it on youtube 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.710
 et voila 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.600
 after really a few seconds this 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.430
 is the result now you see it that way 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.380
 very defined but in a moment yes yes 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.220
 it will collapse and therefore it will not be really 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.630
 so 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.430
 if you want a less defined effect 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 go get a bigger lock 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.460
 and continue until stocks are exhausted 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.080
 your hair 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.840
 you see that however the effect is very much 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.340
 natural is a very natural place 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.340
 now I also pass to the other side 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.750
 tell us but also if you use them 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.690
 some products in particular to do 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.430
 wavy hair tips are always well 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.050
 accept or with this Italy in the race mi 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.170
 I really like it very much 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.720
 very much and maybe even used the 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.250
 day later very often when when 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.870
 you make wavy hair 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.580
 the next day or at least what 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.290
 it happens to me that the next day is not there 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.810
 nothing more so the hair is back 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.880
 again smooth with this instead I go to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.920
 spray it a little on the lengths i 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.170
 hair come back volume duty again 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.140
 so I do not say that it is like when there 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.450
 do however added up not having a whole lot 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.940
 volume in a bit of a tone that I like 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.530
 this is also why this product 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.630
 I'm almost done and I'm dying of heat 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.480
 it's too hot outside too too much 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.970
 hot summer arrived and I'm happy 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.070
 but the shoah is really hot 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.100
 that we're done now have fun 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.660
 bit to mess up there to leave you some 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.050
 broken down just like when you go to 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.550
 sea ​​that are all disheveled now 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.220
 worth to spray a lot of lacquer 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:33.360
 this is the black head one the palette 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.360
 holden flex that held to doors then 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.360
 ok 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.190
 and this is the end result I hope 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.230
 you liked this video there was a 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.780
 little bit useful if you have any ideas 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.970
 for some hairstyle or combing 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.410
 particularly write me below and 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.040
