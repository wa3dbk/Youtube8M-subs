that<00:04:15.000> sharpness<00:04:15.569> said<00:04:15.959> he<00:04:16.139> needs<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.829> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
that sharpness said he needs over the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.680 
that sharpness said he needs over the
next<00:04:17.130> six<00:04:17.370> weeks<00:04:17.549> he's<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.299> Colorado

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
next six weeks he's going to Colorado

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.710 
next six weeks he's going to Colorado
Springs<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:20.220> tell<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.820> Olympic<00:04:21.180> Trials<00:04:21.570> he's

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
Springs and tell the Olympic Trials he's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.540 
Springs and tell the Olympic Trials he's
heading<00:04:22.019> out<00:04:22.139> to<00:04:22.320> altitude<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:23.009> train<00:04:23.310> there

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
heading out to altitude to train there

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.570 
heading out to altitude to train there
so<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.030> think<00:04:24.509> that<00:04:24.960> will<00:04:25.169> come<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.889> intend

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
so I think that will come and and intend

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.189 
so I think that will come and and intend
to<00:04:26.669> tell<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:26.970> truth<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.419> don't<00:04:27.720> think<00:04:28.020> this

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
to tell you the truth I don't think this

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.260 
to tell you the truth I don't think this
is<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.380> bad<00:04:28.590> thing<00:04:28.650> him<00:04:29.070> bad<00:04:29.400> thing<00:04:29.699> him<00:04:29.850> losing

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
is a bad thing him bad thing him losing

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.140 
is a bad thing him bad thing him losing
this<00:04:30.389> race<00:04:30.509> right<00:04:30.870> now<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.370> think<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:32.849> is

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
this race right now I think this is

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.629 
this race right now I think this is
motivates<00:04:33.750> him<00:04:33.900> Michael<00:04:34.320> once<00:04:34.530> again<00:04:34.860> hates

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
motivates him Michael once again hates

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.909 
motivates him Michael once again hates
to<00:04:35.970> lose<00:04:36.180> more<00:04:36.570> than<00:04:36.810> he<00:04:36.900> likes<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.380> win<00:04:37.560> so

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
to lose more than he likes to win so

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.710 
to lose more than he likes to win so
when<00:04:38.460> he<00:04:38.550> gets<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.000> point<00:04:39.270> even<00:04:39.449> in<00:04:39.630> a

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
when he gets to this point even in a

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.360 
when he gets to this point even in a
meet<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:40.380> at<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.740> hunter<00:04:41.009> turret<00:04:41.340> you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
meet like this at the hunter turret you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.129 
meet like this at the hunter turret you
can<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:41.699> he<00:04:41.849> looked<00:04:42.060> he<00:04:42.570> looked<00:04:42.750> pretty<00:04:42.870> good

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
can see he looked he looked pretty good

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.020 
can see he looked he looked pretty good
on<00:04:43.199> that<00:04:43.470> turn<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.860> was<00:04:43.979> his<00:04:44.160> first<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.759> third

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
on that turn it was his first and third

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.550 
on that turn it was his first and third
turn<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.539> he<00:04:45.630> kind<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.960> jammed<00:04:46.259> here's<00:04:46.500> a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
turn that he kind of jammed here's a

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.960 
turn that he kind of jammed here's a
third<00:04:46.830> that's<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.130> turn<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.520> there<00:04:47.729> that<00:04:47.910> he

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
third that's a turn right there that he

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.760 
third that's a turn right there that he
jammed<00:04:48.330> right<00:04:48.750> there<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.199> it<00:04:49.289> just<00:04:49.320> didn't

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
jammed right there and it just didn't

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.890 
jammed right there and it just didn't
look<00:04:49.800> good<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.400> then<00:04:50.940> when<00:04:51.210> when<00:04:51.449> you<00:04:51.539> jam

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
look good and then when when you jam

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.990 
look good and then when when you jam
that<00:04:52.110> turn<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.830> yet<00:04:53.370> it's<00:04:53.550> hard<00:04:53.820> to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
that turn like that yet it's hard to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.240 
that turn like that yet it's hard to
develop<00:04:54.270> momentum<00:04:55.110> coming<00:04:55.500> off<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> wall<00:04:55.949> and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
develop momentum coming off the wall and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.950 
develop momentum coming off the wall and
that's<00:04:56.729> where<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.060> go<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.360> fastest<00:04:57.810> and

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
that's where you go the fastest and

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.570 
that's where you go the fastest and
that's<00:04:58.110> where<00:04:58.320> Michael<00:04:58.800> goes<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.130> fastest

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
that's where Michael goes the fastest

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.460 
that's where Michael goes the fastest
the<00:04:59.699> wall<00:04:59.880> punk<00:05:00.180> took<00:05:00.690> advantage<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:01.380> that

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
the wall punk took advantage of that

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.770 
the wall punk took advantage of that
because<00:05:01.650> he<00:05:01.979> nailed<00:05:02.310> all<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:02.880> his<00:05:03.060> turns<00:05:03.389> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
because he nailed all of his turns and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.409 
because he nailed all of his turns and
that<00:05:04.470> momentum<00:05:05.010> that<00:05:05.280> he<00:05:05.550> carried<00:05:06.060> from<00:05:06.180> that

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
that momentum that he carried from that

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.600 
that momentum that he carried from that
last<00:05:06.659> turn<00:05:06.930> really<00:05:07.289> helped<00:05:07.590> them<00:05:07.740> into<00:05:08.460> that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
last turn really helped them into that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.580 
last turn really helped them into that
final<00:05:09.000> 50<00:05:09.389> part<00:05:09.659> of<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.900> curse<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.380> being

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
final 50 part of the curse of being

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.490 
final 50 part of the curse of being
great<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.880> when<00:05:12.330> there's<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.599> rare<00:05:12.990> thing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
great is that when there's a rare thing

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.589 
great is that when there's a rare thing
like<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.919> even<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.370> could<00:05:14.580> see<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.360> turn

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
like that even I could see that the turn

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.529 
like that even I could see that the turn
the<00:05:15.810> 150<00:05:16.349> turn<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.789> don't<00:05:17.970> ever<00:05:18.090> see<00:05:18.180> that

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
the 150 turn but you don't ever see that

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.210 
the 150 turn but you don't ever see that
it's<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.080> good<00:05:19.260> thing<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.710> happened<00:05:20.070> here

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
it's a good thing that it happened here

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
about the fact that you're heading out

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.050 
about the fact that you're heading out
the<00:05:49.590> altitude<00:05:50.190> is<00:05:50.370> that's<00:05:50.520> something<00:05:50.880> that's

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the altitude is that's something that's

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.430 
the altitude is that's something that's
good<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:51.300> know<00:05:51.419> it's<00:05:51.659> tough<00:05:51.930> because<00:05:52.139> there's

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
good I know it's tough because there's

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.439 
good I know it's tough because there's
not<00:05:52.590> not<00:05:53.159> a<00:05:53.220> lot<00:05:53.310> of<00:05:53.460> things<00:05:53.759> to<00:05:53.909> do<00:05:54.060> out<00:05:54.270> there

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449

but but I think it won't really help
your<00:05:56.430> mindset<00:05:56.759> won't<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.229> it's<00:05:58.229> hard<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.590> say
