00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.920
 and hello how about youtube and good friends 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.810
 Well welcome here to this new guide 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.369
 of achievements and good for this achievement we're going 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.740
 to have to disconnect from what is 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.599
 xbox live and well this is going to be so that 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.009
 to modify the time since this 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.110
 you have to do it at midnight 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.809
 exactly here let's change the time 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.390
 I gave her a blowjob and I changed her camille 20 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.100
 minutes I think and honestly not the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.510
 need since I was champion of a 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.520
 good time and I said do not put me going 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.070
 reach the time but put him 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.450
 about 7 or 8 minutes to spare because if not 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.340
 they will have to wait too long 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.780
 as this can be done legally 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.640
 obviously if you want but have 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.469
 that is exactly what the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.570
 midnight and good corresponds in 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.300
 make a jump in what is the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.609
 second mission of the campaign a jump 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.069
 the guard see you get 11 for 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.539
 change there and well let's choose the 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.699
 first the first but the second 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.839
 mission and I'm going to pass them then now 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.520
 that as in speed 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.659
 quick so you can see where the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.159
 I keep that I do not think that they have 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.190
 sincerely lost since it is very easy 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.560
 to find and good as I tell you this 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.820
 I did it offline, so the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.890
 achievement has no date if you want 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.030
 wait to be legal in one night 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.799
 well then 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.450
 no pecs just this is the 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.280
 way you can say that simple without 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.280
 have to wait for legal hours 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.020
 and good here we have the guard as they 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.090
 I say I'm waiting a long time because 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 if I shit it at the time of using so 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.590
 calculate the time I expected almost 15 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 minutes I was 15 minutes away in 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.720
 that part and well here we can see that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 It's already the time, it's already 11 with 59 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 to make the change to what are the 12 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.810
 and good at that moment simply 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.970
 you have to run with the guard and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.350
 make your jump does not matter that the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.090
 jump is not perfect no matter what 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.289
 you fall well or you fall ill simply 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.210
 is that you make the jump in this 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.159
 platform here once you perform 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.080
 because the jump will go on because the 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.600
 no, well, I hope you have 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.950
