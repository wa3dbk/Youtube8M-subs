00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
back from the original item and we'll do

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.150 
back from the original item and we'll do
a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:55.800> testing<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.390> Minecraft

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
a little testing this is in Minecraft

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
a little testing this is in Minecraft
13w<00:00:59.160> 07<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.449> latest<00:01:00.750> snapshot<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
13w 07 a the latest snapshot and it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.030 
13w 07 a the latest snapshot and it's
been<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> past<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.910> snapshots<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
been in the past two snapshots so

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.020 
been in the past two snapshots so
basically<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> thought<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
basically I thought it was going to be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.469 
basically I thought it was going to be
fixed<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.650> well<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.860> wasn't<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.490> anyways<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
fixed and well it wasn't so anyways this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.109 
fixed and well it wasn't so anyways this
is<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.840> works<00:01:10.340> you've<00:01:11.340> got<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> item

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
is how it works you've got the item

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.620 
is how it works you've got the item
popper<00:01:12.390> below<00:01:13.040> all<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.939> basically

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
popper below all of these are basically

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
popper below all of these are basically
stacked<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> easy<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
stacked and I think a easy way for

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.890 
stacked and I think a easy way for
mojang<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> fix<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> would<00:01:20.570> probably<00:01:21.570> be

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
mojang to fix this would probably be

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
mojang to fix this would probably be
when<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> stack<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> bunch<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.220> cards<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.520> top

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
when you stack a bunch of cards on top

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.770 
when you stack a bunch of cards on top
of<00:01:23.820> each<00:01:23.909> other<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
of each other have some kind of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260 
of each other have some kind of
collision<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:26.640> they'll<00:01:26.759> get<00:01:26.939> spread

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
collision to where they'll get spread

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
collision to where they'll get spread
out<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.229> natural<00:01:28.380> collision

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
out have some kind of natural collision

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
out have some kind of natural collision
that<00:01:29.130> happens<00:01:29.490> whenever<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:30.000> placed<00:01:30.750> one

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that happens whenever they're placed one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
that happens whenever they're placed one
on<00:01:30.990> top<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.259> another<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:32.909> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on top of another and this is just for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
on top of another and this is just for
storage<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> show<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> where<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
storage to show you where all this is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.670 
storage to show you where all this is
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:35.210> but<00:01:36.210> let's<00:01:36.540> throw<00:01:37.049> something<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
going to go but let's throw something in

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.539 
going to go but let's throw something in
oh<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.040> gotta<00:01:38.490> love<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.759> bunch<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> hoes<00:01:40.549> let's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
oh you gotta love a bunch of hoes let's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
oh you gotta love a bunch of hoes let's
see<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> could<00:01:42.659> either<00:01:42.689> take<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.049> long

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
see here so it could either take a long

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
see here so it could either take a long
time<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:47.430> very

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
time or it could be like that it's very

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
time or it could be like that it's very
random<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.970> very<00:01:50.970> Chiddy<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.930> very<00:01:52.170> cheesy

random and very Chiddy very very cheesy
this<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.549> done<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.850> any<00:01:53.880> item<00:01:54.240> any<00:01:54.600> item
