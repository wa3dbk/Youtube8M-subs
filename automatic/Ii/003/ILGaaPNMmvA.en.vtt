00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.630
 Did not you wonder what you got? 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 I wanted to be when I grow up that you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.059
 I used to say it was funny because I always 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.300
 wanted to be a singer and sing along 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.660
 home I was a child thinking that when 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.010
 grow up singer there this super famous 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 follow this career, who knows ? 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 I always liked communication but also 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 to increase kitchen thing that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 pan conversation but I never thought of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 to be a boss who works in a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.219
 expensive restaurant a week policy 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.219
 never had a clue 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.150
 the hour 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.160
 after we grow up people 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 realizes that you can do many things 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.240
 same time then, if you follow a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.250
 profession that is the production that will 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.600
 give money that will give you experience 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.790
 at the same time you can do other 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.310
 thousands of things that do not just give you 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.250
 pleasure and people are happier 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.360
 when I have other projects and the law of 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.300
 I do not work 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.790
 we have nice neighborhoods at the same time 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 once I interviewed a girl she got 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.030
 told me so everyone says that the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.310
 life is too short is not that life 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.710
 It passes quickly but I think life is 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.860
 It's too long for us to do one thing. 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.750
 It's true, life is very good, but 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.340
 Whether or not we look at the day with 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.610
 so much of things that we can 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.430
 to do and we only do one thing 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 nor when we are children we even 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.440
 more sociable we interact more 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.560
 easy with people do not have so many 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.140
 prejudices we do not have the moves in 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.149
 judge people from the beginning and when 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.299
 we write we totally changes 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.860
 this option but not even in childhood 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.210
 I carry many friends 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.159
 Which I think most changes when you 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 become an adult because when you are 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.960
 and makes that lot of friends in the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.270
 school and I saw that lot of experiences 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 for the first time we think that everything 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 It will last forever, people think 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.820
 all those friends will be free of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 several friends as soon as we spoke 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.140
 'we are not the director forever and 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.970
 then when you have our children 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 couples changing city had to continue 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.250
 meeting and imagining, right now I do not 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 none of them I find so 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.810
 few friends stayed in my city 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 It has a recipe or maybe france 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.290
 guys so in love but I grew up 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.870
 Amanda and I like it even today than in August 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.480
 Remember my grandmother remember this thing from 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.780
 boxer played games that my 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.790
 voice spoke cinnamon played for the goal 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.110
 liked defeated in the changes and some 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.570
 of scandals in favorite sweets 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.640
 so mother made it very funny, I 'm just going 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.500
 make my mother made me remember that 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 people ate late as well when they were 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.870
 without a small tooth and attended the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.340
 in the afternoon session and in which 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.290
 Nice, I think it's a little secret. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.780
 that we are going to show here today is 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.480
 to make a chile with a sour cream 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 cool is cool too when you can 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.430
 leave the table some side dishes 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.520
 promotion has passed here and is one with 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.320
 grated who come all week will do 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.940
 a question that came to government 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.940
 against chile 12 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.210
 I think it's a good tip for us. 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.390
 train him the little prince now is 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.940
 so fast and have another look at the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.880
 who has big people not fans 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.160
 they understand nothing by themselves and it is very 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 tiring for the children to stay 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.740
 explaining time we only know well 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.230
 the things that captivated men do not have 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.170
 more time to know anything 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.540
 they buy everything already ready in the stores but 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.330
 as there are no friends' shops 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.770
 men do not have friends if you want a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.770
 captive friend 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.569
 O 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.010

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.250
