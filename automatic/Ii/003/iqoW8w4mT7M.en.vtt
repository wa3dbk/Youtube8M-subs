as the leg begins to drop down we see

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.789

how their begins they continue their
balance<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.489> then<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.819> begins<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.330> rhythm

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
balance but then there begins a rhythm

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080 
balance but then there begins a rhythm
and<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.080> sequence<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.890> when<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.580> legs<00:02:24.819> drop

that's<00:02:37.840> okay<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.379> some<00:02:38.590> respects<00:02:39.040> but

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
that's okay in some respects but

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.009 
that's okay in some respects but
ultimately<00:02:39.909> we<00:02:40.120> want<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.420> try<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.599> keep<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
ultimately we want to try to keep the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.649 
ultimately we want to try to keep the
hands<00:02:41.440> together<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:43.120> long<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.480> possible

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
hands together for as long as possible

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.319 
hands together for as long as possible
until<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.349> get<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> about<00:02:44.890> waist<00:02:45.220> height<00:02:45.489> then

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
until we get to about waist height then

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.819 
until we get to about waist height then
we<00:02:46.569> begin<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.959> separate<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.150> come<00:02:49.390> out

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
we begin to separate and as we come out

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.530 
we begin to separate and as we come out
take<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.890> look<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.280> notice<00:02:51.640> how<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.209> front

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
take a look and notice how the front

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.960 
take a look and notice how the front
foot<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.410> glove<00:02:53.650> hand<00:02:53.950> extend<00:02:54.459> out<00:02:54.640> at

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
foot and that glove hand extend out at

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.390 
foot and that glove hand extend out at
the<00:02:55.239> same<00:02:55.420> time<00:02:55.750> there's<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.590> nice<00:02:56.739> rhythm<00:02:57.069> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the same time there's a nice rhythm and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.759 
the same time there's a nice rhythm and
a<00:02:57.579> good<00:02:57.760> balance<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:59.109> all<00:02:59.290> these<00:02:59.500> pictures

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
a good balance that all these pictures

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.740 
a good balance that all these pictures
are<00:02:59.950> getting<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.030> as<00:03:01.180> they<00:03:01.390> come<00:03:01.629> out

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
are getting so as they come out

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.899 
are getting so as they come out
everything's<00:03:02.409> moving<00:03:02.909> sequentially

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
everything's moving sequentially

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.210 
everything's moving sequentially
rhythmically<00:03:04.659> in<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.620> synchronized<00:03:06.040> movement

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
rhythmically in a synchronized movement

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.559 
rhythmically in a synchronized movement
next<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:09.819> we<00:03:09.909> call<00:03:10.060> our<00:03:10.209> hip<00:03:10.359> and

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
next we get to what we call our hip and

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.839 
next we get to what we call our hip and
shoulder<00:03:10.720> separation<00:03:11.109> we<00:03:12.069> see<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.519> right

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
shoulder separation we see here right

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.490 
shoulder separation we see here right
before<00:03:13.000> foot<00:03:13.450> strike<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.900> see<00:03:14.079> those<00:03:14.230> hips

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
before foot strike we see those hips

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500 
before foot strike we see those hips
starting<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.129> open<00:03:15.280> up<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.790> those<00:03:16.060> shoulders

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
starting to open up and those shoulders

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.470 
starting to open up and those shoulders
stay<00:03:16.720> close<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.609> important<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.450> that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
stay close this is important so that

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.449 
stay close this is important so that
players<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:19.989> develop<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.919> most<00:03:21.130> amount<00:03:21.340> of

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
players can develop the most amount of

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.280 
players can develop the most amount of
torque<00:03:21.819> they<00:03:22.419> can<00:03:22.569> develop<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.989> most<00:03:23.169> amount

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
torque they can develop the most amount

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.620 
torque they can develop the most amount
of<00:03:23.410> power<00:03:23.709> throughout<00:03:24.579> their<00:03:24.849> bodies<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.599> that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
of power throughout their bodies so that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.360 
of power throughout their bodies so that
their<00:03:25.930> belt<00:03:26.139> buckle<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.650> starting<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.130> face

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
their belt buckle is starting to face

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.729 
their belt buckle is starting to face
home<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:27.970> their<00:03:28.419> shoulders<00:03:28.840> are<00:03:29.049> closed<00:03:29.440> off

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
home and their shoulders are closed off

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.080 
home and their shoulders are closed off
as<00:03:29.980> their<00:03:30.730> front<00:03:31.030> foot<00:03:31.269> hits<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.599> ground<00:03:33.090> once

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
as their front foot hits the ground once

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.240 
as their front foot hits the ground once
their<00:03:34.299> front<00:03:34.540> foot<00:03:34.750> hits<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:35.829> into<00:03:36.069> what's

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
their front foot hits we get into what's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.199 
their front foot hits we get into what's
called<00:03:36.340> an<00:03:36.639> equal<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.150> opposite<00:03:37.540> position

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
called an equal and opposite position

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.400 
called an equal and opposite position
the<00:03:40.209> equal<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.629> opposite<00:03:40.930> position

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
the equal and opposite position

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.530 
the equal and opposite position
basically<00:03:41.980> means<00:03:42.699> that<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.060> want<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:43.510> our

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
basically means that we want to have our

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.949 
basically means that we want to have our
elbows<00:03:44.109> up<00:03:44.349> shoulder-height<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:46.419> angle<00:03:46.840> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
elbows up shoulder-height the angle and

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.189 
elbows up shoulder-height the angle and
our<00:03:47.079> elbows<00:03:47.500> should<00:03:47.949> be<00:03:48.129> symmetrical<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.989> take

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
our elbows should be symmetrical we take

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.439 
our elbows should be symmetrical we take
a<00:03:50.230> look<00:03:50.500> at<00:03:50.709> Adam<00:03:51.099> and<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.280> top<00:03:51.519> left<00:03:51.849> right<00:03:52.299> as

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
a look at Adam and the top left right as

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.240 
a look at Adam and the top left right as
his<00:03:52.629> front<00:03:52.870> foot<00:03:53.019> hits<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.349> ground<00:03:53.440> and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
his front foot hits the ground and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.520 
his front foot hits the ground and
although<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:54.819> don't<00:03:55.120> have<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.290> best

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
although we don't have the the best

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.710 
although we don't have the the best
angle<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:57.400> between<00:03:57.669> him<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.209> Roger<00:03:58.389> Clemens
