really most skin like finish what
you<00:02:13.709> do<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.130> obviously<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.700> buff<00:02:14.940> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you do is this obviously you buff it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.759 
you do is this obviously you buff it
into<00:02:15.300> your<00:02:15.480> skin<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.019> normally<00:02:16.170> would<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
into your skin as you normally would and

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.100 
into your skin as you normally would and
you<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:18.090> sure<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.269> use<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.780> light

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
you just make sure you use a very light

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.560 
you just make sure you use a very light
hand<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.739> obviously<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.880> adding<00:02:21.180> product

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
hand and obviously it's adding product

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.050 
hand and obviously it's adding product
but<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.380> putting<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.310> much<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.940> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
but it's not putting so much on so it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:36.720 
but it's not putting so much on so it
looks<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.420> fresh

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.040 

again<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.180> using<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.600> concealer

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.200 
again I'm going to be using a concealer
to<00:02:39.230> conceal<00:02:39.500> areas<00:02:40.190> such<00:02:40.370> as<00:02:40.400> under<00:02:40.850> my<00:02:41.000> eyes

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
to conceal areas such as under my eyes

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.930 
to conceal areas such as under my eyes
I'm<00:02:41.870> not<00:02:42.080> really<00:02:42.200> going<00:02:42.410> for<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.710> only

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
I'm not really going for that only

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.670 
I'm not really going for that only
highlighted<00:02:43.940> look<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.110> want<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.560> is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
highlighted look so what I want to do is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680 
highlighted look so what I want to do is
use<00:02:45.830> my<00:02:45.860> ring<00:02:46.220> finger<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.880> pretty<00:02:47.090> much<00:02:47.270> blend

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
use my ring finger to pretty much blend

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.350 
use my ring finger to pretty much blend
in<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.290> concealer<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.130> looks<00:02:49.280> seamless<00:02:49.550> it

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
in the concealer so it looks seamless it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.020 
in the concealer so it looks seamless it
camouflages<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.380> covers<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.860> areas<00:02:52.280> however

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
camouflages and covers the areas however

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.240 
camouflages and covers the areas however

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
it doesn't really look over the top and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:12.910 
it doesn't really look over the top and
over<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:56.210> cakey<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:56.960> too<00:02:57.890> obvious<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.860> I'm
