00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
doll was given to a family that was

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.590 
doll was given to a family that was
asked<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> kill<00:02:57.640> their<00:02:57.790> child<00:02:58.060> if<00:02:58.239> their<00:02:58.390> town

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
asked to kill their child if their town

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600 
asked to kill their child if their town
was<00:02:58.780> too<00:02:58.989> poor<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.320> example<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.370> wouldn't

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
was too poor for example they wouldn't

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.880 
was too poor for example they wouldn't
have<00:03:00.700> enough<00:03:00.940> food<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.330> they<00:03:01.450> wouldn't<00:03:01.720> have

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
have enough food or they wouldn't have

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.520 
have enough food or they wouldn't have
enough<00:03:02.890> crops<00:03:03.489> harvested<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.959> year<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
enough crops harvested for the year to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.100 
enough crops harvested for the year to
support<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.459> new<00:03:06.640> life<00:03:06.910> in<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.690> small<00:03:08.080> village

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
support a new life in the small village

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.260 
support a new life in the small village
I<00:03:08.560> should<00:03:08.770> say<00:03:08.920> Hamlet<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:10.090> they<00:03:10.209> were

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
I should say Hamlet really they were

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.500 
I should say Hamlet really they were
smaller<00:03:10.660> even<00:03:10.930> than<00:03:11.050> villages<00:03:11.620> at<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.920> point

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
smaller even than villages at that point

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.970 
smaller even than villages at that point
usually<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.810> could<00:03:14.020> be<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.170> due<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.770> bad

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
usually this could be just due to a bad

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.900 
usually this could be just due to a bad
harvest<00:03:15.280> but<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.670> also<00:03:15.820> could<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.930> greedy

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
harvest but it also could be to a greedy

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.630 
harvest but it also could be to a greedy
samurai<00:03:18.910> ruler<00:03:19.300> or<00:03:20.140> Shogun<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> ruler

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
samurai ruler or Shogun a ruler

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.290 
samurai ruler or Shogun a ruler
but<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.530> most<00:03:23.680> part<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.280> was<00:03:24.730> something

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
but for the most part it was something

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.510 
but for the most part it was something
that<00:03:25.330> was<00:03:25.600> practice<00:03:26.230> they<00:03:26.530> were<00:03:26.590> given<00:03:27.010> this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
that was practice they were given this

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.610 
that was practice they were given this
kokeshi<00:03:28.060> doll<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.780> kokeshi<00:03:29.200> doll<00:03:29.440> was

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
kokeshi doll in that kokeshi doll was

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.470 
kokeshi doll in that kokeshi doll was
then<00:03:29.830> placed<00:03:30.069> in<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.490> area<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.209> child

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
then placed in the area that the child

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.930 
then placed in the area that the child
was<00:03:31.720> sleep<00:03:32.110> as<00:03:32.740> a<00:03:32.800> reminder<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.610> life

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
was sleep as a reminder of that life

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.590 
was sleep as a reminder of that life
that<00:03:34.150> they<00:03:34.270> had<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.480> take<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:36.700> me<00:03:36.880> I<00:03:36.940> feel<00:03:37.390> like
