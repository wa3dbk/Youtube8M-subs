unserious I'm sure given the networks
will<00:02:43.490> be<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:43.760> user<00:02:43.940> centric<00:02:44.270> than<00:02:44.510> just

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
will be more user centric than just

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.330 
will be more user centric than just
having<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.140> as<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> broadcast<00:02:45.650> medium<00:02:45.920> place

having it as a broadcast medium place

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.310 
having it as a broadcast medium place
and<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.150> device<00:02:47.390> should<00:02:47.420> know<00:02:47.690> more<00:02:47.870> about<00:02:48.020> me

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
and the device should know more about me

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.870 
and the device should know more about me
than<00:02:48.500> me<00:02:48.830> getting<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.250> know<00:02:49.370> know<00:02:49.550> more<00:02:49.760> about

beatles for people it's not enough for
us<00:04:08.870> anymore<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:10.040> design<00:04:10.400> things<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:11.090> are

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
us anymore to design things that are

us anymore to design things that are
local<00:04:11.780> around<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.620> mobile<00:04:13.070> one<00:04:13.850> purse<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.480> so

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
local around the mobile one purse and so

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.199 
local around the mobile one purse and so
on<00:04:14.780> because<00:04:15.590> this<00:04:15.830> is<00:04:16.010> sending<00:04:16.340> data<00:04:16.549> up<00:04:16.850> here

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
on because this is sending data up here

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.789 
on because this is sending data up here
which<00:04:17.480> means<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.110> see<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.470> look<00:04:18.680> at

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
which means that we can see it look at

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.800 
which means that we can see it look at
patterns<00:04:19.070> from<00:04:19.700> many<00:04:19.910> people<00:04:20.360> and<00:04:20.570> use<00:04:20.780> that

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
patterns from many people and use that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.740 
patterns from many people and use that
to<00:04:21.080> feed<00:04:21.410> back<00:04:21.620> into<00:04:21.920> our<00:04:22.670> applications<00:04:23.540> and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
to feed back into our applications and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.040 
to feed back into our applications and
change<00:04:24.020> them<00:04:24.290> so<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.650> have<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:26.050> cloud

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
change them so you have this cloud

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680 
change them so you have this cloud
lining<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.340> connecting<00:04:29.210> us<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.390> gain

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
lining that is connecting us to gain

lining that is connecting us to gain
collect<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.290> then<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.830> also

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
collect and then you can also

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.900 
collect and then you can also
crowdsource<00:04:32.450> again<00:04:33.050> back<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.320> these<00:04:33.620> users<00:04:34.070> by

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
crowdsource again back to these users by

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.960 
crowdsource again back to these users by
having<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.870> collaborative<00:04:36.350> platform<00:04:36.970> and

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
having a collaborative platform and

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.470 
having a collaborative platform and
achieving<00:04:38.480> whatever<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.960> would<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.830> think

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
achieving whatever you would so I think

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.960 
achieving whatever you would so I think
Mobile<00:04:41.480> will<00:04:41.990> pay<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.290> huge<00:04:42.890> role<00:04:43.130> in<00:04:43.160> the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
Mobile will pay a huge role in the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.720 
Mobile will pay a huge role in the
emerging<00:04:44.300> markets<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.870> future<00:04:45.580> we<00:04:46.580> also

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
emerging markets in the future we also

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.140 
emerging markets in the future we also
realize<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:48.560> walk<00:04:49.460> here<00:04:49.730> looking<00:04:49.970> into

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
realize I walk here looking into

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.610 
realize I walk here looking into
presence<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.810> we're<00:04:51.080> looking<00:04:51.350> at<00:04:51.440> what's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
presence and we're looking at what's

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.470 
presence and we're looking at what's
going<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.950> down<00:04:53.110> well<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.440> guess<00:04:55.100> we<00:04:56.000> let<00:04:56.180> start

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
going on down well I guess we let start

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.250 
going on down well I guess we let start
to<00:04:56.630> do<00:04:58.240> we<00:04:59.240> don't<00:04:59.420> have<00:04:59.510> something<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.020> carry

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
to do we don't have something to carry

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.500 
to do we don't have something to carry
anymore<00:05:00.590> maybe<00:05:01.190> we<00:05:01.460> get<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.790> speak<00:05:02.060> course

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
anymore maybe we get to speak course

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.470 
anymore maybe we get to speak course
also<00:05:02.920> use<00:05:03.920> anything<00:05:04.220> rather<00:05:04.580> if<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.270> place

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
also use anything rather if the place

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.920 
also use anything rather if the place
it's<00:05:06.020> like<00:05:06.410> about<00:05:06.800> having<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.550> everywhere<00:05:08.420> or

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
it's like about having it everywhere or

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.260 
it's like about having it everywhere or
everyone<00:05:09.380> is<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.920> true<00:05:10.130> mobile<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.670> Ben<00:05:10.940> yet

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
everyone is a true mobile is Ben yet

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.830 
everyone is a true mobile is Ben yet
already<00:05:11.620> look<00:05:12.620> for<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.980> to<00:05:13.130> find<00:05:13.370> out<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.600> as

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
already look for it to find out it is as

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.740 
already look for it to find out it is as
so<00:05:15.200> purvis<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:16.400> ubiquitous<00:05:16.910> that<00:05:17.210> you

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
so purvis and so ubiquitous that you

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.030 
so purvis and so ubiquitous that you
would<00:05:17.870> not<00:05:17.960> be<00:05:18.140> able<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.320> differentiate<00:05:18.680> with

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
would not be able to differentiate with

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.830 
would not be able to differentiate with
yourself<00:05:19.700> or<00:05:19.820> your<00:05:19.940> things<00:05:20.150> around<00:05:20.360> movie

so<00:05:23.050> there's<00:05:23.260> your<00:05:23.320> answer<00:05:23.440> there<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:23.890> think<00:05:24.130> the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
so there's your answer there I think the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.300 
so there's your answer there I think the
future<00:05:24.490> belongs<00:05:24.640> in<00:05:25.030> jail

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310
