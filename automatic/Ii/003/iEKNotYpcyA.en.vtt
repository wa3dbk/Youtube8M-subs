other<00:04:23.150> any<00:04:24.150> other<00:04:24.270> manga<00:04:24.630> frankly<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.620> think

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
other any other manga frankly so I think

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.890 
other any other manga frankly so I think
they<00:04:26.039> went<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.220> little<00:04:26.430> bit<00:04:26.580> over

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
they went a little bit over

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.189 
they went a little bit over
ward<00:04:27.110> with<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:28.000> in<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.240> but<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:29.780> could

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
ward with that in this but that could

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.159 
ward with that in this but that could
just<00:04:30.229> be<00:04:30.380> me<00:04:31.120> overall<00:04:32.120> I'm<00:04:32.300> surprised<00:04:32.810> at<00:04:33.050> how

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
just be me overall I'm surprised at how

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.930 
just be me overall I'm surprised at how
much<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.770> characters<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.669> speed

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
much I like the characters and the speed

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.120 
much I like the characters and the speed
of<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.150> story<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.449> was<00:04:35.660> afraid<00:04:36.350> this<00:04:36.800> would<00:04:36.949> be

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
of the story I was afraid this would be

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.770 
of the story I was afraid this would be
at<00:04:37.370> one<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.669> these<00:04:37.729> shoujo<00:04:38.090> stories<00:04:38.509> that's

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
at one of these shoujo stories that's

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.560 
at one of these shoujo stories that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
just very relationship heavy you know

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.330 
just very relationship heavy you know
there's<00:04:41.960> cloud<00:04:42.169> card<00:04:42.440> stuff<00:04:42.680> but<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:42.889> would<00:04:43.220> be

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
there's cloud card stuff but it would be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.850 
there's cloud card stuff but it would be
kind<00:04:43.639> of<00:04:43.669> light<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.210> instead<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.199> drives

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
kind of light and instead this drives
