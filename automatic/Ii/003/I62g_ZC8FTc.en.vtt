00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.750
 Hello everyone and good comment 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.060
 the other day I was teaching the clues 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.430
 these that supposedly left us here 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.560
 those of trier for what were the modes 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.869
 funk vivales good well apart from these 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.779
 clues that had here were these 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.810
 papers down here seem simple 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.190
 papers that they put there to fill by 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.410
 all maps like many of us 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.570
 we think good because they are not simple 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.160
 papers and I 'm going to teach it now 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.400
 they are in the rest of maps of 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 multiplayer are not in zombies 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.460
 only in multiplayer and now I'm going 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.550
 to teach a few of the maps 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.610
 where are the papers for example here 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.510
 in drone here are these papers so much 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.120
 here as here and they are exactly 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.489
 same papers now if we're going to 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.489
 After mail are also the same 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.870
 papers are here are here in this 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.180
 site 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.190
 they are around here they are all over the map 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 but I'm teaching several sites 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.659
 where they are on each map is worth 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.400
 you want to say this good let's continue 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.560
 seeing more sites 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 now we are going to charge here order are 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 here 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 being here on this site too 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 they are on the map , I'm telling you, but 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 I teach several sites are there and now 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.569
 I love losing another map now we are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.409
 here in downhill is worth and here they are here 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:37.709
 on the ground I am on this site here 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.219
 now we are going to square and in square they are 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.219
 here inside 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.820
 there is a joke what does this mean 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.190
 maps are almost all people in almost 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 all maps only multiplayer 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.950
 I say I do not want to stress that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 Well now we do come here to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.200
 ship 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.690
 this and another completely different thing 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.890
 ok we come here to the boat at 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.060
 stateroom this main and down here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.100
 you are seeing a few books not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 well these books could be books 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.340
 anyone then look what Edward says 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.910
 ristov in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.670
 edward ristov in 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.520
 because they have put this book here with the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.130
 of books that they can put but what 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.990
 coincidences but if it is the same book 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.760
 what exactly is here in newtown 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.110
 well let's go back to the beginning and 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.990
 let's continue with those of the tracks 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.630
 then we are here we see the papers 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.150
 no good I told you before I could 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.090
 be any good paper well if 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.710
 we look closely at the photo and we look 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.480
 well with the look we get close and I 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.800
 at the beginning I was saying this a manchurrÃ³n 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.370
 this good he thought a thousand things is worth 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.960
 that could be down to the base of the moon 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.780
 of zombies well it turns out that if 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.730
 look well those are heads that are 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.650
 looking down as if you 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.700
 you were lying down and you see the sky between 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.280
 head and head look and as a ray of light 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.980
 between body and body on the one hand 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.950
 are zombies and I is what I think the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.590
 in my opinion they are zombies and as it says and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.260
 in the post and well said the zombies 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.800
 they are arriving because they put these the ones of 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.830
 trier and nothing but those in multiplayer 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.100
 Well, I think they're putting it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:38.810
 because within six months I do not know if 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.930
 in the last d lc or in another next call 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.910
 of duty but if you see that they are going to put 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.780
 but because so much trouble in putting 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.840
 so many tracks everywhere 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.450
 in my opinion it is worth but what is 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.910
 Of course it is written and that we 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.910
 they have put here for us to see them 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.690
 zombies are coming prepare you up 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.690
 the next video
