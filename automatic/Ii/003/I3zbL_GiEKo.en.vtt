00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to the outside of the beef so work can

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.929 
to the outside of the beef so work can
adding<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.350> grain<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> meat

little bit of unsalted butter into the
pan<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:45.630> keep<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> pan<00:02:46.290> moving<00:02:46.860> let

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
pan like so just keep the pan moving let

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.479 
pan like so just keep the pan moving let
the<00:02:47.880> mushrooms<00:02:48.060> cook<00:02:48.959> evenly<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:50.040> each<00:02:50.220> side

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the mushrooms cook evenly on each side

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.690 
the mushrooms cook evenly on each side
if<00:02:51.330> use<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> set<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.110> tongs<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.800> turn<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
if use a set of tongs just to turn the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
if use a set of tongs just to turn the
mushrooms<00:02:54.090> over<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:55.170> cook<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.709> I'm

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
mushrooms over as they cook and I'm

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.350 
mushrooms over as they cook and I'm
increasing<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.489> temperature<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> pan

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
increasing the temperature of the pan

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.750 
increasing the temperature of the pan
though<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:58.080> keep<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.650> dry<00:02:58.860> obviously<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.580> add

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
though to keep it dry obviously if I add

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640 
though to keep it dry obviously if I add
the<00:02:59.940> mushrooms<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.930> they're<00:03:01.110> gonna<00:03:01.230> start<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the mushrooms and they're gonna start to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
the mushrooms and they're gonna start to
release<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.950> little<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.459> liquid<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.030> need<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
release a little bit of liquid I need to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.360 
release a little bit of liquid I need to
increase<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.080> temperature<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.980> everything

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
increase the temperature so everything

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.130 
increase the temperature so everything
in<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.519> pan<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.910> frying<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.870> doesn't

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
in the pan is frying and it doesn't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.039 
in the pan is frying and it doesn't
starts<00:03:07.500> doing

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
and as the mushrooms caramelized move

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.330 
and as the mushrooms caramelized move
them<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.269> one<00:03:12.420> side<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.930> pan<00:03:13.230> below<00:03:13.799> the

spikes that cross the pan it leaves a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.159 
spikes that cross the pan it leaves a
clear<00:05:12.039> trail<00:05:12.550> from<00:05:13.330> one<00:05:13.570> side<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.080> other

that tells me I've just got to the right

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.680 
that tells me I've just got to the right
consistency<00:05:18.100> for<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.030> sauce<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.390> at<00:05:19.479> that

consistency for the sauce and at that

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.159 
consistency for the sauce and at that
point<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.080> turn<00:05:20.350> off<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.680> gas<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:22.300> let

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
point I turn off the gas and just let

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.750 
point I turn off the gas and just let
the<00:05:23.289> pan<00:05:23.530> cool<00:05:23.950> down<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> bit<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.610> can<00:05:24.669> see

red none of that heavy scent that's come

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.990 
red none of that heavy scent that's come
from<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:32.020> whiskey<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:32.770> it's<00:05:32.979> it's<00:05:33.910> this

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
from the whiskey and it's it's this

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.330
