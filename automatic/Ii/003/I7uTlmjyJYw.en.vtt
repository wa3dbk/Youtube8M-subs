gear<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> thing<00:00:52.890> called<00:00:53.190> white<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
gear you get this thing called white and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
gear you get this thing called white and
this<00:00:53.850> light<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.390> points<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> each<00:00:55.620> point

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this light has points and each point

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
this light has points and each point
actually<00:00:56.250> builds<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
actually builds up and you can get a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
actually builds up and you can get a
higher<00:00:58.020> rank<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.219> i'm<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.370> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
higher rank from this now i'm going to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
higher rank from this now i'm going to
show<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.579> guys<00:00:59.730> i<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> rig<00:01:00.270> 39<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.020> i

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
show you guys i have a rig 39 there i

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
show you guys i have a rig 39 there i
have<00:01:01.170> 39<00:01:01.770> points<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.789> rank<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.539> i

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have 39 points to my next rank and if i

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.299 
have 39 points to my next rank and if i
switch<00:01:03.870> these<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:04.650> drops<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
switch these back it actually drops to a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
switch these back it actually drops to a
38<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.869> having<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> each<00:01:07.650> gear<00:01:08.130> will

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
38 so with having that each gear will

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
38 so with having that each gear will
actually<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> piece<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> light<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
having more light allows you to rank up

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.270 
having more light allows you to rank up
higher<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.540> level<00:01:12.689> 20<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.710> guys<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.220> to

higher than level 20 now guys the way to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
higher than level 20 now guys the way to
get<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> higher<00:01:14.880> gear<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.810> just

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
at rank 20 and at that point guys you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.780 
at rank 20 and at that point guys you
actually<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.769> go<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> light<00:02:42.519> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
actually do have to go for the light to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.759 
actually do have to go for the light to
be<00:02:43.060> able<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.269> go<00:02:43.360> even<00:02:43.569> any<00:02:43.840> higher<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
be able to go even any higher and the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.650 
be able to go even any higher and the
reason<00:02:45.190> for<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.610> having<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.000> higher<00:02:46.209> rank<00:02:46.569> than

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
reason for you having a higher rank than

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.750 
reason for you having a higher rank than
20<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.310> actually<00:02:48.459> have

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
20 is because you have to actually have

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.190 
20 is because you have to actually have
a<00:02:48.790> higher<00:02:48.880> rank<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.600> able<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> participate

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
a higher rank to be able to participate

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.259
