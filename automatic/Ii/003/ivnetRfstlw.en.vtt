00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
glitches if I would come and get them he

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
glitches if I would come and get them he
would<00:00:25.410> let<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:26.029> but<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.570> wanted

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
me to come and I I thought it was

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
me to come and I I thought it was
interesting<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.750> had<00:00:30.869> two<00:00:31.019> strong

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

must say I thought everybody did a very
professional<00:01:27.180> job<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.689> reaching<00:01:27.900> the

whole nine yards then when I went I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.789 
whole nine yards then when I went I
found<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.820> utterly<00:01:33.079> fascinating<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.610> have

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
found it utterly fascinating now I have

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
found it utterly fascinating now I have
not<00:01:37.799> talked<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.280> great<00:01:38.400> deal<00:01:38.520> about<00:01:39.049> what<00:01:40.049> was

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

I found him alert in better health than

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.710 
I found him alert in better health than
most<00:01:47.280> people<00:01:47.610> thought<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.119> clearly<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
most people thought and clearly in

most people thought and clearly in
command<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> situation<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.000> clearly

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
command of the situation and clearly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.520 
command of the situation and clearly
interested<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.659> whether<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.320> some

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
interested in whether there was some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
interested in whether there was some
positive<00:01:52.829> outcomes<00:01:53.670> more<00:01:54.000> positive<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
positive outcomes more positive than the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.149 
positive outcomes more positive than the
ones<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.290> generated<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:55.979> their

ones that are generated by their
policies<00:01:56.700> today<00:01:57.439> but<00:01:58.820> beyond<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
policies today but beyond that I think I

policies today but beyond that I think I
shouldn't<00:02:00.899> say<00:02:01.110> anything<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.219> don't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
shouldn't say anything because I don't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.200 
shouldn't say anything because I don't
have<00:02:03.149> any<00:02:04.579> policymaking<00:02:05.579> authority<00:02:06.060> anymore

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
have any policymaking authority anymore

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.219 
have any policymaking authority anymore
and<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.689> want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> inadvertently

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and I don't want to inadvertently

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
and I don't want to inadvertently
constrain<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.670> president's<00:02:09.209> options<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.780> do

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
constrain the president's options I do

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.300 
constrain the president's options I do
think<00:02:10.289> he's<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> good<00:02:10.800> job<00:02:10.979> by<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.190> way

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
think he's not a good job by the way

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.699 
think he's not a good job by the way
