if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> somehow<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.600> near<00:01:51.840> people<00:01:52.049> because

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
if you somehow are near people because

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.810 
if you somehow are near people because
they're<00:01:52.649> bad<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.280> front<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> boss

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
they're bad and in front of the boss

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.160 
they're bad and in front of the boss
instead<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.210> behind<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.659> where<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.079> do

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
instead of behind it where they can do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
instead of behind it where they can do
more<00:01:55.290> damage<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:56.399> aware<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.180> start

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
more damage be aware if you start

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
more damage be aware if you start
getting<00:01:57.540> stacks<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> scorched<00:01:58.740> debuff

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
getting stacks of the scorched debuff

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130 
getting stacks of the scorched debuff
because<00:02:00.210> that'll<00:02:00.479> increase<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> damage<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because that'll increase the damage that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
because that'll increase the damage that
you<00:02:01.409> take<00:02:02.119> all<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> stay<00:02:04.020> away

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you take all you have to do is stay away

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749 
you take all you have to do is stay away
from<00:02:04.200> people<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.009> shouldn't<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.460> an

this<00:02:46.950> move<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.280> super<00:02:47.700> annoying<00:02:47.820> because

this move is super annoying because

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.660 
this move is super annoying because

receive less healing and the circle is
ginormous<00:02:55.850> what's<00:02:56.850> worse<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.600> hard

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
ginormous what's worse is that it's hard

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
just stick it out and try to get out of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.670 
just stick it out and try to get out of

the circle and wait until he comes back
down<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.370> good<00:03:12.330> idea<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> put<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.050> marker<00:03:13.350> down

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
down a good idea is to put a marker down

down a good idea is to put a marker down

left or his right he can only put two up
at<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> time<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.870> find<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.350> spot<00:04:19.710> that

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
at a time so you just find a spot that

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.620 
at a time so you just find a spot that
isn't<00:04:20.220> shielded<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.000> whale<00:04:21.150> away<00:04:21.299> on<00:04:21.510> him

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
isn't shielded and you whale away on him

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.810 
isn't shielded and you whale away on him
for<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> few<00:04:21.960> seconds<00:04:22.550> additionally<00:04:23.550> he'll<00:04:23.700> be

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
for a few seconds additionally he'll be

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.850 
for a few seconds additionally he'll be
using<00:04:24.000> some<00:04:24.570> red<00:04:24.930> white<00:04:25.110> frost<00:04:25.410> damage<00:04:25.590> every

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
using some red white frost damage every

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.300 
using some red white frost damage every
once<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.130> a

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
once in a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.980 
once in a
but<00:04:26.580> it's<00:04:26.730> pretty<00:04:27.000> unpredictable<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.900> you

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
but it's pretty unpredictable so you

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
but it's pretty unpredictable so you
really<00:04:28.169> shouldn't<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.710> worry<00:04:28.830> about

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
really shouldn't have to worry about

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.500 
really shouldn't have to worry about
that<00:04:30.139> face<00:04:31.139> for<00:04:31.220> Kwan<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.580> all<00:04:32.970> out<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.180> Quillen

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
that face for Kwan is all out of Quillen

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.230 
that face for Kwan is all out of Quillen
so<00:04:34.169> he<00:04:34.530> will<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:34.889> start<00:04:35.070> punching<00:04:35.340> himself

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
so he will just start punching himself

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.970 
so he will just start punching himself
well<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.200> guess<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.500> won't<00:04:37.650> be<00:04:37.680> punching

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
well I guess you won't be punching

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.860 
well I guess you won't be punching
himself<00:04:38.130> he'd<00:04:38.460> be<00:04:38.550> punching<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:39.690> he'll

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
himself he'd be punching you but he'll

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870 
himself he'd be punching you but he'll
be<00:04:39.900> punching<00:04:40.290> never<00:04:40.710> mind<00:04:40.950> there's<00:04:41.730> really

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
be punching never mind there's really

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.580 
be punching never mind there's really
not<00:04:42.090> much<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> note<00:04:42.660> here<00:04:42.870> except<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.500> he

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
not much to note here except that he

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.470 
not much to note here except that he
will<00:04:43.710> continuously<00:04:44.220> buff<00:04:44.639> himself<00:04:45.030> for<00:04:45.270> more

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
will continuously buff himself for more

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.379 
will continuously buff himself for more
damage<00:04:45.840> every<00:04:46.260> 10<00:04:46.500> seconds<00:04:46.919> or<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:47.210> he'll<00:04:48.210> also

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
damage every 10 seconds or so he'll also

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.900
