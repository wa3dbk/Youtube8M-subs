00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
is sure not what I know is you know it's
very<00:01:54.960> easy<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> point<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> finger<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> say

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
very easy to point the finger and say

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
very easy to point the finger and say
during<00:01:56.310> worshipping<00:01:56.939> Hindu<00:01:57.270> gods<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
during worshipping Hindu gods and so

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800 
during worshipping Hindu gods and so
this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.740> happening<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> them<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.719> know

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this is happening to them but you know

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.670 
this is happening to them but you know
we<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.229> learn<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:04.020> different<00:02:04.409> ways

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we all learn we all in different ways

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
we all learn we all in different ways
and<00:02:04.860> different<00:02:04.920> respect<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.700> sins<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.570> our

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and different respect have sins in our

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.719 
and different respect have sins in our
lives<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.140> need<00:02:07.409> fixing<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.160> guide<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
lives that we need fixing from guide and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
lives that we need fixing from guide and
so<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.840> better<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.319> us<00:02:10.379> during

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so I think it's better for us during

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.400 
so I think it's better for us during
these<00:02:10.860> times<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:12.450> know
