00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.820 
knight this is a black and colored
version<00:00:21.600> because<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> prototype

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
version because it is the prototype

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.189 
version because it is the prototype
statue<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.670> making<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.630> batman

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
arkham knight Robin action figure I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
arkham knight Robin action figure I
think<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.599> extra<00:00:27.900> figure<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> also

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
think it's the extra figure it also

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
think it's the extra figure it also
could<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> statue<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> doesn't

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
could just be a statue but that doesn't

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780 
could just be a statue but that doesn't
matter<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.570> Robin<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.529> confirmed<00:00:32.399> being

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
matter because Robin is confirmed being

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670
