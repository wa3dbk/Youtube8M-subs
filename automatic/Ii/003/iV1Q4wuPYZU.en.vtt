00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.250
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.309
 abc rural 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.370
 we always talk about the quality of 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.580
 milk and a lot of it depends on the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.340
 animal health hygiene the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.230
 conservation and the work that is done in 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.830
 the industry but now let's talk 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.869
 of the sanitary management of dairy cattle 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 the doctor they sawed now what the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.820
 dairy cattle health and 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.269
 importance that this has on the quality 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.269
 of milk 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.860
 today we are in the establishment of the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 faculty of veterinary sciences 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 in the productive unit that denominates 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 we are in this case the division won 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.700
 bovine milk which we will try 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.360
 an issue that is really important for 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.580
 all group of dairy cattle that is the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
 health aspect from that point of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 sight we can say that there are some 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.550
 pillars in production that focus 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.710
 in all productive scope as it comes to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.460
 be the nutrition the genetics the handling and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.320
 the health many producers even now 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 they include it to the final commercialization 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.450
 of the product the health of the cows in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.899
 gestation is of fundamental importance 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 to achieve calves and calves 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.869
 healthy 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.479
 we can face and say that the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.300
 product let's say of the birth that comes to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 be the baby must be born with certain 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.259
 characteristics especially from the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.880
 point of view of managing to have 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.159
 health to have certain certain 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.310
 handles 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.810
 childbirth is read for example 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.329
 and assist if possible through a 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.159
 schedule that is called let's say 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.530
 the probable date of birth of the cows 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.640
 to give birth and it's the side we have 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.400
 what 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 Be careful, for example, to place 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.790
 cows the parturient dry places in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.060
 high places in places where we can 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.020
 we have on hand we can 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.450
 let's say to see it constantly and already in the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.420
 time of delivery makes an assistance 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.240
 part of the producer and part 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 of the tambero the professional highlighted the 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220
 importance of having a calendar 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.650
 health and how and with what 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.680
 periodicity should be used 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.909
 vaccines all diseases 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.530
 that we can prevent with the application 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:55.189
 of certain vaccines we have to try to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.379
 schedule and we have to try to 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:01.980
 get let's say a management plan 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.049
 simple that the producer especially 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.090
 the small and medium producer can 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.430
 carry it out on their farms 30 days 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.980
 before delivery you can apply this 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.250
 vaccine against pneumonitis in such a way 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.139
 that the baby that is being born 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.569
 cartilage antibodies already produced 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.579
 passively colostrum wallet 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.829
 another vaccination strategy against 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.799
 pneumonia tease since the calves are born 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.709
 calves can already apply the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.560
 first dose between 3 days old 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.219
 repeats after 21 days I work one in 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.840
 chronological order that can be applied 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:41.090
 it's against the anthrax vaccine 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.620
 symptomatic this symptomatic carbuncle 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.459
 commonly known in the jargon 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.879
 peasant as the spot p is one of the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.160
 vaccines that we say should not agree 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.099
 missing from our campus or must 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.709
 be well done and should be 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.900
 let's say also fulfilled with the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.310
 application is applied within both 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.690
 months of age 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.880
 repeats at 21 days can every year and 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.040
 This vaccine can be applied to 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.560
 animals under 2 years old ie 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.190
 recommends applying to years in order 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.500
 chronological and another vaccine depending on 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.740
 the characteristics in ours 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.690
 there are vaccines for example 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.000
 are to prevent certain types of 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.340
 abortion diseases this vaccine is 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.600
 applies between three to eight months of 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.050
 age the strain of 19 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.590
 It is very important to make a record in 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.220
 the sernac sab 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.700
 let's say the entity that really 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.420
 regulate and let's say you register it 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.200
 this vaccine 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.590
 it is very important to keep in mind that it is 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.660
 let's say better in revives therefore 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.560
 its application must be quite 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.750
 meticulous 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.200
 we can also say that the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.080
 animals that are vaccinated maybe the 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.250
 females against this vaccine is recorded and 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.500
 they even load low on brand in the 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.440
 left cheek with a short bird of 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.830
 vaccine or the next vaccine is a 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 vaccine that is down in campaign is 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.850
 regulated and vaccine 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.710
 Cough fibers to vaccine against fever 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:37.940
 aphthous both the chain and the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.950
 let's say all the regulations are 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.320
 given by the sernac finally the doctor 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.530
 rolÃ³n pointed out what the vaccines are 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.460
 reproductive and importance there 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.639
 other vaccines already from the point of view 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.860
 reproductive 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.969
 can be applied for example in 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.849
 times very close to the service we are 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.610
 speaking for at least a month or two months 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.189
 before the service and that vaccine are the 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.199
 that I find reproductive vaccines 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:13.370
 what are the reproductive vaccines 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.319
 we have the bovine viral diarrhea dvd 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.180
 we have oliver also another kate 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.750
 infectious 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.630
 we have for example elected heartburn and 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.100
 some campylobacteriosis that also 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.419
 let's say other diseases can 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.750
 produce reproductive problems 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.450
 Then foresee the 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.290
 this prevention is done both in 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.620
 heifers in cows and even in bulls 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:42.530
 However, the vaccine against brucellosis 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.310
 for example only are vaccinated at 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.310
 females 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.280
 i
