00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 So people, we know it's the engine. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 the piston was due to this explanation 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.860
 to you is the following the motor 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 difference with the piston engine to the engine of the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.269
 boe says she was the piston engine is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 The one I told you about is the engine. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 the question of using an iron engine 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.350
 combustion it requires 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 a propeller to generate the attraction already this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.929
 is the piston engine a turbocharged engine is to be 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.130
 basically the same thing except that besides 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.730
 your engine is the question that will turn s 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.059
 is a turbocharged design engine that will generate 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.539
 This is mine but the basics is that the engine 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.480
 piston it uses a motor to use 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.940
 piston bring air is if the engine turbo jet 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.219
 to use the piston engine and uses a motor 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.280
 jet that will turn itself anyway 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 are the airways but the engine and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 turboprop airplane it also has a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 attraction generated by the turbo already a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.909
 but it's a big part of the attraction of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 a turbo propeller engine comes to is this not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.549
 of the engine but is is a fee 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.070
 approximately 80% of the attraction of a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.280
 turbo engine and either by propeller and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.040
 another 20% is by jet but it is basically 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 that's the difference of the turboprop profession 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.470
 and this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 The piston uses a piston 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 turn the propeller and 100% of the attraction is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.409
 generated by the propeller has some 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 only more whole attraction generated by s 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.009
 the turbo-propeller engine is what turns the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 propeller is an option that has already been 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 is in itself a turboprop is a jet year and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.100
 remembering that the turboprop also 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 It has a rate the engine in getting rid of rs 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 also generates attraction around 20% of the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 attraction of the turbo propeller engine came from 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.969
 engine and the other 80% come from the propeller 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.729
 beauty was talking about a driver here 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.380
 cool this motor issue is important 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.899
 take the necessary characteristics 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.489
 for a good engine is the nautical 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.640
 what are the necessary characteristics 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.250
 for a good point for the radio and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 necessary factors are that safety 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.319
 durability little vibration economy 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.870
 ease of maintenance with opacity 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.849
 thermal efficiency and lightness these are the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
 main factors that we only have one 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.989
 engine or nautical will be good but it is 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.610
 asking that the lightness and the last thing 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.489
 that everything that was said and everything was missing 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.819
 I understand that this is the light motor 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.340
 medium - more or less or less 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.260
 being sure that I will say what it is 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 lightness to people is a very 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.540
 important that we have to know so much 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.550
 for our life in aviation as well as for 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.640
 its probable in the defense council is 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.989
 very important people are lightness and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.629
 mass power how to improve it let's 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.019
 is the following people all motor 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.319
 it will take what a certain mass engine 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.959
 it will have to be top are O edson 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.170
 both the turboprop both the issue 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.879
 motor they already have a certain mass 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.970
 that motorcycle is beautiful to have 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.550
 a mass can be that it generates 90 of the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 type 7 button as our beloved 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.220
 there and eat that the pec is equip our 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.170
 fleet of the neighbors in the pubis there are two 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.250
 motors marking my continental 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.500
 they have a dough is nothing then the dough 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.780
 This mass has what the whole mass has 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.909
 weight depending on the severity you have 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.810
 weight, but it is this weight that mass is 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.180
 important that in the nautical engine she 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.400
 as small as possible until the engine 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560
 very heavy that will make a motor 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720
 too heavy will it be necessary to 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.860
 attraction to get you out of 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.209
 the ground and if you increase his performance 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.130
 was a measurement and be aware of what the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.290
 pi fuel consumption does not need 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.849
 more energy to get off the ground right 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.450
 so there is not a really cool engine with 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.099
 admiration 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.640
 So it's all good the relationship has to 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.769
 have a minimum lightness rate, ie the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.260
 power mass ratio has to be the 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.570
 least possible that mean gt 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.709
 it means that what the engine it has 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 of being has to have a mass 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.729
 and have a great power. 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.430
 that we mean that kakÃ¡ for the 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.710
 power developed in that engine in 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.630
 God relationship has to be very small 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.950
 the lower this higher ratio 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.110
 let's give an example here for you 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.300
 To understand, people, let's see an example. 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.290
 here for us to understand that this cool 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:49.570
 we have two engines one engine one engine 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:55.860
 2 2 engine our first engine 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:59.410
 it has a mass of 120 pounds 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:05.380
 her 120 pounds our engine 2 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:09.900
 it has a mass of 720 that I was 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:14.050
 mass in the mass 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:21.370
 underneath 10 power the engine 1 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:23.440
 and develops 150 hp power to power 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.730
 him to ride on horsepower what on horseback 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:33.790
 of forces at 150 horses has an engine 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:36.910
 engine 2 also 150 hp is sure people 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.980
 knows that lightness is what the relationship of 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.140
 mass by powers am 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.900
 this is the concept of lightness and how much 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.090
 the lower the better lightness of the engine knows 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.730
 aeronautical engines had the slightest 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.440
 is it possible to ask which of the 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.510
 two is the best nautical engine 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.160
 He replied that it is a sector why not 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.080
 make this relationship here the relationship of 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.020
 this motor 1 and 2 is as follows in 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.340
 Engine 1 is the relationship of duty to know what 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.380
 It's 0 08 Mega Thinks A Relationship 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.750
 very light ie the lightness of it is 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.240
 low that it is a good thing we sought 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.669
 8 that expects to have a mass is a relation 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.310
 very low lightness sure is a 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.900
 Good thing you have to have a very 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.030
 down means a good thing if a 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.630
 class that the ideal for the nautical because 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.980
 motor 2 with the defense relationship nor 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:38.430
 calculate that calculates that goes from the 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:43.740
 wearing clothes on the 2nd floor 4 4 v8 that 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:48.090
 the hp to say what you mean our 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.720
 time it is this little bit of lightness of 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.700
 sewer 2 is very high on page 8 hp is 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.400
 them to have a defense relationship with 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.740
 high it means that this tone does not have 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.080
 a low lightness vision of it is high logo 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.870
 This engine here is not cool. 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.910
 the evaluation is that the post your proof of 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.140
 marks the best neurological motor 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:14.540
 lightness and lightness is the relationship 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.540
 mass power motor company 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.800
 was transformed into mechanical energy 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.520
 because it is connected here in our 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.770
 scheme reveals that it will happen 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.830
 sorry for our home 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.090
 after I get off and it's called a business 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.090
 that I forgot
