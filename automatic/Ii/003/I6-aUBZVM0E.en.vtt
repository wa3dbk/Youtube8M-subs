00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello everyone i am review 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.110
 new photography welcome to a new 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 video tutorial of the magic section to a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 couple of clicks here I'm with this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.510
 photography has been working with this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.980
 photograph which I have already edited and is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.390
 a photograph of a town called 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 san andrés de teixidó who is in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 galicia to which I recommend that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.310
 go if you have the opportunity because 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.650
 it's really beautiful it 's a wonder 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.260
 and well after editing I have given 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.780
 mind that I would have liked more to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.130
 the composition of the photo that is 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 window that is here was a 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.720
 little bit more to the right 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 like at the time of taking the photo what 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.430
 I did like that if I had changed a little bit 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.860
 the position in which I was as such 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.140
 I would have changed it but it's like that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.960
 so what I'm going to do is help 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.490
 of a tool that appeared new in 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.739
 photoshop cs 6 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.110
 now we are in photoshop etc. you see it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.540
 here and it's a tool that appeared 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.640
 new and it works really well 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.620
 let's do in this case of course 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.800
 magic with a couple of clicks because it's that 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.380
 you will see how fabulous it is and what 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.360
 powerful that is this tool we are going to 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.490
 it since I roll up a lot and go 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.509
 to start doubling the layer you know 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.400
 that to duplicate the layer we can press 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:32.190
 command jo control j on our keyboard 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.820
 there it is and here you have the layer already 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.330
 duplicated also if you want you can 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 do it by clicking on the layer 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.580
 you carry this icon that is to create 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.860
 a new layer and you already create a copy of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.170
 the layer now I'm going to my bar 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 tools and selected the tool 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.260
 I'm going to make a selection of the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.100
 window and part of what is around 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.030
 well not too tight 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.030
 and I like that above 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.899
 you do not have to select the window 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.929
 total perfectly all the contour of 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.090
 the window and now this is when we go to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.040
 use this new tool that is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.740
 below you already know that sometimes in the bar 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.410
 of tools 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.740
 most of the time when we leave 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.100
 our cursor on the tool 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.840
 appears this panel appears a panel with 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.340
 other tools underneath it 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 now let's use this which is the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.050
 movement tool with detection 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.360
 content 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.130
 let's click on our window and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.650
 We are going to move it wherever we want 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.489
 I wish we had been 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.260
 I'm going to leave it here for example here 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.879
 I could change the most possible but I 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.989
 I think that here we are not going to force 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.299
 too much things and I'll leave it for 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.550
 here we will see now how it works 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.940
 photoshop 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.300
 and in a few moments of truth it takes 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.210
 bit 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.540
 is going to make the change for me here what 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.420
 we have here you have it pulse eat in my 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.630
 keyboard to select and you have 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.030
 seen how it has been formidably 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.920
 has filled with 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.000
 what he has found around me re 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.580
 fill that gap 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.070
 now yes if we look we're going to look 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.740
 a little bit if we look at this case 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.710
 he has repeated the pattern a little 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.730
 look here you have it repeated a 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.730
 little there is forgiveness 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.950
 has repeated a little bit what is the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.200
 brick pattern you see it repeats 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.450
 here a little bit but let's try 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.290
 fix it with with a couple of 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.320
 more tools are we going to use the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.500
 clone buffer tool and the 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.110
 tool to a jiffy and the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.180
 corrective brush tool and 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.810
 let's see how we can correct 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.190
 a little bit 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.050
 for example I will use 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.410
 the punctual concealer brush to remove 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.120
 a little bit here and for example I'm going to 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.120
 clone this part 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.900
 little bit more, as you see, I think that 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.269
 much better there is here a 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.600
 We're going to take a little bit 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.510
 sample from another site 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.000
 I'm cloning with other parts that I'm going 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.290
 finding 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.290
 and now I use the brush with 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.150
 You have seen how I could imitate 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.490
 with these tools a little bit what 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.950
 is the texture of the wall and how it has 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.400
 changed the situation of the window 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.620
 Look, the little eye of this cape 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.500
 window returns where it was 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.680
 and now a little more inside and although 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.260
 be something that seems insignificant in 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.750
 reality changes the composition of the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.699
 photography and in my opinion the improvement 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.970
 pretty much nothing would only be left 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.350
 put my watermark and you're done 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.199
 I hope you liked this 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.330
 remember tool beneath 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.040
 movement with detection forgiveness under 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.870
 of corrective brush tool 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.060
 is the movement tool with 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.850
 content detection 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.710
 and it works great prove it with other 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.570
 things with other elements that you want 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.860
 move inside a photograph and already 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.370
 you will see how well it goes 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.210
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.720
 Thank you for your attention 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.850
 and I wait for you in the next video tutorial 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.050
 or in the blog that knows the clouds 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.050
 photograph a hug
