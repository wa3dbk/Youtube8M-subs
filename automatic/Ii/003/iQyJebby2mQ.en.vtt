this<00:00:17.740> vintage<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.220> 2010<00:00:20.180> vintage<00:00:20.420> has<00:00:21.290> been

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
this vintage the 2010 vintage has been

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.140 
this vintage the 2010 vintage has been
the<00:00:21.650> coolest<00:00:21.860> vintage<00:00:22.520> on<00:00:22.820> record<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:24.880> for<00:00:25.880> us

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
the coolest vintage on record and for us

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.760 
the coolest vintage on record and for us
that<00:00:26.960> means<00:00:27.260> that<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.460> fruit<00:00:29.240> is<00:00:29.770> developing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
that means that the fruit is developing

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.990 
that means that the fruit is developing
slowly<00:00:31.220> that<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.650> maturity<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
slowly that the maturity of the the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.290 
slowly that the maturity of the the
grapes<00:00:35.270> is<00:00:35.600> happening<00:00:36.110> very<00:00:36.140> slowly<00:00:36.500> which

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
grapes is happening very slowly which

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.229 
grapes is happening very slowly which
will<00:00:38.500> ultimately<00:00:39.500> allow<00:00:39.769> a<00:00:40.370> very<00:00:40.670> complex

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
will ultimately allow a very complex

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.630 
will ultimately allow a very complex
wine<00:00:42.170> at<00:00:43.059> ideally<00:00:44.059> lower<00:00:44.269> alcohol<00:00:44.890> or<00:00:45.890> slower

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
wine at ideally lower alcohol or slower

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.440 
wine at ideally lower alcohol or slower
sugar<00:00:47.239> accumulation<00:00:48.280> at<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.489> time<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:50.090> decide

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
sugar accumulation at the time we decide

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:59.520 
sugar accumulation at the time we decide
to<00:00:50.600> pick

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.270 

what<00:01:00.160> we're<00:01:00.399> doing<00:01:00.879> on<00:01:01.120> our<00:01:01.960> first<00:01:02.860> fruit

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
what we're doing on our first fruit

what we're doing on our first fruit
thinning<00:01:03.610> pass<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.210> we're<00:01:04.510> looking<00:01:04.900> for<00:01:05.790> great

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
thinning pass is we're looking for great

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.539 
thinning pass is we're looking for great
levels<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.540> variation<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.590> what<00:01:09.220> we're<00:01:09.369> going

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
levels of variation and what we're going

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.350 
levels of variation and what we're going
to<00:01:09.790> do<00:01:09.970> is<00:01:10.210> remove<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.400> fruit<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.820> most

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
to do is remove the fruit that is most

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
to do is remove the fruit that is most
behind

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
behind

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240

we're<00:01:15.400> not<00:01:15.580> needing<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.259> thin<00:01:17.259> fruit<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
we're not needing to thin fruit to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.149 
we're not needing to thin fruit to
lighten<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.090> crop<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.720> have<00:01:19.990> slightly<00:01:20.800> below

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
lighten the crop we have slightly below

lighten the crop we have slightly below
average<00:01:21.520> crop<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.810> year<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.920> have<00:01:24.159> a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.710 
slightly above average canopy size
because<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.430> all<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.820> rains<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.509> had

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
because of all the rains that we had

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.980 
because of all the rains that we had
this<00:01:28.990> spring<00:01:30.180> leaving<00:01:31.180> us<00:01:31.360> with<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.600> tremendous

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
this spring leaving us with a tremendous

this spring leaving us with a tremendous
amount<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.560> water<00:01:32.860> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.850> ground<00:01:34.119> to

amount of water in the ground to

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.680 
amount of water in the ground to
vigorously<00:01:35.470> grow<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.039> vines<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.759> we've

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
vigorously grow the vines and we've

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.930 
vigorously grow the vines and we've
gotten<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.170> vines<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.590> transition<00:01:39.340> their

gotten the vines to transition their
energy<00:01:40.509> into<00:01:41.110> ripening<00:01:41.590> fruit<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.159> can<00:01:42.310> see

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
energy into ripening fruit you can see

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.090 
energy into ripening fruit you can see
the<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.270> Browning<00:01:43.869> off<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.440> Canes<00:01:44.740> the

the the Browning off of the Canes the
wood<00:01:45.340> enos<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.970> Canes<00:01:46.240> that's<00:01:46.720> called

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
wood enos of the Canes that's called

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.859 
wood enos of the Canes that's called
lignin<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.789> Canes<00:01:49.030> we've<00:01:49.300> achieved<00:01:49.450> that

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
lignin of the Canes we've achieved that

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.430 
lignin of the Canes we've achieved that
and<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.830> achieved<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.580> at<00:01:51.960> version<00:01:52.960> which<00:01:53.229> is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
and we achieved that at version which is

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.130 
and we achieved that at version which is
always<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> goal<00:01:54.580> for<00:01:54.909> me<00:01:55.030> if<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.300> can<00:01:55.360> get<00:01:55.690> lignin

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
always a goal for me if I can get lignin

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.430 
always a goal for me if I can get lignin
of<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> wood<00:01:57.100> at<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.850> same<00:01:58.090> time<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:59.080> fruit

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
of the wood at the same time the fruit

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.859 
of the wood at the same time the fruit
is<00:01:59.710> going<00:02:00.399> through<00:02:00.610> verision<00:02:00.909> then<00:02:01.690> I've

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
is going through verision then I've

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.350 
is going through verision then I've
achieved<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.770> particular<00:02:03.640> balance<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
achieved a particular balance in the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.499 
achieved a particular balance in the
vine<00:02:04.590> I've<00:02:05.590> got<00:02:05.860> two<00:02:06.159> clusters<00:02:06.700> three

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
vine I've got two clusters three

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.819 
vine I've got two clusters three
clusters<00:02:07.990> on<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.410> chute<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:11.230> this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
clusters on this chute I have on this

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.210 
clusters on this chute I have on this
cluster<00:02:12.340> down<00:02:12.549> here<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> wing<00:02:14.220> this

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
cluster down here I have a wing this

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880 
cluster down here I have a wing this
little<00:02:15.730> piece<00:02:16.239> here<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.620> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
little piece here and this is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920 
little piece here and this is
significantly<00:02:18.640> behind<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.480> rest<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
significantly behind the rest of the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.979 
significantly behind the rest of the
cluster<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.620> I'm<00:02:20.799> going<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.280> remove<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.600> wing

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
cluster so I'm going to remove this wing

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.560 
cluster so I'm going to remove this wing
from<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.160> cluster<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.970> leaving<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.420> main

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
from that cluster just leaving the main

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.430 
from that cluster just leaving the main
body<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.079> cluster<00:02:26.590> then<00:02:27.400> I'm<00:02:27.549> going<00:02:27.910> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
body of the cluster then I'm going to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.990 
body of the cluster then I'm going to
evaluate<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.709> three<00:02:30.040> clusters<00:02:30.519> on<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> chute

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
evaluate the three clusters on the chute

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030 
evaluate the three clusters on the chute
I<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.390> want<00:02:31.600> any<00:02:31.810> more<00:02:32.049> than<00:02:32.109> two<00:02:32.500> clusters

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
I don't want any more than two clusters

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.670 
I don't want any more than two clusters
this<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> really<00:02:34.269> painful<00:02:34.540> decision<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
this is a really painful decision to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.099 
this is a really painful decision to
make<00:02:35.890> because<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:37.180> kind<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.660> look<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:37.930> these

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
make because you kind of look at these

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.710 
make because you kind of look at these
clusters<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:39.040> into<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.570> beautiful<00:02:40.570> bottle

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
clusters going into a beautiful bottle

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.360 
clusters going into a beautiful bottle
of<00:02:40.930> wine<00:02:41.109> but<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.769> wines<00:02:41.980> are<00:02:42.130> not<00:02:42.160> going

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
of wine but it the wines are not going

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.039 
of wine but it the wines are not going
to<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:42.640> beautiful<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.299> don't<00:02:43.480> remove<00:02:43.780> one

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
to be as beautiful if I don't remove one

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.360 
to be as beautiful if I don't remove one
so<00:02:44.549> what<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:46.180> here<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:47.799> cluster<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
so what I see here is this cluster is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.099 
so what I see here is this cluster is
slightly<00:02:48.760> behind<00:02:49.060> there's<00:02:49.510> more<00:02:49.780> green

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
slightly behind there's more green

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.430 
slightly behind there's more green
berries<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:51.070> total<00:02:51.519> on<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.269> cluster<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.290> I'm

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
berries in total on the cluster so I'm

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.750 
berries in total on the cluster so I'm
going<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.799> remove<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.430> that's<00:02:54.549> pretty

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
going to remove and that's pretty

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.140 
going to remove and that's pretty
typical<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.690> upper<00:02:56.049> cluster<00:02:56.500> being

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
typical of the upper cluster being

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.370 
typical of the upper cluster being
developmentally<00:02:58.150> behind<00:03:00.959> beautiful<00:03:01.959> cluster

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
developmentally behind beautiful cluster

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.030 
developmentally behind beautiful cluster
of<00:03:02.500> grapes<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:03.480> don't

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
of grapes I don't

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.940 
of grapes I don't
crime<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.930> cluster<00:03:07.439> here<00:03:07.739> is

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
crime but this cluster here is

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.759 
crime but this cluster here is
completely<00:03:08.579> green<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:10.230> rest<00:03:10.469> of<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
completely green and the rest of the

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.119 
completely green and the rest of the
plant<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.430> rest<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.879> clusters<00:03:12.329> on<00:03:13.129> on

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
plant the rest of the clusters on on

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.160 
plant the rest of the clusters on on
this<00:03:14.700> chute<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.390> mention<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> third

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
this chute not to mention it's a third

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.649 
this chute not to mention it's a third
cluster<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.609> chute<00:03:17.909> so<00:03:18.209> we'll<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.540> ahead

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
cluster on that chute so we'll go ahead

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.720 
cluster on that chute so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:18.840> remove<00:03:19.049> this<00:03:19.469> cluster<00:03:19.950> completely<00:03:20.489> and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and remove this cluster completely and

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.759 
and remove this cluster completely and
then<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.689> wing<00:03:21.989> down<00:03:22.230> here<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.310> is

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
then I see a wing down here that is

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.610 
then I see a wing down here that is
completely<00:03:25.769> green<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.810> comparison<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
completely green in comparison to the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.610 
completely green in comparison to the
rest<00:03:28.859> of<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.220> body<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.670> cluster<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.810> we

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
rest of the body of the cluster so we

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.949 
rest of the body of the cluster so we
notice<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.489> an<00:03:32.670> annual<00:03:33.180> basis<00:03:33.659> that<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
notice that on an annual basis that the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.190 
notice that on an annual basis that the
wings<00:03:34.170> are<00:03:34.469> behind<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.849> in<00:03:36.180> general<00:03:36.930> we're

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
wings are behind so in general we're

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.720 
wings are behind so in general we're
removing<00:03:38.060> 100%<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:40.260> wings<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.609> can

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
removing 100% of the wings and you can

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.210 
removing 100% of the wings and you can
see<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.239> an<00:03:42.389> extremely<00:03:43.220> detail-oriented

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
see this is an extremely detail-oriented

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.349 
see this is an extremely detail-oriented
process

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
process

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.240 
process
I'm<00:03:46.049> not<00:03:47.510> excessively<00:03:48.510> removing<00:03:49.290> fruit<00:03:49.709> at

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
I'm not excessively removing fruit at

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.729 
I'm not excessively removing fruit at
this<00:03:50.760> point<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.359> see<00:03:51.599> this<00:03:51.780> cluster<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.349> still

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
this point you see this cluster is still

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.089 
this point you see this cluster is still
a<00:03:53.010> little<00:03:53.519> bit<00:03:53.760> green<00:03:54.079> some<00:03:55.079> variation<00:03:55.889> is

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
a little bit green some variation is

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.640 
a little bit green some variation is
okay<00:03:56.549> what<00:03:56.819> we're<00:03:56.970> trying<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.689> is<00:03:57.930> get<00:03:58.470> rid

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
okay what we're trying to do is get rid

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.429 
okay what we're trying to do is get rid
of<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.950> dramatic<00:03:59.159> variation<00:03:59.939> the<00:04:00.510> completely

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
of the dramatic variation the completely

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.710 
of the dramatic variation the completely
green<00:04:01.739> from<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:03.180> mostly<00:04:03.569> colored<00:04:04.019> up<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:05.720> we

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
green from the mostly colored up and we

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.420 
green from the mostly colored up and we
will<00:04:06.870> come<00:04:07.109> back<00:04:07.379> through<00:04:07.709> here<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
will come back through here one of the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.229 
will come back through here one of the
reasons<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.909> we<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.389> this<00:04:09.659> tent<00:04:10.560> netting<00:04:11.519> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
reasons that we do this tent netting so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.180 
reasons that we do this tent netting so
that<00:04:12.389> we<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.690> come<00:04:12.900> back<00:04:13.169> through<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:13.829> three

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that we can come back through here three

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.670 
that we can come back through here three
or<00:04:14.220> four<00:04:14.459> times<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.720> last<00:04:15.870> pass<00:04:16.260> what

or four times in the last pass what

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.990 
or four times in the last pass what
we're<00:04:16.829> doing<00:04:17.099> is<00:04:17.220> we're<00:04:17.370> actually<00:04:17.549> taking

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
we're doing is we're actually taking

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.909 
we're doing is we're actually taking
these<00:04:18.359> little<00:04:18.630> shears<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.289> we're<00:04:19.440> plucking

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
these little shears and we're plucking

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.640 
these little shears and we're plucking
individual<00:04:20.729> green<00:04:21.030> berries<00:04:21.539> out<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.500> are

individual green berries out that are

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.110 
individual green berries out that are
still<00:04:22.889> green<00:04:23.190> where<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> rest<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
still green where the rest of the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.689 
still green where the rest of the
cluster<00:04:24.360> has<00:04:24.570> developed<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:25.949> that<00:04:26.130> berry<00:04:26.400> for

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
cluster has developed but that berry for

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.610 
cluster has developed but that berry for
some<00:04:26.880> reason<00:04:27.210> isn't<00:04:27.360> maturing<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.080> we'll

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
some reason isn't maturing and we'll

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.860 
some reason isn't maturing and we'll
pluck<00:04:28.949> those<00:04:29.159> berries<00:04:29.610> out<00:04:29.760> one<00:04:30.120> by<00:04:30.300> one<00:04:30.330> so

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
pluck those berries out one by one so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
pluck those berries out one by one so
