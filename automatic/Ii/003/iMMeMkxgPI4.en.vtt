forward<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.610> review<00:04:54.030> probably<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.720> these<00:04:54.870> at

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
forward to a review probably on these at

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.219 
forward to a review probably on these at
least<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:55.979> one<00:04:56.160> anyway<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.820> freefall<00:04:57.229> i

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
least this one anyway the freefall i

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.460 
least this one anyway the freefall i
think<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:58.890> actually<00:04:59.120> completes<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:01.320> I've

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
think this actually completes that I've

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.740 
think this actually completes that I've
actually<00:05:01.970> had<00:05:02.970> every<00:05:03.419> 2013<00:05:04.350> Kershaw<00:05:05.750> this

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
actually had every 2013 Kershaw this

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.779 
actually had every 2013 Kershaw this
year<00:05:06.990> it's<00:05:07.470> kind<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.620> crazy<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:08.130> bought<00:05:08.520> in<00:05:08.640> all

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
year it's kind of crazy I bought in all

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.270 
year it's kind of crazy I bought in all
their<00:05:08.970> models<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:10.530> reviewed<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.890> few<00:05:11.070> quite<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
their models and reviewed a few quite a

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800 
their models and reviewed a few quite a
few<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.580> them<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.360> think<00:05:12.539> these<00:05:12.600> are<00:05:12.660> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
few of them and I think these are the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.080 
few of them and I think these are the
only<00:05:12.870> two<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.080> didn't<00:05:13.380> have<00:05:13.530> yet<00:05:13.770> so<00:05:14.070> I'll<00:05:14.700> do<00:05:15.060> a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
only two I didn't have yet so I'll do a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.420 
only two I didn't have yet so I'll do a

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
review on these as well it's gonna be a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.129 
review on these as well it's gonna be a
little<00:05:17.520> different<00:05:17.610> than<00:05:18.210> your<00:05:18.450> standard<00:05:18.660> free

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139
