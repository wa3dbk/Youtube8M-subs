 like so many 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.130
 transit for bancaja and provokes 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.080
 the taco cruise warner in the next 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.880
 must change eighths

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.280
 facua meadow 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 and paco turn that put the brake 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.970
 zapata expressed

 Brake parts for a convenient and accurate quick installation 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.350
 if you do not change your dad time you run the risk of scratching the disc another by 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929
 the high metal part cut that 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.929
 acpt talk was awarded highlighted wang 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.040
 this guide will precede work 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
 they expected it 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 and remember the open heels you can find on the high seas 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.290
 advice is asked for the facts 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.300
 before changing the brake fluid 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.770
 how have you won what I imagine that moved for many 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.280
 the first thing we have to do is train correctly 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.100
 the brake fluid above to prevent bubbles from forming 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.869
 air that the brake pedal can not fail at the time of 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.159
 it's hard to know things 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.189
 he committed it to our security 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.419
 we have to know that it is very important 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:20.469
 is that also 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.539
 we have to train it correctly to eliminate the contamination 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.249
 leading edge that was formed over time was 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.880
 this proposal in her opposite 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 along the 25 thousand kilometers 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.099
 this accumulate moisture pollution 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.839
 efe so 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.029
 for example submachine gun does not remember if not for the time that the 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:41.980
 brake fluid there 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.309
 said act 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.249
 attentive to proceed 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.669
 it's here 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.529
 clean containers but yes a brand 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.059
 of minimum and maximum 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.339
 took into account when it came to having 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.999
 to change it 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.429
 Thanks to our friends from Guaza Auto we have learned to why we have 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:06.049
 change the brake fluid and when we have to change the closers 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.649
 propose us 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.079
 the cost of keeping them pure made nothing eto'o was tied up
