thing<00:02:45.030> at<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.180> end<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> Joker<00:02:46.320> you're

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
thing at the end with the Joker you're

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.890 
thing at the end with the Joker you're
playing<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> Joker<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.270> insane

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
playing as the Joker that was insane

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.180 
playing as the Joker that was insane
that<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> descent<00:02:50.100> into

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that was just like a descent into

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.710 
that was just like a descent into
madness<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.940> was<00:02:51.030> perfect<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
madness but it was perfect because it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.770 
madness but it was perfect because it
was<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.020> Batman<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.920> well<00:02:53.130> done<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.780> it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
was so Batman and so well done and it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.660 
was so Batman and so well done and it
was<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.320> Batman's<00:02:55.800> conditioning<00:02:56.459> like

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
was it was Batman's conditioning like

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.490 
was it was Batman's conditioning like
him<00:02:56.910> powering<00:02:57.420> through<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.020> defeating

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
him powering through this and defeating

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.410 
him powering through this and defeating
and<00:02:58.709> conquering<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> Joker<00:02:59.610> within<00:03:00.000> him<00:03:00.180> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
and conquering the Joker within him and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
and conquering the Joker within him and
that<00:03:01.020> was<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.350> was<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.650> cool<00:03:01.860> I'm<00:03:02.100> going

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
that was that was so cool I'm going

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.440 
that was that was so cool I'm going
through<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.820> real<00:03:03.000> quick<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.390> I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
through this all real quick because I

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.430 
through this all real quick because I
don't<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> lot<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.959> time<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.230> talk<00:03:04.410> about

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
don't have a lot of time to talk about

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.720 
don't have a lot of time to talk about
it<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.860> wanted<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.190> hear<00:03:05.280> from<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.580> guys<00:03:05.670> in

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
it but I wanted to hear from you guys in

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.790 
it but I wanted to hear from you guys in
the<00:03:05.850> comments<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> ending<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.350> ending<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
the comments but the ending the ending I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.320 
the comments but the ending the ending I
thought<00:03:08.130> was<00:03:08.280> very<00:03:08.310> cool<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.700> wish<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.150> was<00:03:09.300> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
thought was very cool I wish it was a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.210 
thought was very cool I wish it was a
little<00:03:09.420> more<00:03:09.780> ambiguous<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:10.920> thought<00:03:11.070> what

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
little more ambiguous but I thought what

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.350 
little more ambiguous but I thought what
it<00:03:11.310> did<00:03:11.430> was<00:03:11.520> kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> cool<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.239> does

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
it did was kind of cool because it does

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.850 
it did was kind of cool because it does
raise<00:03:12.570> some<00:03:12.600> questions<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.230> ultimately<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.709> do

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
raise some questions and ultimately I do

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.199 
raise some questions and ultimately I do
like<00:03:14.100> an<00:03:14.220> ending<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.640> does<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> now<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
like an ending that does that now the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.699 
like an ending that does that now the
very<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.900> very<00:03:16.110> ending<00:03:16.440> after<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
very this is the very ending after the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.050 
very this is the very ending after the
nightfall<00:03:17.100> protocol<00:03:17.549> I'm<00:03:17.640> talking<00:03:17.910> about

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
nightfall protocol I'm talking about

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.759 
nightfall protocol I'm talking about
what<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> did<00:03:18.450> really<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.110> duality

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
what I did really like is that duality

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.530 
what I did really like is that duality
that<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.459> family<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> child

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that you see that family with a child

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.750 
that you see that family with a child
and<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.440> clearly<00:03:22.830> mirroring<00:03:23.459> Bruce

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
and it's it's clearly mirroring Bruce

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.640 
and it's it's clearly mirroring Bruce
and<00:03:24.030> Thomas<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.450> Martha<00:03:24.570> Wayne<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.440> night

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and Thomas and Martha Wayne the night

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
and Thomas and Martha Wayne the night
they<00:03:25.769> got<00:03:25.890> shot<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.880> love<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.299> there's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
they got shot but I love that there's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
they got shot but I love that there's
the<00:03:27.690> difference<00:03:28.080> between<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.799> now<00:03:29.010> is

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the difference between then and now is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.430 
the difference between then and now is
that<00:03:29.820> now<00:03:30.000> there's<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.299> symbol<00:03:30.780> now<00:03:31.110> there's<00:03:31.380> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
that now there's a symbol now there's a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.199 
that now there's a symbol now there's a
figure<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:32.160> will<00:03:32.280> keep<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> family<00:03:32.940> alive

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
figure that will keep that family alive

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.850 
figure that will keep that family alive
that<00:03:33.420> will<00:03:33.540> give<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.900> kid<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.290> better<00:03:34.530> fate

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
that will give that kid a better fate

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.830 
that will give that kid a better fate
than<00:03:34.890> what<00:03:35.610> Batman<00:03:35.820> had<00:03:36.180> that's<00:03:36.360> what<00:03:36.600> I<00:03:36.630> like

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
than what Batman had that's what I like

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.330 
than what Batman had that's what I like
about<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.130> more

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
about it I like that a little bit more

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180 
about it I like that a little bit more
than<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> literal<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.650> laughs<00:03:40.650> for<00:03:41.070> your

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
than the literal like laughs for your

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.220 
than the literal like laughs for your
bad<00:03:41.400> thing<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.030> was<00:03:42.150> revealed<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.780> think<00:03:43.140> it's

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
bad thing that was revealed I think it's

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.870 
bad thing that was revealed I think it's
very<00:03:43.380> cool<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.980> do<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> idea<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.700> using

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
very cool I do like the idea of using

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.000 
very cool I do like the idea of using
the<00:03:45.120> Scarecrow's<00:03:45.510> fear<00:03:45.540> toxin<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:46.350> good<00:03:46.620> even

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the Scarecrow's fear toxin for good even

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.860 
the Scarecrow's fear toxin for good even
though<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.190> does<00:03:47.370> seem<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.549> little<00:03:47.640> weird<00:03:48.239> for

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
though it does seem a little weird for

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.170 
though it does seem a little weird for
Batman<00:03:49.320> or<00:03:49.530> whoever<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.160> using<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.700> maybe<00:03:50.880> it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
Batman or whoever is using it maybe it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.090 
Batman or whoever is using it maybe it's
Jason<00:03:51.570> Todd<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.049> like<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> think<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.680> Batman

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
Jason Todd I like to think it's Batman

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.069 
Jason Todd I like to think it's Batman
and<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.820> like<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.120> think<00:03:54.299> he's<00:03:54.450> using<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> his

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
and I like to think he's using it to his

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.890 
and I like to think he's using it to his
advantage<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.650> keep<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.310> symbol<00:03:57.239> going<00:03:57.690> that

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
advantage to keep that symbol going that

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.720 
advantage to keep that symbol going that
like<00:03:58.049> yes<00:03:58.350> everybody<00:03:58.829> knows<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.280> Batman<00:03:59.610> is

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
like yes everybody knows the Batman is

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.699 
like yes everybody knows the Batman is
Bruce<00:03:59.880> Wayne<00:04:00.120> now<00:04:00.390> but<00:04:01.019> they're<00:04:01.200> still<00:04:01.230> afraid

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
Bruce Wayne now but they're still afraid

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.289 
Bruce Wayne now but they're still afraid
of<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:01.920> symbol<00:04:02.310> because<00:04:02.549> he's<00:04:02.730> making<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
of that symbol because he's making it a

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.180 
of that symbol because he's making it a
fearful<00:04:03.870> thing<00:04:04.049> again<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> whether<00:04:04.950> it's

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
fearful thing again and whether it's

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.280 
fearful thing again and whether it's
more<00:04:05.430> literal<00:04:05.820> or<00:04:06.030> metaphorical<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.959> wish<00:04:07.140> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
more literal or metaphorical I wish it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.170 
more literal or metaphorical I wish it
was<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> little<00:04:07.680> more<00:04:08.190> metaphorical<00:04:08.910> than<00:04:09.060> how

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
was a little more metaphorical than how

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.550 
was a little more metaphorical than how
they<00:04:09.329> made<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.540> with<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.900> dialogue<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.410> stuff

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
they made it with the dialogue and stuff

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.380 
they made it with the dialogue and stuff
but<00:04:11.070> ultimately<00:04:11.519> that's<00:04:11.790> what<00:04:12.030> Batman<00:04:12.299> is

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
but ultimately that's what Batman is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.520 
but ultimately that's what Batman is
