00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
laid the blocks underneath and this is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.429 
laid the blocks underneath and this is
the<00:00:20.970> smooth<00:00:21.270> finish<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> show<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the smooth finish and I got to show you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.359 
the smooth finish and I got to show you
how<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> did<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
how I did it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.790 
how I did it
you're<00:00:24.029> forming<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> concrete<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.619> we'll

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you're forming the concrete here we'll

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.270 
you're forming the concrete here we'll
put<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:28.279> three-quarter<00:00:29.279> inch<00:00:29.460> board

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
put this three-quarter inch board

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.979 
put this three-quarter inch board
because<00:00:32.410> that's<00:00:33.410> going<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.680> be<00:00:33.770> our<00:00:33.920> lip

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
because that's going to be our lip

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.740 
because that's going to be our lip
usually<00:00:35.989> put<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.260> lip<00:00:36.500> on<00:00:36.739> here<00:00:40.750> because

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
usually put a lip on here because

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.299 
usually put a lip on here because
concrete<00:00:42.050> always<00:00:42.710> picks<00:00:43.010> up<00:00:44.170> contracts<00:00:45.309> so

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
concrete always picks up contracts so

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.119 
concrete always picks up contracts so
this<00:00:47.059> is<00:00:47.180> gonna<00:00:47.330> hide<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.960> crack<00:00:48.379> that's<00:00:48.920> why

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
this is gonna hide that crack that's why

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.640 
this is gonna hide that crack that's why
they<00:00:49.280> always<00:00:49.400> put<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:49.760> lip<00:00:50.000> on<00:00:50.210> concrete<00:00:50.690> get

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
they always put a lip on concrete get

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
they always put a lip on concrete get
the<00:00:51.830> board

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the board

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.190 
the board
and<00:00:53.910> measure<00:00:54.150> down<00:00:54.450> where<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.080> the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
and measure down where we want the

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.490 
and measure down where we want the
concrete<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:55.740> be<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.130> this<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:57.500> little

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
concrete to be at this side a little

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.950 
concrete to be at this side a little
nail<00:00:58.920> there<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:01.700> sculpt<00:01:02.700> it<00:01:02.850> easy

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
nail there and then sculpt it easy

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.870 
nail there and then sculpt it easy
and<00:01:05.960> then<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.229> go<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> other<00:01:06.710> side<00:01:07.070> Lord

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
and then I go to the other side Lord

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.499 
and then I go to the other side Lord
they<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:08.689> a<00:01:08.720> little<00:01:08.960> kneel<00:01:09.170> there<00:01:10.299> they<00:01:11.299> got<00:01:11.479> a

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
they put a little kneel there they got a

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.210 
they put a little kneel there they got a
three-quarter<00:01:11.990> inch<00:01:12.170> pitch<00:01:12.560> here<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.070> then

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
three-quarter inch pitch here so then

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.330 
three-quarter inch pitch here so then
when<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.369> put<00:01:13.640> my<00:01:13.670> board<00:01:14.149> on<00:01:15.159> like<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:18.340> it's

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
when I put my board on like this it's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.749 
when I put my board on like this it's
already<00:01:19.729> set<00:01:20.590> see<00:01:21.590> it's<00:01:21.799> already<00:01:21.979> set<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:22.640> all

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
now we formed our country and the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.180 
now we formed our country and the
biggest<00:01:27.380> thing<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:27.979> don't<00:01:28.310> want<00:01:28.580> have

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
they see people late blocks that let the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.100 
they see people late blocks that let the
concrete<00:01:33.979> go<00:01:34.250> down<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.549> block<00:01:34.670> usually<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.900> big

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
concrete go down the block usually a big

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.190 
concrete go down the block usually a big
mistake<00:01:36.350> because<00:01:36.920> what<00:01:37.340> happens<00:01:37.790> with

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
mistake because what happens with

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.630 
mistake because what happens with
concrete<00:01:39.200> fans<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.950> ships<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.549> everything

going to put black paper over this kind

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490 
going to put black paper over this kind
put<00:01:50.890> my<00:01:51.040> wire<00:01:51.280> mesh<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:52.690> here's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
put my wire mesh in and it for it here's

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.740 
put my wire mesh in and it for it here's
an<00:01:53.770> example<00:01:54.520> right<00:01:54.670> here<00:01:54.730> what<00:01:55.150> I'm<00:01:55.270> talking

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
an example right here what I'm talking

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.620 
an example right here what I'm talking
about<00:01:55.810> how<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.260> concrete<00:01:56.860> will<00:01:57.130> curl<00:01:57.820> up<00:01:57.910> and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
about how the concrete will curl up and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.660 
about how the concrete will curl up and
I'll<00:01:59.080> take<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.470> blocks<00:01:59.740> with<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.340> can<00:02:00.490> see

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
I'll take the blocks with it you can see

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.670 
I'll take the blocks with it you can see
where<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.850> make<00:02:01.000> fingers<00:02:01.480> is<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:02.050> how<00:02:02.320> much<00:02:02.470> I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
where I make fingers is and how much I

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.160 
where I make fingers is and how much I
can<00:02:02.830> go<00:02:02.980> that's<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.210> much<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.720> concrete

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
can go that's how much that concrete

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.420 
can go that's how much that concrete
curled<00:02:05.560> up<00:02:05.740> at<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.070> end

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
curled up at the end

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.510 
curled up at the end
now<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.330> laid<00:02:07.690> my<00:02:07.930> black<00:02:08.320> paper<00:02:08.680> inside<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
now I laid my black paper inside the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.490 
now I laid my black paper inside the
forms<00:02:10.000> because<00:02:10.390> they<00:02:10.510> do<00:02:10.570> not<00:02:10.900> want<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
forms because they do not want the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:30.250 
forms because they do not want the
concrete<00:02:11.740> stick<00:02:12.340> into<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> block<00:02:12.910> below

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.020 

got<00:02:30.739> my<00:02:31.310> concrete<00:02:31.849> board

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
got my concrete board

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.820 
got my concrete board
this<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.690> loading<00:02:35.200> dock<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.710> it's

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
this is like a loading dock and it's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.520 
this is like a loading dock and it's
looked<00:02:36.100> at<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:36.520> video<00:02:36.910> out<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.960> black<00:02:38.230> work

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
looked at my video out of the black work

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.530 
looked at my video out of the black work
the<00:02:39.100> black<00:02:39.340> work<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.790> underneath<00:02:40.180> this

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the black work is underneath this
