00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.330

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.950
 just pass a mini crash there guys it's me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.530
 I wish I was talking to you if you 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.960
 have some mold here so that you 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.690
 open the folder where you have a template 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.370
 and you can even shave this but if 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.850
 drag this here and the witch minecraft 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.830
 not working you back there delete 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.250
 all who have had in this case will be 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.510
 losing all its mold to what it is 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.000
 Then beauty is not even going to crown you . 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.340
 error then you go back in the start menu 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.130
 vidal bet 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.770
 minecraft has already opened its template folder there 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.810
 another that has that is not a straight 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.520
 that excludes beauty people are showing 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 It worked for you all right. 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.120

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.510

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.610

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.030
 that if you could not make the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:19.480
 installation is the manifest point 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:25.310
 It's there for you to download. It 's good too. 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.420

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.860

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.740
 that worked 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.130
 Well, it 's very simple to install it there. 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.740

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.740
