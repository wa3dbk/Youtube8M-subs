when<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:28.800> start<00:00:29.039> sewing<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.939> not

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
when we first start sewing is just not

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.110 
when we first start sewing is just not
knowing<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.800> start<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.640> project

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
knowing what to start with what project

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
knowing what to start with what project
to<00:00:33.210> focus<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.950> practice

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to focus on so if we can just practice

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.819 
to focus on so if we can just practice
with<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:36.690> needle<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> sewing<00:00:37.410> machine<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a piece of paper it might make it a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.850 
a piece of paper it might make it a
little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.500> easier<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.100> started<00:00:42.379> okay<00:00:43.379> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
a feel for the different speed depending

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.740 
a feel for the different speed depending
on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> pressure<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> put<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> foot

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
gonna start with the first line here I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.170 
gonna start with the first line here I'm
going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.290> try<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:24.080> line<00:01:25.080> lined<00:01:25.650> up

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
going to try and get my line lined up

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.670 
going to try and get my line lined up
where<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.869> gap<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:29.310> foot<00:01:29.579> there

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
where the little gap in my foot there

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.819 
where the little gap in my foot there
okay<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.460> tip<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> line<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
okay and the tip of the line is going to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.120 
okay and the tip of the line is going to
be<00:01:34.920> placed<00:01:35.750> where<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> needle<00:01:37.799> will

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
be placed where I think the needle will

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
be placed where I think the needle will
come<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.180> through<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> paper<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
come down through the paper so this is

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
come down through the paper so this is
pretty<00:01:42.689> much<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.170> you'd<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.799> you're

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
pretty much what you'd do if you're

pretty much what you'd do if you're
sewing<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> piece<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.610> fabric<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:47.369> once
