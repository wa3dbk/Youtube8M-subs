00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.610
 hello here martin series last year 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.310
 I made several videos that me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.520
 gray renovation design 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 charm mobility building of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 bath here so I had doors to my 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.279
 friends that I replaced by its doors 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 when I made two boxes here 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.340
 with the strong ones and I also designed 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.140
 this bathroom vanity the round 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 made in ash bread actually it's 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 precisely the time they are causing 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.780
 problem today I was aware 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.170
 i did not think since i'm doing 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 rarely made furniture often play 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.130
 with the natural color of the good bo my 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 maple trees when making 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.770
 doors 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 good with signs all the time because 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.270
 that vanity 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.149
 in fact the same problem on each side 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:11.490
 and well free and not in winter due to 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:14.159
 humidity fluctuations ractis good this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 it is known that the executioner is trail 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 even the reason why a quarter of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.150
 bears an interior name to a door on it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 never sticks just to allow 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.729
 the movement but my nose as well as 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.549
 when we were living x and ractis 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.950
 give a little problem an ungrateful like 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.760
 it rakes the natural color of the noise 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.850
 came back we see very well here the 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.000
 natural color of the panel the town 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.189
 fun because the panel got 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.439
 contracted so the solution is easy 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.049
 it's just that I rent to read what 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.810
 I should have done what my 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.380
 firstly yes again I did the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 choice of colors after when everything 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 was ready for finishing 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.180
 it's a player we would make 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 advances and before gluing brings me 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.120
 together what I should have done is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 sure all the air the tongue is who you turn 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 that enter the groove of doors 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.230
 everything where he was managing to dye this 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 language is 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.260
 even if raw art towards fleas 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.500
 programmable just reach it because 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.330
 the typhoon that if at least by 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.019
 retracting it would have been the same 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.900
 color substantially than is and it does not 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.569
 do not answer but at each of my doors 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.700
 to this little mistake some are not 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.220
 more visible than others and my vanity 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.349
 but the offer is too much gold because 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.980
 I had to be with the dye started 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.989
 to disrupt the foundation the art fund is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.829
 just for match and the color high 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.140
 court 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.470
 governed opio type or again with a very 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.900
 little brush but hey we'll wait 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.810
 that the hostess of a take 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.239
 last year in bordeaux 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.860
 so here it is it was just what 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.450
 I wanted to remind you if you do 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.290
 a project with the borough 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.420
 finally and you have some signs 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.840
 modules that you know that the group had 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.790
 this contact is released a small space where 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.700
 the natural color will come back and I 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.579
 suggest you dye this little 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.180
 space games go out no need to do 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.709
 likewise in full 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.440
 your colleagues you will do the dyeing and 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.269
 behind Roman times but this little 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.639
 word sales has reduced and very haven in 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.739
 sticking 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.739
 it was my little thing of the day thank you
