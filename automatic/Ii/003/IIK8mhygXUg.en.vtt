00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
again I don't think we're going to start

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.690 
again I don't think we're going to start
up<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.300> trick<00:04:53.570> shotting<00:04:53.840> crew<00:04:54.830> clanteam

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
up a trick shotting crew clanteam

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.150 
up a trick shotting crew clanteam
whatever<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:56.840> mean<00:04:57.110> we<00:04:57.230> might<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.680> possible

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
whatever I mean we might it's possible

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.120 
whatever I mean we might it's possible
but<00:04:58.630> if<00:04:59.630> we<00:04:59.990> don't<00:05:00.230> then<00:05:00.590> we'll<00:05:00.740> probably<00:05:00.890> be

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
but if we don't then we'll probably be

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.430 
but if we don't then we'll probably be
joining<00:05:01.550> some<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.060> crap<00:05:02.270> like<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:02.960> i'm

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
joining some and crap like that and i'm

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.790 
joining some and crap like that and i'm
sure<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:05.180> channel<00:05:05.630> will<00:05:05.660> be<00:05:05.810> more<00:05:06.229> known<00:05:06.500> for

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
sure this channel will be more known for

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.650 
sure this channel will be more known for
modding<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.310> stuff<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.820> i'll<00:05:07.970> also<00:05:08.150> use<00:05:08.510> it
