00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
looks like somebody tried to buff it out

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.030 
looks like somebody tried to buff it out
or<00:00:38.309> something<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> deal

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.440 

that's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> worst<00:00:44.430> part<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.300> only

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's the worst part about it the only

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
that's the worst part about it the only
other<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.590> problem<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
other thing I have a problem with it is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
other thing I have a problem with it is
as<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> antenna<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.350> here

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
as you can see on the antenna back here

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
as you can see on the antenna back here
the<00:00:50.340> motor<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.420> antenna<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.289> doesn't

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the motor and the antenna it doesn't

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
the motor and the antenna it doesn't
bring<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> antenna<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.329> push<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
bring the antenna down you can push it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
bring the antenna down you can push it
down<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> comes<00:00:56.340> back<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
down but when it comes back up they

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
down but when it comes back up they
won't<00:00:57.180> go<00:00:57.300> back<00:00:57.480> down<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> only

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
won't go back down so that's the only

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.180 
won't go back down so that's the only
problem<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.949> car

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
see how it's right there that's it I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.010 
see how it's right there that's it I
mean<00:06:47.760> you<00:06:48.000> can<00:06:48.180> see<00:06:48.300> how<00:06:48.360> big<00:06:48.540> it<00:06:48.630> is<00:06:48.690> compared

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
mean you can see how big it is compared

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.510 
mean you can see how big it is compared
to<00:06:49.050> my<00:06:49.200> hand<00:06:50.750> you<00:06:51.750> could<00:06:51.870> probably<00:06:52.740> just<00:06:53.070> bend

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
to my hand you could probably just bend

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.040 
to my hand you could probably just bend
it<00:06:53.700> out<00:06:54.919> but<00:06:56.150> it's<00:06:57.150> not<00:06:57.300> bad<00:06:57.480> that's<00:06:57.780> though<00:06:57.900> if

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
it out but it's not bad that's though if

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.510 
it out but it's not bad that's though if
that's<00:06:58.230> the<00:06:58.320> only<00:06:58.380> thing<00:06:58.800> that's<00:06:59.280> wrong<00:06:59.460> with

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
that's the only thing that's wrong with

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.930 
that's the only thing that's wrong with
it<00:06:59.820> then<00:07:00.360> might<00:07:01.280> do<00:07:02.280> a<00:07:02.310> little<00:07:02.400> with<00:07:02.760> those

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
it then might do a little with those

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.720 
it then might do a little with those
chips<00:07:03.300> but<00:07:03.830> I'm<00:07:04.830> pretty<00:07:05.010> happy<00:07:05.280> with<00:07:05.400> it<00:07:05.520> you

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
of it I know I'll never find another one

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.409 
of it I know I'll never find another one
as<00:07:25.080> clean<00:07:25.290> as<00:07:25.440> this<00:07:25.590> but<00:07:26.090> gotta<00:07:27.090> do<00:07:27.180> what<00:07:27.210> you

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 
as clean as this but gotta do what you

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.010 
as clean as this but gotta do what you
gotta<00:07:27.570> do<00:07:27.780> I<00:07:28.850> love<00:07:29.850> driving<00:07:30.060> it<00:07:30.330> I<00:07:30.540> wish<00:07:30.870> I

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
gotta do I love driving it I wish I

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.480 
gotta do I love driving it I wish I
could<00:07:31.169> keep<00:07:31.320> it<00:07:31.500> and<00:07:31.620> do<00:07:31.740> some<00:07:31.919> more<00:07:31.950> stuff<00:07:32.310> to

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
could keep it and do some more stuff to

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.020 
could keep it and do some more stuff to
it<00:07:32.640> but<00:07:32.850> it's<00:07:33.750> just<00:07:33.930> not<00:07:33.990> not<00:07:34.919> my<00:07:35.190> time<00:07:35.460> range

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
it but it's just not not my time range

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.430 
it but it's just not not my time range
so<00:07:36.770> it<00:07:37.770> will<00:07:37.890> make<00:07:38.010> a<00:07:38.040> good<00:07:38.280> car<00:07:38.520> for<00:07:38.550> somebody

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 
so it will make a good car for somebody

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.130 
so it will make a good car for somebody
that's<00:07:40.440> all<00:07:40.650> I<00:07:40.680> can<00:07:40.830> think<00:07:40.919> of<00:07:41.810> so<00:07:42.810> there<00:07:42.960> you
