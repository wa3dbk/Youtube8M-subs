00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.689
 hello everyone this is fabien I you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.000
 present today a glitch in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 exclusivity normally I say well I have 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 checked but well you never know who has 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 been discovered by crack of 83 kim 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 send a mp on ethics and mimoun 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.329
 frankly I thank you for thinking 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 to me it's a glitch allowing you to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.570
 keep the sight of the missile stand during 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.129
 all the part they are private 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.360
 or public you will have the view of the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.340
 halestorm missile throughout the game 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.510
 whatever you do so if you are 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 at private party you can change 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 of equipment die you commit suicide 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 what you want you will always have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.649
 the view so to do this and well you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 will simply have to get a robot 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.430
 ground and the missile storm 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.020
 naturally you launch your robot 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
 terrestrial once you can the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.699
 control you hold square for the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.510
 control and you do triangle more 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.769
 right arrow 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.780
 at the same time if it went well 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.159
 your one year will flash so then 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 you are right arrow to call 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.830
 your missiles and the storm and you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.229
 make triangle for must to change 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 your tree forgive at the same time if that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.990
 went well when you go 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.970
 change your soul that goes automatically 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.530
 control the land robot by 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 therefore you will control their robots 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.310
 terrestrial and the missile and the storm in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 same time so until then I think that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 This glitch can remember some 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 thing it's the god mode glitch and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.759
 well when you do the god guide 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.259
 mode you do not go out of the robot 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.700
 terrestrial is well there you go out of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.380
 terrestrial robot and when you are 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 released you will still have your missiles 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.850
 Halestorm am about to send on loan 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 you send it it will explode and you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 will simply have the view of the missile 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.399
 halestorm throughout the game 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 Here it's a pretty fun glitch 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.030
 realized a name that he does not strictly serve 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 nothing but can you use it to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 make recordings for your 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.340
 montages for zi for anything 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 or just to have fun 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 it can also be a small technique 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 to help you better aim a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.630
 schoten technique or where you in 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.560
 do what you want I hope that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 this video will have pleased you 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.299
 and I tell you very soon by 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.299
 everybody
