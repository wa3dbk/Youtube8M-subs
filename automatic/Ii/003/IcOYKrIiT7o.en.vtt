00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.200
 remains to know how will not be the last 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.620
 but at the range named moliers to a blocking that was planned 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.110
 between 9 am and noon 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.689
 about travelers 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.269
 and a 24-hour goods block 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.139
 given that we had a great provocation on the part of the management 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.390
 yesterday's sncb 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 so you have to know who they voted 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.519
 for him they voted the plan with the closing of romney and we have it 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.579
 learned by the press interposed so following this 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.610
 our drivers have disengaged and the 24-hour net debt traveler 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.280
 male 22 years old 22 years old 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.020
 especially since last night 22 e 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 until 10 pm tonight 10 pm 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.840
 what does this implantation of his crutches hide something after 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.420
 you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 it is certainly the plan b it is all alone 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.690
 this one privatization 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 and in addition 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 I will say the stranglehold of Flemish on the job and the job roles and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.510
 that's something that is really unacceptable 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.910
 in return the breaks decisions are practically taken by athens and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.420
 surrounding form in the folder what we are concerned about we see 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.970
 when I say we go this Walloon government invested 420 million 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.950
 of euros for the breast tumor this skater was there to pass 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.940
 soldiers poured but italy got me talbott 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 practically abandoned in addition to a Walloon driver 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.180
 you have concluded the Flemish haro may they do like cows and cartons pass 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.740
 the sap trains we can not accept it 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.290
 it is here and at the same time that a closure of rouen and speaks about it is the 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.390
 guingamp closure 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.090
 yes but hughes attention is unique it's never that difficult 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.170
 the transport of the future that of the towels helps some 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.070
 companies are also wanting for them so it's practically no job 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.620
 the troy dutch speakers who will be able to keep the creole dog 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.270
 works at home but in reality this logistic company she sells 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.420
 hardened 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.630
 dockers from the port of Antwerp what we do some work and unfortunately 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.090
 the railwaymen will lose their jobs 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.400
 but the most serious is that we sncb with our money we will have beautiful but 500 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.320
 million 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.300
 to create this society there and it's the Argentine leads active citizens and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.410
 it's something that's really unacceptable if it's not 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.730
 bankruptcy what is predicted we prevail we will redeem for practically created 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.280
 to recall voice bx we left in the same system
