unbreaking 3 efficiency for and I had a
random<00:02:44.409> efficiency<00:02:45.069> for<00:02:45.250> pic<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.640> i<00:02:45.700> just

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
random efficiency for pic so i just

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.559 
random efficiency for pic so i just
upgraded<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.599> efficiency<00:02:47.290> 5<00:02:47.709> now<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
upgraded that to efficiency 5 now that

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.649 
upgraded that to efficiency 5 now that
so<00:02:49.690> many<00:02:49.750> diamond<00:02:50.109> blocks<00:02:50.319> are<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.950> oh<00:02:51.659> is

boy because it's not often you get an

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.960 
boy because it's not often you get an
eight<00:03:26.199> pack<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.709> diamonds<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.489> really<00:03:27.730> isn't

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
eight pack of diamonds it really isn't

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.720 
eight pack of diamonds it really isn't
so<00:03:28.560> let's<00:03:29.560> do<00:03:29.680> something<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.310> BAM

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so let's do something like that BAM

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.059 
so let's do something like that BAM
let's<00:03:31.299> get<00:03:31.419> another<00:03:31.569> angle<00:03:32.019> without<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
let's get another angle without the

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.129 
let's get another angle without the
Oh<00:03:36.260> center<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.439> yeah<00:03:38.099> there<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:38.459> okay<00:03:38.579> so
