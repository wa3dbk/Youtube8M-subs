my Xbox set up and it it receives
perfect<00:02:55.730> signal<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.080> was<00:02:57.230> hooked<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:57.560> to

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
perfect signal as if I was hooked up to

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.890 
perfect signal as if I was hooked up to
the<00:02:57.830> modem<00:02:58.040> by<00:02:58.520> wire<00:02:58.820> was<00:02:59.360> he's<00:02:59.480> perfect

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the modem by wire was he's perfect

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.080

signal<00:03:00.200> through<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.040> concrete<00:03:01.280> walls<00:03:01.730> and

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
signal through the concrete walls and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.229 
signal through the concrete walls and
the<00:03:02.270> roof<00:03:02.510> are<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.410> ceiling<00:03:04.040> my<00:03:04.220> bad

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
so again extremely impressed with it the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.680 
so again extremely impressed with it the
only<00:03:09.500> downside<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.550> costs<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.239> hundred

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
only downside is it costs a hundred

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.530 
only downside is it costs a hundred
dollars<00:03:12.230> which<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.370> lot<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.700> put<00:03:13.970> out<00:03:14.120> but

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
dollars which it's a lot to put out but

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
dollars which it's a lot to put out but
again<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.620> frees<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.220> little<00:03:16.400> bit<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.580> room

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
