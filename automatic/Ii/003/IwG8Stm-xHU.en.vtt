casada you're right skated before her
smell<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.110> Japan<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> she

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
smell was from Japan as we know she

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
smell was from Japan as we know she
delivered<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.180> triple<00:01:51.570> axel<00:01:51.960> which<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
delivered on that triple axel which is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
delivered on that triple axel which is
something<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> kim<00:01:53.280> yu-na<00:01:53.430> does<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
something that kim yu-na does not do so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
something that kim yu-na does not do so
if<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.530> by<00:01:55.560> side<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
if we put them side by side the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
if we put them side by side the
performances<00:01:56.700> explain<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.299> why<00:01:57.509> asada<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
performances explain to me why asada is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.560 
performances explain to me why asada is
in<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.130> place<00:01:59.159> well<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:01:59.790> going<00:02:00.000> easiest

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in second place well I'm going easiest

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.060 
in second place well I'm going easiest
way<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.719> explain<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> triple<00:02:01.530> axel<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.009> an

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
way to explain as a triple axel is an

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
way to explain as a triple axel is an
extraordinary<00:02:02.579> achievement<00:02:02.700> triple<00:02:03.420> axel

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
extraordinary achievement triple axel

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
extraordinary achievement triple axel
but<00:02:04.229> she<00:02:04.409> ends<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> combination<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
but she ends the combination with a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490 
but she ends the combination with a
double<00:02:06.180> toe<00:02:06.329> loop<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> add<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> rotations

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
double toe loop so you add the rotations

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
double toe loop so you add the rotations
three<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> half<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> triple<00:02:08.879> axel<00:02:09.030> two

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
three and a half for a triple axel two

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.600 
three and a half for a triple axel two
for<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> double<00:02:10.709> toe<00:02:10.830> loop<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.190> five<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
for a double toe loop that's five and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.040 
for a double toe loop that's five and
half<00:02:11.700> revolutions<00:02:12.239> triple<00:02:12.930> triple

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
half revolutions triple triple

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.770 
half revolutions triple triple
combination

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
combination

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.120 
combination
not<00:02:13.930> only<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.350> keep<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.709> speed<00:02:14.950> off

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
not only you have to keep the speed off

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.620 
not only you have to keep the speed off
the<00:02:15.250> first<00:02:15.459> trip<00:02:15.670> Bowl<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.569> do

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
the first trip Bowl but you have to do

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.270 
the first trip Bowl but you have to do
another<00:02:16.900> triple<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> landing<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:17.800> six

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
another triple on the landing that's six

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.100 
another triple on the landing that's six
revolutions<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.569> actually<00:02:19.900> worth<00:02:20.080> more

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
revolutions so it's actually worth more

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.920 
revolutions so it's actually worth more
points<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.160> much<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.880> triple<00:02:22.240> axel<00:02:22.390> mile

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
points so as much as a triple axel mile

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.180 
points so as much as a triple axel mile
is<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.110> only<00:02:23.290> woman<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> world<00:02:23.860> that's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
is the only woman in the world that's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.590 
is the only woman in the world that's
done<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:24.670> done<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.180> first<00:02:25.420> time

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
done it's done it and the first time

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.760 
done it's done it and the first time
Olympic<00:02:25.959> history<00:02:26.050> has<00:02:26.350> been<00:02:26.470> done<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.709> the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
Olympic history has been done in the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.740 
Olympic history has been done in the
short<00:02:26.950> program<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:28.240> still<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> half<00:02:28.720> a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
short program it's still a half a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.479 
short program it's still a half a
revolution<00:02:28.959> less<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> triple<00:02:30.400> triple

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
revolution less and so a triple triple

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.000 
revolution less and so a triple triple
combination<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.330> still<00:02:31.930> much<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.230> difficult

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
combination is still much more difficult

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.820 
combination is still much more difficult
and<00:02:33.580> very<00:02:33.819> quickly<00:02:34.150> Kim<00:02:34.450> Yuna<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.720> almost<00:02:35.590> five

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and very quickly Kim Yuna is almost five

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.290 
and very quickly Kim Yuna is almost five
points<00:02:36.130> ahead<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.400> everybody<00:02:36.610> else<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.150> she

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
points ahead of everybody else is she

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.880 
points ahead of everybody else is she
catchable<00:02:40.020> she's<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.410> really

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
catchable she's going to have to really

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.949 
catchable she's going to have to really
fall<00:02:42.370> apart<00:02:42.400> okay<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.390> anybody<00:02:43.569> else<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
fall apart okay for anybody else to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.840 
fall apart okay for anybody else to
catch<00:02:44.140> her<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.280> was<00:02:45.489> saying

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
catch her in you know I was saying

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.820 
catch her in you know I was saying
earlier<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.660> one<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> best<00:02:47.290> biographies

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
earlier the one of the best biographies

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.340 
earlier the one of the best biographies
I've<00:02:47.980> ever<00:02:48.130> read<00:02:48.370> was<00:02:48.550> Seabiscuit<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
I've ever read was Seabiscuit and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.270 
I've ever read was Seabiscuit and
Seabiscuit<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.380> known<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.890> breaking<00:02:51.070> down

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Seabiscuit was known for breaking down

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.699 
Seabiscuit was known for breaking down
other<00:02:51.580> horses<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.320> her

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
other horses and when I look at her

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.860 
other horses and when I look at her
biggest<00:02:53.920> competition<00:02:54.220> like<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.720> knows

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
biggest competition like you knows

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.110 
biggest competition like you knows
biggest<00:02:56.200> competition<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.739> Mao<00:02:56.950> Mao<00:02:57.820> is<00:02:57.970> going

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
biggest competition is Mao Mao is going

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720 
biggest competition is Mao Mao is going
to<00:02:58.180> triple<00:02:58.780> axels<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.350> two<00:02:59.440> triple<00:02:59.709> flips<00:02:59.950> but

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
to triple axels and two triple flips but

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.309 
to triple axels and two triple flips but
that<00:03:01.209> probably<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.720> going<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:02.050> enough

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
that probably is going to be enough

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.530 
that probably is going to be enough
because<00:03:02.530> when<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.610> add<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.000> points<00:03:04.209> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
because when you add up the points and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.780 
because when you add up the points and
when<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> look<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.019> what<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:06.100> Kim<00:03:06.550> Yuna<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
when you look at what what Kim Yuna is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.199 
when you look at what what Kim Yuna is
rewarded<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.830> it's<00:03:09.250> perfect<00:03:09.850> skating

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
rewarded for that it's perfect skating

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.990 
rewarded for that it's perfect skating
