00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello big little lovers 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 dance with you tour i present to your 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.950
 attention to the replay on the Soviet lung 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 tank third level nature of t-127 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 you can get this tank yourself 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 collection or just if you start 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.430
 I recommend you to play him 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.380
 buy it very good farm 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 very pleasant to learn and you can 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 very good and with great 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.120
 pleasure to bend down why 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 what will help us help us first 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 turn a good gun which has 51 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 penetration and 47 damage per shot 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.149
 fast enough approaching like 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 see 2 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:55.079
 42 this is why she is also not top me 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 that's what else we have we have 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 very good armor at 40 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.039
 millimeters 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.270
 forehead 30 on the sides and 20 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.510
 this is 30 from behind and the tower is 40 meters 30 and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.330
 25 behind in general are wonderful 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 booking a good speaker dynamics 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 of course a little bit weak for the lung 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.340
 tank 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 but nevertheless I would not call in the light 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.210
 tanks know this rather average 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.979
 the tank really needs a medium heavy 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 in the presence of good armor which 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.720
 sometimes it keeps damage fast enough 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 moves and causes quite good 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.159
 the shot hits quite accurately here 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.890
 watch the clock will demonstrate here by 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.960
 ass who forever on small 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 levels fly to this side 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 prokhorovke well and because he can not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.159
 can punch us though very much but 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 can not naturally in the forehead 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 such a tank he did not punch them or on the go 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.080
 affairs shells fly the most different parties 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.140
 he must act differently 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.290
 and in the meantime we use the light and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 we shoot everything here very well 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.630
 the gun goes down allowing 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.100
 kind of play them like the american 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.010
 tanks we notice here artillery and what 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
 we do of course will shoot by 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.350
 artillery 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.990
 although at these levels it is not so 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.220
 dangerous but still in the body always 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.580
 You can bring an unpleasant surprise and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.430
 better get rid of her right away 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.770
 generally advantageous difference of this tank in 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.580
 that at his third level he has 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.000
 have a gun as you know machine guns 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.300
 there is a significant minus this limitation 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.350
 300 meters away the gun is the same 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.600
 allows you to shoot 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.190
 Well, in general, at least 400 meters and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 you see, shoot a good knife here 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.890
 quietly stands on the center we put 404 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.320
 damage and even I would say more with 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.260
 considering to shoot agendas and 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.239
 half the enemy team already takes 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.330
 its place of honor in the hangar 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.120
 and we nevertheless continue to exchange 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.800
 shoot someone else's light 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.360
 as 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.900
 enough despite the fact that the circle 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.590
 the information seems very large but not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.800
 less he let's switch now to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.760
 real mode it is very very accurate 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.340
 sends shells to the center of the circle 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.800
 see 1 1 1 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 a lot of shells goes where 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.260
 need and thanks to that we are calm 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.280
 confidently laying out our enemies 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.099
 she us three sheets 82 it is obviously a mine 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.959
 or armor goes to the harp silly and 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.269
 five frags have been ineffective for you 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.209
 but here the eternal struggle begins 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.120
 do you know for the warrior the team tries as 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.620
 quicker you can take this one from 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.590
 any of the five remaining 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.410
 mates to not leave you to you 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.840
 by no means got a warrior all 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.600
 construction wait while you are there by 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.139
 get off while you're there Razik 2 you bet 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.830
 but no no no no everything sucks but 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.870
 it is natural this scheme is known and in 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.820
 overall not surprising therefore 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.830
 earn your honestly earned on 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.220
 my mind is a warrior we set off 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.340
 naturally look forward to our 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.699
 dear friends hope that guys 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.870
 with machine guns although thereâ€™s hardly much 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.590
 will let him lose so beautiful 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.740
 medal what it really is on 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.470
 t-127 no problem getting there 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.840
 warriors and so on there is no look 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.849
 we meet the same friend with us and 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.030
 we can say it is not very, very 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.710
 weak sides 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.169
 lobovuha it is located under some 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.919
 common not a bad angle and often she 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.039
 all the same 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.440
 racer yes we take our warrior 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.599
 often absorbs its earlier though 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.720
 here I didn't even manage them practically 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.820
 see that no one shot but 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.560
 no less than your rival level 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:29.490
 often enough damage it absorbs 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.790
 Well of course the gun sometimes sometimes 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.120
 punches but more often projectile perfectly 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.300
 enters that is confident and breaking through 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.800
 Remarkable armor 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.290
 great for your level and in general 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.120
 not bad mobility give us quite 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.630
 opportunity yourself comfortable and with 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.210
 pleasure to play this 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.000
 tanke 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.340
 days dear viewers here such here 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.240
 replays hope that you will need it 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.340
 I will try to continue making replays by 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.950
 premium tank for you to choose whom 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.010
 you will still buy and for whom 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.020
 it will be nice and happy to farm 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.729
 silver and generally just play by 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.940
 his fan was on tour 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.669
 thumb up + subscription is big 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.229
 thank you so much for 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.229
 looked to new meetings
