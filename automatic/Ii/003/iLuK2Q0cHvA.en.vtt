i'm going to jump up and down and be
hard<00:01:53.890> on<00:01:54.039> them<00:01:54.189> for<00:01:54.399> not<00:01:54.460> announcing<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.939> 101

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
hard on them for not announcing on 101

hard on them for not announcing on 101
film<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:55.630> actually<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:57.310> know<00:01:57.429> I've<00:01:57.700> always

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
film but actually you know I've always

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.249 
film but actually you know I've always
said<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.420> thought<00:01:58.719> they<00:01:58.929> need<00:01:59.109> to

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
said that I thought they need to

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.569 
said that I thought they need to
establish<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.770> lot<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.159> these<00:02:00.249> smaller

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
establish a lot of these smaller

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.190 
establish a lot of these smaller
characters<00:02:00.939> first<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.810> movie<00:02:02.049> with

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
characters first in a movie with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380 
characters first in a movie with
Superman<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.740> Batman<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.189> I<00:02:03.789> think<00:02:04.119> it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
Superman and Batman and I think it's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.120 
Superman and Batman and I think it's
okay<00:02:04.869> sometimes<00:02:05.380> for<00:02:05.530> Warner<00:02:05.710> Brothers<00:02:05.740> step

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
okay sometimes for Warner Brothers step

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.370 
okay sometimes for Warner Brothers step
back<00:02:06.249> and<00:02:06.399> say<00:02:06.520> look<00:02:07.509> everything<00:02:08.170> looks
