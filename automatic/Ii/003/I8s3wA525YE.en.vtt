00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello everyone, today I would like to do 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.480
 her grandmother's little gift she 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.780
 uses here such fucking 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.139
 garden sticks 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.830
 that is, we are stretching and , as it were, 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.750
 the ropes we start to dig along 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.730
 vegetable garden that is to make even 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.460
 a bed and convenient to have it here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 uses such thing now closer 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 I'll show you here and decided to do more 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.239
 such comfortable and durable but 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 actually so it does not look that is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.489
 such here is completely wooden bad 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.980
 very stuck is not convenient especially when 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.670
 the earth is tough here too 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 wooden 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.879
 Slightly sharpened this one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.950
 metal with a tip such 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.860
 plastic, so I decided to make 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:00.180
 From such a bar aluminum will be just 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.340
 three pairs 1 2 another 3 will be stock well 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's start two 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.450
 I already sawed off a tip 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.640
 about 250 millimeters each 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.320
 me not 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.320
 Now we will do the markup here. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 saw off 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:02:00.490
 after she cut 6 twigs 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:10.570
 take the marker line and mark 85 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:13.480
 millimeters somewhere like this then take 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.930
 butter usually any butter there machines and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.930
 something like that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.930
 ramazan 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 take the die m12 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.780
 and begin now begin now 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.920
 neatly thread just 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.920
 cinema to the end that is 85 millimeters 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.599
 but actually what we did after 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:39.680
 as we cut the thread remove the nut and 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:44.569
 twist to the end we also with 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.970
 next after clocked up 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:53.769
 nuts take the usual garden hose 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.769
 and cut off about 70 millimeters 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:26.480
 then take our tube and from here 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:29.200
 neatly whisk now take 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.200
 thread lock 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:50.890
 neatly thread we coat take 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.890
 nut and twist 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.659
 Well, that's all well, actually such here 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.159
 sticks turned out pretty comfortable 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:11.729
 the handle also sharpened them in my 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:14.370
 much better than it was now 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.439
 drilled a hole here for this 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.439
 rope and already test 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.060
 but actually I wrapped the rope now 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.060
 let's go test in the garden 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.670
 not true 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.350
 reset large 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.260
 that's actually all grandmothers very 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.770
 like this gift I hope you 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.760
 also liked the design itself 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.220
 maybe someone will adopt 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.260
 imagine someone might as well something like that 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.270
 make it anyone liked the video
