00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.340 

then<00:01:24.159> practice<00:01:24.399> playing<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.000> back<00:01:25.179> down<00:01:25.450> see

then practice playing it back down see
the<00:01:27.219> peg<00:01:30.119> g-m-e<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:32.729> C<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.770> notice<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the peg g-m-e the C now notice the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.899 
the peg g-m-e the C now notice the
pattern<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.630> how<00:01:37.840> we're<00:01:38.020> playing<00:01:38.229> this

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pattern here of how we're playing this

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.660 
pattern here of how we're playing this
is<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:41.380> about<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.770> as<00:01:41.890> far<00:01:42.069> as<00:01:42.100> what<00:01:42.310> fingers

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
is think about it as far as what fingers

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.340 
is think about it as far as what fingers
are<00:01:42.819> using<00:01:43.209> you're<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.929> to<00:01:44.289> four<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:46.689> two

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
are using you're going to four one two

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.190 
are using you're going to four one two
four<00:01:47.979> one<00:01:49.140> three<00:01:50.140> four<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.799> play<00:01:55.200> another

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
four one three four now to play another

four one three four now to play another
scale<00:01:56.709> such<00:01:57.130> as<00:01:57.159> G<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:59.470> basically<00:01:59.979> just<00:02:00.189> start

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
scale such as G you basically just start

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.679 
scale such as G you basically just start
the<00:02:00.759> pattern<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:02.409> your<00:02:02.770> jig<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:04.060> move<00:02:04.360> up<00:02:04.509> here

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
the pattern on your jig so move up here

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.449 
the pattern on your jig so move up here
to<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.959> E<00:02:04.989> string<00:02:05.469> here<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.770> your<00:02:05.890> third<00:02:06.069> fret

to the E string here on your third fret
and<00:02:06.909> play<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:07.329> same<00:02:07.539> pattern<00:02:08.019> there<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.259> have

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
and play the same pattern there you have

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.170 
and play the same pattern there you have
your<00:02:08.560> G<00:02:08.920> major<00:02:08.950> scale<00:02:09.549> so<00:02:09.849> it's<00:02:10.650> two<00:02:11.650> four<00:02:12.310> one

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
flats on the scale with G there's one

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.420 
flats on the scale with G there's one
sharp<00:02:27.579> it's<00:02:28.209> F<00:02:28.389> sharp<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.620> say<00:02:29.889> tonight's<00:02:30.250> as

3<00:03:01.549> 4<00:03:03.860> go<00:03:04.860> down<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> 1<00:03:06.150> 3<00:03:07.140> 4<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.610> then<00:03:09.299> down

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
3 4 go down to the a 1 3 4 and then down

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.880 
3 4 go down to the a 1 3 4 and then down
the<00:03:09.720> D<00:03:10.220> 1<00:03:11.220> 3<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.540> saying<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.110> it's<00:03:16.319> as<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.650> play

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the D 1 3 so saying that it's as we play

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:29.420 
the D 1 3 so saying that it's as we play
them<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:18.329> have<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:20.660> see<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.829> e<00:03:25.730> G

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:40.069 

and<00:03:29.970> back<00:03:30.239> down<00:03:37.310> now<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:39.000> realize<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.810> a

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
and back down now we realize here is a

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.520 
and back down now we realize here is a
also<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:41.250> minor's<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.360> say<00:03:42.540> also<00:03:42.870> doesn't<00:03:43.409> have

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
also a minor's and say also doesn't have

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.699 
also a minor's and say also doesn't have
any<00:03:43.709> sharps<00:03:44.099> or<00:03:44.250> flats<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.790> scale<00:03:45.090> so

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
any sharps or flats in the scale so

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.630 
any sharps or flats in the scale so
essentially<00:03:46.709> C<00:03:47.099> major<00:03:47.930> has<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.500> same<00:03:50.370> notes

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
essentially C major has the same notes

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.229 
essentially C major has the same notes
in<00:03:50.819> its<00:03:50.939> scale<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.390> E<00:03:51.540> minor<00:03:52.849> differences<00:03:53.849> is

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
in its scale as E minor differences is

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.910 
in its scale as E minor differences is
what<00:03:54.299> key<00:03:54.900> are<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.140> playing<00:03:55.439> in<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.799> you're

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
what key are you playing in if you're

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.339 
what key are you playing in if you're
playing<00:03:56.129> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> key<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.609> C<00:04:02.930> sounds<00:04:03.930> different

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
playing in the key of C sounds different

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.369 
playing in the key of C sounds different
than<00:04:04.500> if<00:04:04.620> you're<00:04:04.769> playing<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.159> E<00:04:05.250> minor

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379

out<00:04:19.130> what<00:04:19.820> major<00:04:20.060> scale<00:04:20.509> has<00:04:21.169> two<00:04:21.320> same<00:04:21.530> notes

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
out what major scale has two same notes

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.600 
out what major scale has two same notes
in<00:04:21.949> it<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:22.280> what<00:04:23.000> minor<00:04:23.270> scale<00:04:24.310> will<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.340> thumb

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
in it as what minor scale will a thumb

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.550 
in it as what minor scale will a thumb
here<00:04:25.960> here's<00:04:26.960> our<00:04:27.169> C<00:04:27.789> and<00:04:28.789> if<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.990> move<00:04:30.110> down

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
here here's our C and if you move down

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.310 
here here's our C and if you move down
one<00:04:30.889> string<00:04:31.389> such<00:04:32.389> as<00:04:32.600> going<00:04:32.810> out<00:04:32.990> from<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.289> a

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
one string such as going out from the a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.170 
one string such as going out from the a
to<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.770> e<00:04:33.860> here<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:35.210> then<00:04:35.330> go<00:04:35.449> down<00:04:35.690> two<00:04:36.050> frets

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
to the e here and then go down two frets

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.430 
to the e here and then go down two frets
that<00:04:38.180> gives<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.750> equivalent<00:04:39.080> minor

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
that gives you the equivalent minor

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.050 
that gives you the equivalent minor
scale<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:41.300> C<00:04:42.080> major<00:04:42.520> that's<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.639> same<00:04:43.849> that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
scale so C major that's the same that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.839 
scale so C major that's the same that
it's<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.479> as<00:04:46.270> knee<00:04:47.270> minor<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:49.190> can<00:04:49.250> also<00:04:49.460> do

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
it's in it as knee minor you can also do

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.770 
it's in it as knee minor you can also do
that<00:04:50.000> with<00:04:50.060> let's<00:04:50.990> say<00:04:51.199> we're<00:04:51.380> doing<00:04:51.520> D<00:04:52.520> major

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
that with let's say we're doing D major

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.650 
that with let's say we're doing D major
getting<00:04:55.780> on<00:04:55.870> one<00:04:55.990> string<00:04:56.380> whoever<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.660> seen

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
getting on one string whoever to seen

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.490 
getting on one string whoever to seen

tip for you now there's various
different<00:05:07.690> ways<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:08.260> play<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.560> same<00:05:08.740> scale

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.700 

so<00:05:13.540> what<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.020> want<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.260> do<00:05:14.350> is<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.530> want<00:05:14.680> to

practice such as your si remembering the
notes<00:05:18.340> in<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.550> scale<00:05:18.640> I'm<00:05:19.150> learning<00:05:19.420> how<00:05:19.540> to

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
notes in the scale I'm learning how to

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.090 
notes in the scale I'm learning how to
play<00:05:19.870> at<00:05:19.990> different<00:05:20.320> ways<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.770> your<00:05:20.890> fret

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
play at different ways on your fret

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.660 
play at different ways on your fret
board<00:05:21.370> we<00:05:21.630> could<00:05:22.630> do<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:22.900> here<00:05:23.200> but<00:05:23.350> there's

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
board we could do that here but there's

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.450 
board we could do that here but there's
several<00:05:24.670> different<00:05:24.790> ways<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.300> do<00:05:25.450> that<00:05:25.600> so

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
several different ways to do that so

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.540 
several different ways to do that so
there's<00:05:27.460> your<00:05:27.610> basic<00:05:27.850> major<00:05:28.480> minor<00:05:29.140> scale<00:05:29.680> so

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
there's your basic major minor scale so

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.300 
there's your basic major minor scale so
