thought<00:02:27.489> see<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.850> sort<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> thing

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.910 

good<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.319> ton<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.530> Mitchell's<00:02:32.830> or

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
good there's a ton of Mitchell's or

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.860 
good there's a ton of Mitchell's or
childx<00:02:33.370> running<00:02:33.640> around<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.000> oath<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.540> decent

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
childx running around and oath is decent

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.240 
childx running around and oath is decent
against<00:02:35.110> those<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.500> don't<00:02:35.799> really<00:02:36.010> want<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
against those I don't really want to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.580 
against those I don't really want to
play<00:02:36.340> against<00:02:36.549> for<00:02:36.640> workshops<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.780> don't

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
play against for workshops but I don't

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.809 
play against for workshops but I don't
really<00:02:38.769> know<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.040> doesn't<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.519> like<00:02:39.549> any

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
really know it doesn't have like any

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.910 
really know it doesn't have like any
insane<00:02:40.360> matchups<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:41.110> fairly<00:02:41.470> solid

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
insane matchups it's just fairly solid

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.649 
insane matchups it's just fairly solid
against<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.250> field<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.150> reason<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.480> is

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
against the field so the reason it is

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.940 
against the field so the reason it is
good<00:02:43.840> against<00:02:44.019> workshop<00:02:44.349> decks<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.799> just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
good against workshop decks is it just

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.800 
good against workshop decks is it just
has<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.730> mana<00:02:45.940> card<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.540> is

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
has this like to mana card that is

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.150 
has this like to mana card that is
really<00:02:47.049> hard<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.260> him<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.440> beat<00:02:47.620> other<00:02:47.950> than

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
really hard for him to beat other than

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.350 
really hard for him to beat other than
that<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.519> normal<00:02:48.849> blue<00:02:49.000> deck<00:02:49.150> which

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
that it's like a normal blue deck which

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.970 
that it's like a normal blue deck which
isn't<00:02:49.540> great<00:02:49.750> against<00:02:50.049> workshops<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.709> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
isn't great against workshops but the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.380 
isn't great against workshops but the
addition<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.370> both<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.610> think<00:02:51.640> does<00:02:52.000> go<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> long

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
addition of both I think does go a long

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
addition of both I think does go a long
way<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.170> worst<00:02:53.349> matchup<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:53.920> oath<00:02:54.099> is<00:02:54.370> I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
way the worst matchup for oath is I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.809 
way the worst matchup for oath is I
don't<00:02:56.410> even<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.680> probably<00:02:57.069> some<00:02:57.340> deck<00:02:57.670> that

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
don't even know probably some deck that

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.280 
don't even know probably some deck that
