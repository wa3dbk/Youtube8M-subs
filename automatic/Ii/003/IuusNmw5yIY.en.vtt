00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
not look like x-men number one so that's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.149 
not look like x-men number one so that's
kind<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> disappointing<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.740> does<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.070> look

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
kind of disappointing this does not look

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.260 
kind of disappointing this does not look
like<00:01:38.250> Gimli<00:01:38.549> art<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.119> looks

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
like Gimli art but it actually looks

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.460 
like Gimli art but it actually looks
like<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:42.630> cool<00:01:42.810> comic<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.229> looks<00:01:43.380> like

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
like a pretty cool comic it looks like

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.550 
like a pretty cool comic it looks like
sort<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> origin<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:45.140> gambit<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.290> little

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
sort of the origin of gambit a little

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
sort of the origin of gambit a little
bit<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.009> there's<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.420> there's<00:01:48.420> like

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
bit and there's some there's like

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
bit and there's some there's like
Sabretooth<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.950> bunch<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.520> people

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
Sabretooth and a bunch of other people

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
Sabretooth and a bunch of other people
hanging<00:01:51.509> around<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:52.950> read<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hanging around so I'm gonna read this

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
hanging around so I'm gonna read this
later<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> definitely<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.899> x-men

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
later but this is definitely not x-men

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
later but this is definitely not x-men
number<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
number one which is kind of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.740 
number one which is kind of
disappointing<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.689> at

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
disappointing now I'm going to look at

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
disappointing now I'm going to look at
each<00:01:57.869> figure<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> time<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.399> get

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
each figure one at a time so you can get

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.319 
each figure one at a time so you can get
a<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.939> each<00:02:00.060> one

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
a good look at each one

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.410 
a good look at each one
this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> gambit<00:02:01.710> first<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.909> said<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> does

that is kind of surprising I didn't

good detail it's kind of flowing up to
the<00:02:54.350> side<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.860> gives<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> animated<00:02:56.000> look<00:02:56.210> to

it and his feet also do not have any

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
articulation so whereas this is mostly a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.980 
articulation so whereas this is mostly a
new<00:03:04.130> sculpt<00:03:04.670> I'm<00:03:04.850> not<00:03:05.180> seeing<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.570> lot<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.840> reuse

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
more of a universe figures but I don't

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.870 
more of a universe figures but I don't
think<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.140> articulation<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.700> he's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
think that the articulation that he's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.570 
think that the articulation that he's
liking<00:03:17.300> is<00:03:17.390> going<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.800> hinder<00:03:18.800> his<00:03:19.130> pose
