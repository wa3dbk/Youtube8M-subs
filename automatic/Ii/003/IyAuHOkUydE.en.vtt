00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 thank you very much everyone for your help 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.230
 I am here to serve you, they already know it and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.230
 so let's start with this, which is the video 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.690
 tutorial good first of all the line 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.000
 fire they are very famous in 10 water 3 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.829
 for having a very high difficulty without 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.980
 Be too much 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.199
 too good too showy well 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.690
 that without more or more we start good in 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.080
 this part as you can see first 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.140
 which is marked is the center of our 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.810
 from our view of our screen and what 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 which can be in the blind fire zone 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.570
 which is precisely a diagonal 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.920
 some inclined the point that is 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.649
 solved good the point that was 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.509
 alone is the center then the line 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.909
 that runs below the point is 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.250
 precisely the area of blind fire a 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.869
 thing before crossing the video many 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.270
 they will say good but with this the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.950
 more expert does not come out better, of course 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.890
 no this video is just a small 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.479
 hint about what are the fair wines 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.240
 from what is its beginning to its 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.850
 final good then they will imagine 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.940
 that will be nothing else to mark and scratch 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.179
 your TV no but not the joke of this is 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.119
 try to have some perspective 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.009
 of what can be the point of view 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.520
 of your rifle sorry from the tip of your 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.070
 sniper rifle have more or less a 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.750
 a small a little suspicion about 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.670
 where will the bullet go because of the same 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.950
 they are not pointing they do not have the same 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.739
 direction they can all shoot 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.349
 hundreds of shots and everyone will go to 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.150
 different directions except for 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.860
 the active recharges in the recharges 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.209
 active has a little more than 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 direction towards what is the area of 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.140
 mind fire the blind fer most 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.319
 Sometimes they are given for one by one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.780
 active recharge then then let's start 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.560
 in this part you can see we are 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.090
 trying to make a wine fair all 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.829
 them with the and when they are subscribers 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.290
 lie they are friends of mine thank you for 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.360
 be here the same and you can see 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.400
 this point as you see is already marked 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.819
 center point and the diagonal in this 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.150
 moment I'm following me well and see 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.069
 the area of ​​blind fire is practically 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.680
 where is your skull that is right now 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.599
 what is going to be the line fire then 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.269
 they can see that not all the time 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.060
 base to the same place is the closest 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.269
 of it and as it is close 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.810
 It is also close to the sniper between more 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.330
 near are the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.700
 the blind fire with the sniper are more 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.680
 easy to more distances are very much 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.209
 more difficult good 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.950
 we continue with another this only the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.050
 first then then let's continue 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.460
 in this because if you can see I am 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.330
 walking I'm not moving 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.070
 so then you can practically see what 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.360
 I'm trying to measure to focus on what 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.970
 which is the slayer area and ready 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.760
 they will realize that it is also a bit 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.560
 changed is not much the difference but 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.270
 among more active recharges I tell you 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.180
 It's easier 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.610
 come in this there when we fill the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.540
 area that we can that can serve us 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.540
 It is immediately below the first gear 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.830
 which is lower left on 13 and the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.980
 gear that is further to the left 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.810
 still in the practically near 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.910
 our player can also serve us 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.130
 as an indication of these areas of the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.830
 blind faith then I'm no longer 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.080
 trying to focus I do not give it but come 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.720
 since the point is marked not always 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.520
 they go out to the first one or all of them see between 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.020
 closer I tell you this the closer 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.290
 is the enemy of our tip of 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.040
 our easiest sniper result 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.440
 these links go 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.780
 can see I'm trying to give all the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.960
 sorry to the sleeping body and there it is 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.100
 that's very very good also having 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.350
 more or less the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.740
 the sense this is a very good trick 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.750
 I want you to see this trick is not the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.650
 great thing is not so difficult is not so 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.040
 so striking but if it gives a lot of 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.020
 a little bit of level could be said but 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.890
 can see me I throw it up it rises to 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.320
 that is all 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.630
 precisely that is calculating what is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.510
 to black fire person the blind fire with 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.760
 what your shot can be is the classic 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.050
 for people who are with leagues or 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.010
 that you want to approach them and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.870
 make them some kind of death 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.680
 striking because precisely doing this 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.380
 for the fences the mines 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.060
 well, this is line fire 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.150
 just a sample of what they can 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.740
 be not with this tutorial that you see it 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.020
 they are going to be the most expert you need 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.509
 of practice more than anything but then I know 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.350
 that all of you are good and I know how 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.330
 they're going to get it, so I think 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.280
 that there is no more for the time being 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.830
 doubt any comment can 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.919
 post it below this video on my 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.310
 channel or in my networks is a video 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.860
 basic but a lot of tutorial 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.050
 very important help so I think 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.270
 that for now it 's all 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.740
 anything help them finger comment 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.889
 you can post it here below the pse 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.570
 video a souls I say goodbye I hope they 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.729
 have served thanks to these people

 that did not get to record the video 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.110
