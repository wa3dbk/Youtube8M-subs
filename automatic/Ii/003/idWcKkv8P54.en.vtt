00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
let's speak about the new components the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.570 
let's speak about the new components the
menu<00:01:52.229> major<00:01:52.410> components<00:01:52.950> first<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
menu major components first of all the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.330 
menu major components first of all the
ng<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.210> water-cooled<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.590> valve<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
ng that is water-cooled for valve and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.660 
ng that is water-cooled for valve and
it's<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.720> big<00:01:57.930> amount<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> power<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.550> we

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's with the big amount of power so we

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's with the big amount of power so we
have<00:02:00.020> 135<00:02:01.020> horsepower<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.369> above<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.200> good

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
have 135 horsepower but above all a good

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.930 
have 135 horsepower but above all a good
torque<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:04.830> every<00:02:05.369> range

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
torque at every range

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.109 
torque at every range
so<00:02:06.539> there's<00:02:06.840> mootness<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:08.160> big<00:02:08.310> dork<00:02:08.640> at

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so there's mootness and a big dork at

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.190 
so there's mootness and a big dork at
all<00:02:09.600> our<00:02:09.810> reps<00:02:10.910> another<00:02:12.110> important<00:02:13.110> feature

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
all our reps another important feature

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
all our reps another important feature
of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.620> engine<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.400> frame<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
of the engine is that the frame the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:15.680 
of the engine is that the frame the
subframe

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
subframe

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750

head<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.100> our<00:02:20.400> panicle<00:02:21.090> our<00:02:21.269> top<00:02:21.570> of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
head and like the our panicle our top of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.259 
head and like the our panicle our top of
the<00:02:21.720> range<00:02:21.959> my<00:02:22.430> another<00:02:23.430> big<00:02:23.730> improvement

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
the range my another big improvement

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.570 
the range my another big improvement
respected<00:02:24.690> past<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.500> riding<00:02:26.459> position

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
respected past is the riding position

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.080 
respected past is the riding position
but<00:02:27.209> now<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.660> handle<00:02:28.380> bar<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.799> raised<00:02:29.580> up<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
but now they handle bar is raised up of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.780 
but now they handle bar is raised up of
40<00:02:30.510> millimeters<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.980> near<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.640> the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
basically it gave me all the time I need

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:27.330 
basically it gave me all the time I need
to<00:04:09.720> go<00:04:09.810> out<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.050> assess<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> bike

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.490 

I<00:04:27.370> think<00:04:28.060> demo<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.420> program<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.960> very

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
I think demo and program is a very

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.470 
I think demo and program is a very
important<00:04:30.040> test<00:04:30.639> riding<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> bike<00:04:31.120> before<00:04:31.300> you

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
important test riding a bike before you

important test riding a bike before you
buy<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:32.080> think<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.440> one<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.620> those<00:04:32.740> important

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
buy I think is one of those important

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.560 
buy I think is one of those important
