00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
eating them and it looks like they'll

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.420 
eating them and it looks like they'll
take<00:02:58.870> them<00:02:59.049> awhile<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.349> get<00:02:59.680> through<00:02:59.980> them<00:03:00.190> I

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
take them awhile to get through them I

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.089 
take them awhile to get through them I
like<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.060> split<00:03:01.450> ones<00:03:01.690> they<00:03:02.620> seem<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.980> like

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
like the split ones they seem to like

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.740 
like the split ones they seem to like
them<00:03:03.340> better<00:03:03.459> than<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> whole<00:03:04.060> ones<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.569> last

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
them better than the whole ones the last

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.750 
them better than the whole ones the last
ones<00:03:05.019> we<00:03:05.170> got<00:03:05.319> we're<00:03:05.560> whole<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:06.280> are<00:03:06.519> halves

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
ones we got we're whole these are halves

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.270 
ones we got we're whole these are halves
so<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.510> think<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:08.440> really<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> halves

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
so I think they really like the halves

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.800 
so I think they really like the halves
cuz<00:03:09.579> they<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.880> get<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> inside<00:03:10.599> of<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
cuz they can get to the inside of the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.860 
cuz they can get to the inside of the
bone<00:03:11.019> easy<00:03:13.500> awesome<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:15.099> these<00:03:15.280> treats

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.210 
bone easy awesome I like these treats
perhaps<00:03:16.870> we'll<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.470> buy<00:03:17.620> some<00:03:17.890> more<00:03:17.920> if

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
perhaps we'll have to buy some more if

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.280 
perhaps we'll have to buy some more if
they<00:03:18.400> get<00:03:18.579> through<00:03:18.790> these<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.329> these<00:03:19.930> tend<00:03:20.230> to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
they get through these but these tend to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.420 
they get through these but these tend to
last<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.680> really<00:03:20.920> long<00:03:21.069> time<00:03:23.250> their<00:03:24.250> last

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
