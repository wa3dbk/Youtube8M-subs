00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.400

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.859
 There was this game you ask, but the point is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.860
 the volume that I wrote very, very much 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.969
 posts about the tag historian him after which 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.969

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.850
 I want to see many well, as naomi 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.070
 English after completing work on 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.730
 the game they sent it to me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.520
 wrote more fun fact and they did 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.820
 her only two days she turned out better 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 before 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.320
 yes so guys it was like i got a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 now we basically go to the story 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.840
 this clans eggman finds my gave Sonic 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.840
 which is destroyed and exclaims 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.260
 in the meantime, our heroes are flying 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.010
 mobius or earth rescue capsules 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.590
 to whom it is convenient and here they fall into 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.680
 pixel reefer so it doesn't 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.420
 which turns now go and here 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.210
 all without meeting my friends who 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.130
 also baked and that's who's bad and they are 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.890
 There help on can catch egggman 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.460
 the middle here is such as full heat 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.980
 and my big and tail by the way emeralds of chaos 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.110
 we have the very beginning of the end of the game in us 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.620
 waiting for the last battle with the doctor 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.420
 egggman and everything comes again 3d format 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.729
 Gent is now a gameplay 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.720
 Sonic gameplay is repeated as in 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.369
 past episodes 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.100
 however now we can crawl the gameplay 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.170
 for thails absolutely the same as sonic 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.830
 Yozhig 4 episode main warm them when you 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.680
 they played it 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.540
 however now you have to beat sonic 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.810
 and eat hot dog instead 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 and my gameplay tells us that we should 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.720
 overtake the trail for and then catch up 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.650
 Sonic and the gameplay of running is a shooter from 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.200
 first person 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.100
 we have to shoot a hot dog for what 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 he is with a horn 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.580
 and the gameplay for the heat for that rule on 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.570
 jogging sight because he saw I was about 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.720
 shark incidentally in the game as many as five 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.540
 stories and if we open them all then we 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.440
 open the last story as a frame if 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.019
 we will turn on 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.730
 we get the most epic world titles 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.910
 as in past episodes in the game there 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.550
 five levels way to stations 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.190
 road from stations who is road over 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.470
 station square and the road under the station sky 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.600
 since the emeralds of chaos we have ourselves 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 start then in this game finally 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.120
 come back super emeralds yes guys 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.440
 You can rejoice, however, to poke them 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 we must get to the special level 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.970
 for this u must for this we must 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.830
 collect 50 rings and shout out bananas and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.080
 then we will go special level 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.120
 which is very original in this game 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.350
 they are a game who wants 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.110
 become a millionaire 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.020
 if you spent answer questions there 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.000
 the same 10 stuff you get shu + root 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.730
 and if you then decide to continue the game 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.450
 and neutral answer you lose everything 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.580
 I take away the surprise of the mur house and well, I'm glad 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.160

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.600
