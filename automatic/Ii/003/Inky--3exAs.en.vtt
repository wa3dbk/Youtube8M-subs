I<00:01:09.180> love<00:01:09.540> hoop<00:01:09.900> earrings<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> especially

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
I love hoop earrings and I especially

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
I love hoop earrings and I especially
love<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> piece

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
love them when they kind of have a piece

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
love them when they kind of have a piece
for<00:01:13.350> their<00:01:13.500> lobe<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.100> dangle

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
for their lobe and then they dangle

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.649 
for their lobe and then they dangle
because<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> makes<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> easier<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> wear

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
because then it makes it easier to wear

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.380 
because then it makes it easier to wear
with<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> scarf<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.520> these<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.330> are

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
be nosy because I like one of these is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.899 
be nosy because I like one of these is
because<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.100> always<00:01:26.250> throw<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> undo<00:01:26.790> the

mess at the back and stick in a larger

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
mess at the back and stick in a larger
hoop<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.820> larger<00:01:30.450> hoops<00:01:30.630> which

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
hoop if you have larger hoops which

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
hoop if you have larger hoops which
