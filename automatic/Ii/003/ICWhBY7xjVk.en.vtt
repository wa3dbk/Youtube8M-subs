00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of a problem sometimes it's a little bit

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.940 
of a problem sometimes it's a little bit
hard<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> push<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.770> kind

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
hard to push it this way and it's kind

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
hard to push it this way and it's kind
of<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.250> side<00:01:38.490> against<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> volume

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
kind of loose you can access them really

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
kind of loose you can access them really
easy<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> front<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.750> have

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the home button it again it's covered in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.490 
the home button it again it's covered in
the<00:01:51.090> silicon<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> has<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> D<00:01:52.259> like

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the silicon it kind of has the D like

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
the silicon it kind of has the D like
the<00:01:52.619> Exim<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.030> easy<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> press

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the Exim and it's very easy to press

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.639 
the Exim and it's very easy to press
this<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> click<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.259> pretty<00:01:55.470> cool

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
this kind of click it's pretty cool

this kind of click it's pretty cool
really<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.729> top<00:01:56.880> button<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:58.290> here's<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
really like top button but here's the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100 
really like top button but here's the
front<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.399> front<00:01:59.759> again<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.689> very<00:02:00.899> happy

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
front so the front again not very happy

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889 
front so the front again not very happy
about<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.469> front<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.729> silicone<00:02:03.119> case<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> not

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
about the front the silicone case is not

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
about the front the silicone case is not
bad<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.409> doesn't<00:02:04.740> attract<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.490> lint<00:02:05.939> as

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
bad it doesn't attract as much lint as

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.809 
bad it doesn't attract as much lint as
or<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.409> dust<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> things<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.220> some

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
or like dust and things like that some

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490 
or like dust and things like that some
others<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.300> look<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.539> cases<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:09.989> there<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
others to look on cases out there it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
others to look on cases out there it
does<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.979> bit<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.000> much<00:02:12.120> as

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
does a little bit but not as much as

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.790 
does a little bit but not as much as
some<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
some of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.230 
some of
cases<00:02:13.160> out<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.610> what<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:13.880> not<00:02:14.000> happy

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
cases out there but what I'm not happy

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.330 
cases out there but what I'm not happy
about<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.900> how<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.440> case<00:02:15.710> fits<00:02:16.070> it's<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
about is the how the case fits it's a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.140 
about is the how the case fits it's a
little<00:02:16.550> bit<00:02:16.640> sloppy<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.930> see<00:02:18.320> right

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
little bit sloppy as you can see right

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.340 
little bit sloppy as you can see right
there<00:02:20.150> may<00:02:20.450> be<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:22.310> especially<00:02:23.350> right

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
there may be right here especially right

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.520 
there may be right here especially right
there<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.820> can<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.270> very<00:02:26.870> kind<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.320> easy

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
there you can see it's very kind of easy

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.180 
there you can see it's very kind of easy
to<00:02:27.950> push<00:02:28.850> off<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.510> very<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.620> loose<00:02:30.890> it's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
to push off it's very like loose it's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430 
to push off it's very like loose it's
not<00:02:31.370> very<00:02:31.520> doesn't<00:02:32.360> stick<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:33.080> ipad

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
not very doesn't stick on to the ipad

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.470 
not very doesn't stick on to the ipad
perfectly<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.220> keeps<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.820> nice<00:02:35.090> clean

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
perfectly and keeps it like a nice clean

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750 
perfectly and keeps it like a nice clean
look<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:36.350> kind<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.650> messy<00:02:37.100> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.430> pull<00:02:37.640> it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
look it's kind of messy if you pull it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.250 
look it's kind of messy if you pull it
back<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.360> might<00:02:38.630> get<00:02:38.810> stuff<00:02:39.050> like

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
back like this and might get stuff like

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.610 
back like this and might get stuff like
that<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.620> also<00:02:40.070> doesn't<00:02:40.520> stick<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> ipad

right<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.770> sheepie<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.160> their<00:02:43.280> spacing<00:02:43.820> all

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
right there sheepie to their spacing all

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.240 
right there sheepie to their spacing all
the<00:02:44.360> way<00:02:44.480> around<00:02:44.600> oh<00:02:44.990> there's<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.710> lot<00:02:45.830> spacing

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the way around oh there's a lot spacing

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.220 
the way around oh there's a lot spacing
on<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> bottom<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.240> all<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.810> sides<00:02:48.080> and

on the bottom but all the sides and
stuff<00:02:48.500> there's<00:02:48.710> always<00:02:49.130> facing<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:49.730> ducks<00:02:49.970> can

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
stuff there's always facing so ducks can

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
not a bad price for like a throw on case

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.190 
not a bad price for like a throw on case
but<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:01.640> probably<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.330> probably<00:03:02.570> wouldn't

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
but it's probably I probably wouldn't

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.440 
but it's probably I probably wouldn't
buy<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.350> in<00:03:04.130> my<00:03:04.280> opinion<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.300> don't

buy it in my opinion just it I don't

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.730 
buy it in my opinion just it I don't
know<00:03:05.480> I'm<00:03:05.630> kind<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.840> disappointed<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:06.500> case
