00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
because it felt a little plasticky a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.819 
because it felt a little plasticky a
little<00:00:58.239> kind<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.289> I<00:00:59.379> guess<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.649> wasn't

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
little kind of I just I guess I wasn't

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.950 
little kind of I just I guess I wasn't
expecting<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:00.609> was<00:01:00.699> expecting<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.269> be<00:01:01.389> metal

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
expecting I guess you said maybe thought

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.020 
expecting I guess you said maybe thought
that<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.160> feel<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.670> knife<00:04:02.850> like

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
that you just feel like a knife like

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.130 
that you just feel like a knife like
that<00:04:03.239> would<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.450> some<00:04:03.600> weight<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:03.959> but

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
that would have some weight to it but

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.050 
that would have some weight to it but
when<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> open<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.950> use<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.430> mechanism
