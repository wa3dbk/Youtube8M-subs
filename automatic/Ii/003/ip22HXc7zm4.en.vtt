00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 ay if cyrus walks already of the 40 presented 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.540
 by javi rodríguez for maria de dos 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.559
 sides 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 because it's time for the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.460
 nominations with pepe mejide hello to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 everyone 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 good comes the marianas the more he goes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.230
 disrespecting the audience and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.230
 his companions in order them 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:48.600
 and well let's go there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.190
 first of all today I want to nominate the one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.690
 had the brilliant idea of putting a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 window on the radio at the height of the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.739
 urinals I do not say it because this morning 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.000
 has gone to pee and the hotel's 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 in front of me they have seen me the talk of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.620
 top down orange with which first 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 nominate those who put that window and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 and second to nominate the classmates who 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.869
 I do not know why they leave that open every day 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.430
 window with which then the vision of the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.040
 application is easy a window in a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.860
 bathroom 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.330
 to fall to gratinar already but to the height 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.510
 of the urinals because you have some 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.430
 hotel windows directly opposite 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.340
 is elevated to look 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.340
 and today I wanted to talk to raul but come 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.820
 and the road 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.820
 a little taken but good and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.930
 raul the curls because even you think 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.659
 what I say is worth the name but in 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.499
 change in the appointment and call raul or 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.719
 it's a good story raul truth yes it was 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.569
 raul today I wanted to talk to you about your 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.659
 section what you missed partying 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.579
 because I do not understand it if it's a section 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.469
 that theoretically compiles the songs 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.140
 that sounded like a party in a specific year 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:00.079
 the problem is that you are never faithful to the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.310
 initial idea of the section because now 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.859
 what you are doing is putting songs 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.599
 What the listeners are proposing to you 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.360
 this has become a section 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.019
 shabby and municipal was of petitions 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.019
 musicals 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.909
 in this section that promised to be of the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.670
 most fun of the program has been 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.909
 become a paripé where people 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.099
 ask for songs and you wear them 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.780
 people should ask you successes of that year 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.599
 Do not propose to you so that you 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.639
 put what happens is that it is much more 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.950
 easy to put what they ask you to lose 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.920
 the time to find your truth 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.500
 Well, very bad 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.760
 you have something to say yes indeed there 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
 many requests that I can not put 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.080
 because they are songs that are very 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.130
 ok but they are not so so so so 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.130
 known from that year 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.910
 and many of them that are from year 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.110
 in particular many requests that are 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.870
 'avatar' year after year and I can not do 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.160
 so many it is impossible to accommodate so many 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.550
 there are many requests that remain 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.320
 outside in this section you should put the 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.680
 music of the hits that were danced in 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.650
 a specific year under your criteria, not under 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.319
 musical requests 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.260
 you are able to understand it to a fifty 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.200
 fifty good then leave a fifty and do what 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.209
 normal 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.930
 with which as things do not go well 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.909
 I'm going to friend Raúl, you're nominated 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.640
 let's go now with the program note of 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.700
 today 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.190
 for turning this study into a room 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.670
 waiting for the doctor 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.110
 with 27 then per minute 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.040
 I say it because the one who is sick that 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.040
 stay at home please 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.590
 for having a sunken guy on the phone 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.740
 because his girlfriend just left him in 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.790
 antenna 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.560
 and you put champagne effects 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.490
 music and cheer him up to this end 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.090
 of year comes dj nano to the riviera 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.090
 or what 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.829
 and you know Rodriguez for eating the 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.829
 pimple of the micro at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.890
 andy jury has decided that the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.890
 today's fame note be 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.870
 13 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.000
 I could not prove it as a Christmas gift 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.449
 not one of these days 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.880
 it depends on you does not value that we are here 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.520
 several people with a gripazo that no 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.960
 You see doing program and fighting for 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.960
 that this comes out of the judgment of the case 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.570
 go 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 if I stay at home deprives me of pleasure 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.289
 of infecting Maria lama deprives me of 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.669
 pleasure of seeing sick raul that deprives 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.669
 pleasure of seeing ill cristóbal 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.030
 in the morning at 6 we go back 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.030
 those of us who are alive
