you<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.710> fish<00:00:25.920> uses<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.800> like

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you how my fish uses it so first I like

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
you how my fish uses it so first I like
to<00:00:29.250> take<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.730> top<00:00:30.060> part<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.890> because<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to take this top part off because it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.970 
to take this top part off because it
makes<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.369> easier<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.090> find<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.719> corner<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
makes it easier to find a corner that I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.869 
makes it easier to find a corner that I
just<00:00:35.340> put<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:36.620> now<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> slowly

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
just put it in now I'm going to slowly

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.270 
just put it in now I'm going to slowly
put<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.649> exercise<00:00:41.129> mirror<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:43.170> corner

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.979 

now<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.610> fish<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.910> probably<00:00:48.270> go<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
now your fish will probably go up to it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.920 
now your fish will probably go up to it
and<00:00:50.690> stand<00:00:51.690> start<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> flare<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> its

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
betta fish just starts to go all around

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
betta fish just starts to go all around
the<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:15.479> tank<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> only<00:01:17.939> leave

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the the tank and so that so I only leave

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.649 
the the tank and so that so I only leave
it<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.200> few<00:01:19.640> minutes<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.570> only

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it in for a few minutes but you're only

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
it in for a few minutes but you're only
supposed<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> leave<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> five

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
supposed to leave it in for up to five

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
supposed to leave it in for up to five
minutes<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.900> because<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> don't<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
minutes so and because you don't want to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.359 
minutes so and because you don't want to
just<00:01:25.890> leave<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.820> tank<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.369> long

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just leave it in your tank for a long

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
just leave it in your tank for a long
time<00:01:31.340> now<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
time now I think I'm going to take it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.950 
time now I think I'm going to take it
out<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.799> only<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:36.329> wasn't<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
out now I only I probably wasn't even a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
out now I only I probably wasn't even a
minute<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.329> only<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.799> may<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.369> your

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
minute but this is only it may take your

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.210 
minute but this is only it may take your
bit<00:01:41.759> betta<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.210> few<00:01:42.420> times<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.799> used<00:01:44.009> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bit betta a few times to get used to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
bit betta a few times to get used to
using<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> probably<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.710> only

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
using it like this is probably this only

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
using it like this is probably this only
the<00:01:47.399> third<00:01:48.000> time<00:01:48.329> I've<00:01:48.540> used<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.180> now<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the third time I've used it so now you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
the third time I've used it so now you
slowly<00:01:51.720> take<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
slowly take it out I'm going to put it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.140 
slowly take it out I'm going to put it
in<00:01:57.079> paper<00:01:58.079> towel<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> dry<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.979> off

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
in paper towel to dry it off

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.380 
in paper towel to dry it off
and<00:02:00.480> so<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.090> try<00:02:03.330> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and so that's all that you do to try to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.250 
and so that's all that you do to try to
use<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.670> first<00:02:05.940> time<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.570> used<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
use it now the first time that I used it

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.870 
use it now the first time that I used it
I<00:02:07.729> didn't<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:13.220> betta<00:02:14.220> fish<00:02:14.310> when

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
I didn't know that the betta fish when

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.920 
I didn't know that the betta fish when
they<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.980> fight

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
they are going to fight

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.290 
they are going to fight
they<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.710> know<00:02:19.740> they<00:02:19.860> flare<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
they you know they flare like that and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.660 
they you know they flare like that and
so<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.990> had<00:02:22.380> no<00:02:22.500> idea<00:02:22.620> what's<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
so I had no idea what's going on and I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.790 
so I had no idea what's going on and I
took<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:24.450> away<00:02:24.480> because<00:02:25.320> if<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
took it out right away because if it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.160 
took it out right away because if it
made<00:02:26.550> me<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:27.060> nervous<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> thought<00:02:27.750> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
made me really nervous and I thought I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.500 
made me really nervous and I thought I
almost<00:02:28.530> killed<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.040> fish<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:29.930> um<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:32.510> but

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
almost killed my fish but um and but

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.420 
almost killed my fish but um and but
that<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.350> natural<00:02:34.500> behavior<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.370> do

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that but it's a natural behavior they do

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.780 
that but it's a natural behavior they do
that<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.030> make<00:02:36.060> themselves<00:02:36.540> look<00:02:37.020> bigger<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
that to make themselves look bigger to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.240 
that to make themselves look bigger to
the<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.450> know<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.930> enemy<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.560> protect
