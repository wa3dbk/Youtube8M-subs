as well as some high grossing now there

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
as well as some high grossing now there
is<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.260> upfront<00:00:52.770> cost<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.000> but

like<00:01:21.060> growing<00:01:21.360> radishes<00:01:21.869> outdoors<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.070> want

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
like growing radishes outdoors you want

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
like growing radishes outdoors you want
to<00:01:23.340> keep<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.000> soil<00:01:24.479> moist<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.680> stopping

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
to keep the soil moist but not stopping

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
to keep the soil moist but not stopping
wet<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:27.390> radishes<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.500> dry<00:01:28.740> out

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
wet because radishes when they dry out

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.010 
wet because radishes when they dry out
if<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> bulb<00:01:29.850> already<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.479> they

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
if they have a bulb already on them they

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.219 
if they have a bulb already on them they
will<00:01:31.229> produce<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:31.920> hot<00:01:32.460> tense<00:01:33.119> taste<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
will produce a very hot tense taste to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.640 
will produce a very hot tense taste to
their<00:01:34.380> bulb<00:01:34.650> greens<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.640> also<00:01:35.670> edible<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.750> if

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
their bulb greens are also edible and if

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
their bulb greens are also edible and if
you<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.400> keep<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.939> moist<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.689> have

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you do not keep them moist like we have

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
you do not keep them moist like we have
with<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.470> particular<00:01:41.040> radish<00:01:41.460> it'll<00:01:42.090> begin

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
with this particular radish it'll begin

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
with this particular radish it'll begin
to<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> sea<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.740> outside

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to go to sea just like it would outside

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.460 
to go to sea just like it would outside
so<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> great<00:01:45.540> application<00:01:46.290> whether

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
so this is a great application whether

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590 
so this is a great application whether
you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:47.009> ground<00:01:47.369> outside<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.360> live<00:01:48.509> in
