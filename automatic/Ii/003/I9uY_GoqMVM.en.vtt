00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.859
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 I came today to talk to you about 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 have lunch in Coimbra on my 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 experience as a student in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 from the master's degree to the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.810
 doctoral degree in 2007 I started to think 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.730
 about my master's degree at 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.329
 coimbra and more or less the first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 half of the year I joined several 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.590
 various university websites 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 to search for possible 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 masters in the area of ​​communication 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.570
 possible is courses that I could do 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.890
 since the strict sense sense act then I 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.539
 I thought if I wanted to make a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.250
 specialization I wanted to get even 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.440
 that the masters invest in the area 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 academic and I ended up opting for the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.649
 I have found at the University of Coimbra 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.640
 very interesting to research the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 teachers 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 I found a teacher who more or 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 less areas of studies seemed 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.110
 interesting that I could declare the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.129
 my project that was developing the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 project in the history of the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.119
 journalism but I ended up losing 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 project because it really was not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 takes what is required was the rich and lu 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.590
 the grade of the note of the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 graduation is from the average that they 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 make the selection of students by gathering 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.200
 students who apply for the course and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.270
 they note more or less the notes they 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 they felt the cut note we do not know 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 how it is to be a cutting note 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.490
 had approved that list of excluded 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.960
 it was fixed after not seeing will be this today 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.509
 is all this is done through a 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.720
 online platform in which the student 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.710
 name you sign up if you make your 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 registration through this platform and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.979
 Are you going to travel how are they going? 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.060
 require besides the vaccination card 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.030
 w account is required 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.030
 tained by the tetanus vaccine. 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.530
 required the degree of your degree 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.960
 curriculum because they will see if 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.460
 you also have a resume is appropriate 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 to that market 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.260
 some magistrates will require the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.959
 more personal interview 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.000
 so I do not know how it goes 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.019
 because in my case it was only necessary to send 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.450
 these documents 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.910
 there are only three important dates that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.769
 phases for you to sign up or 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.230
 the index is further inscribed in the year but 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.019
 middle of the year June and July you want 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.600
 in the last phase is more or less August and 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.519
 September and the last call if the course 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.080
 still available 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.640
 then usually in the faculty of 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.319
 economy that it was located 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.330
 master's degree and social sciences 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.650
 these these vacancies only run out in 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.360
 first and second phase 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.620
 unlike the faculty of letters of the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.410
 university of coimbra that sometimes 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.819
 have a much greater supply of vacancies 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.560
 because there is little demand mainly 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.780
 use in places 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.030
 so the brazilian account is an offer 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.440
 very large number of places while the number 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.510
 7 public in Brazil 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.030
 the lack of vacancies as it is necessary 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.500
 select a much narrower shape 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.750
 through the project and I think it's very 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.329
 well because sometimes the year starts at 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.910
 stadium of coimbra and suddenly the course 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.370
 It's not half what I wanted because he did not 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.739
 he did not inform himself or even the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.359
 teachers do not have to do very well with 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.190
 the ace but this can also happen 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.250
 In Brazil, if you can suddenly make a 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.350
 Wonderful project and suddenly you 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.989
 enter university would you approve the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.269
 process to complicate and suddenly not 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.650
 It is course that you chose that can 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.600
 happened outside 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.590
 frustrations are part of the universe 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.410
 academic 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 I think this is what can happen with 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.920
 anyone 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.130
 You suddenly look up to have a 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.500
 scholarship and comes into existence 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.570
 it's not quite what you imagined my 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.850
 The part that I said about the PhD is very 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.080
 similar to masters already I was here 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.820
 I have a bag 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.810
 the first year was more or less 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.240
 similar to the master's degree but is a 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.150
 Joy to those who like this 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.760
 I hope you like it that way. 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.650
 video if you have questions about 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.990
 Please wrote here in the comments 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 sending via Facebook that forms 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.150
 a possibility for you is 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.350
 important 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.420
 some people who have a course 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.400
 very long professional can do 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.140
 masters in adopting and some 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.420
 people who have the same long course 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.290
 in the city can do the doctorate and 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.840
 masters 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.100
 so this is something I did not do 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.450
 much confusion in the head that people 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.100
 how can a person do in the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.280
 Road how are you going to do? 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.060
 doctorate and master's degree at times 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.790
 the student who has a very long course 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.070
 for example the journalist and try is this 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.980
 allows you to choose the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.320
 professional allows it to pass 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.440
 directly from the fear of jumping a 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.040
 masters and PhD but sometimes 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.160
 methodologically the student is discussed 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.420
 a bit with these more 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.850
 academics as I go to date at the 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.010
 chapter methodologies how do I do 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.800
 part of what will be the difference between 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.200
 theory and practice and a number of issues 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.580
 that then the student who has himself 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.530
 this very large course in the area 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.540
 at the gym end up 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.610
 slipping these things he was 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.930
 It was a great learning experience for me think 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.510
 that it would not be able to do 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.790
 a thesis as a quality if it had not 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.520
 made the first dissertation started 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.320
 So this is what I have for you guys. 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.030
