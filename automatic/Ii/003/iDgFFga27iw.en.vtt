 hypopressive abdominal training course 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.030
 training for physiotherapists and then 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 as it comes very well in the postpartum 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.420

 the exercises and graveras that is a 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.960
 enjoyed if you notice a lot how is how 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.070
 the figure is used a lot and it recovers 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.990
 the abdominal tone that after 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.790
 pregnancy is important that here you 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.980
 the joy of the children fell a little 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.450
 writing to all new bodies in 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.700
 order then let's explain one thing very 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.430
 important the difference between these 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.080
 hypopressive abdominal and abdominal 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.940
 classics and that you kill yourself that sleeves 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.310
 I'm going to tell you how to lose two 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.810
 sizes was between a little while we took note 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.210
 by Martha then you have to 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.280
 follow more tricks so far 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.410
 we have left marta the look and the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.510
 gym working the abs which 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.550
 true hollywood celebrity are we going to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.840
 see how is a martha you have the tablet 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.840
 of chocolate the tummy or not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.659
 I all my life 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.629
 this is back kills I'll explain to you if 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.219
 now a very new thing 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.040
 these are the abs that have 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:28.250
 taught all my life 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.689
 or worse the traditional abdominals are 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.840
 has proven that their types of 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.970
 abdominals increase the pressure inside 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.300
 of the abdomen in the pelvic floor 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.420
 and all this can be harmful because 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.050
 the hormone bindings that also 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.990
 they are very tiring and now I teach you that 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.620
 I'll show you the abs and 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:57.030
 progressive attention 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.330
 get up and put on hypopressive abdominal 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.590
 all at once in these abs 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.620
 everything has to be said that those abs 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.050
 have been created by the doctor 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.050
 marcel caufriez doctor in physiotherapy 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.520
 so that he is fed up with doing the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.650
 classics or smells like having fun because 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.580
 oppressive and progressive because to 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.450
 difference of the abdominals 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.180
 traditional this happens 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.910
 when I put myself in a position that 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.220
 I'll tell you if they fall in a 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.190
 immediate pressure to level 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.620
 abdominal if thanks to a relaxation 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.940
 tonic of the diaphragm that is to grains 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:42.050
 let's go there take air loose air 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.400
 and now I ask you to open ribs 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.920
 tonic relaxation frees plot and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.290
 reflex activation of the fiber of the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.770
 abdominal girdle on the pelvic floor stop 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.720
 catch air 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.580
 it costs you can say at the beginning it's 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.080
 important to the second one is the winner of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.620
 rivals not marÃ­a let's do the second 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.790
 time 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.790
 catch the air 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.389
 release the air 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:11.279
 and now I ask you to open ribs 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.689
 this what happens the reflex activation 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.779
 involuntary I'm not asking you 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.699
 no way to put gut 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:22.550
 this happens thanks to the opening of the 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.550
 ribs here we have a kind of pressure 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.640
 two friends in how much time can be 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.530
 lose two sizes that you have to practice 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.820
 for how long if I did not 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.770
 well I'm going to put all the afternoon 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.080
 it was clear is proven of the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.840
 studies done by ko free that 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.030
 can reduce the perimeter by up to 8% 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.460
 waist 8% corresponds almost 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.350
 two sizes of trousers of course this is not 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.640
 walk it and tomorrow you have to practice it 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.680
 over a few months 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.780
 perfect we mark another exercise because 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.180
 since in summer in the new one to put 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.630
 be elaborated placed this for a 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:04.170
 little knee follows parallel hands 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.630
 arms at shoulder height grow 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.520
 well as it is a postural gymnastics 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.310
 let's take care of the posture you take 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.320
 air 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:18.270
 release the air 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:21.180
 and now open rib come 12 has 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.980
 5 Very good pint while sea is fine 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.530
 Tuesday and that continues open and in the 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.830
 ribs this relaxes in clear if well 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.770
 in the defense there is that there 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.330
 wait to do a few sessions 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.270
 then all this gymnastics can be 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.130
 integrate and learn more simply 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.660

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.470
 little bit that I'm going to mess around the class 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:49.500
