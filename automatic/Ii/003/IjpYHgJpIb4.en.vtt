00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
and it is improving I guess I am

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.700 
and it is improving I guess I am
improving<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.330> will<00:03:10.660> take<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.960> while<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.560> I

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
improving but it will take a while but I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.460 
improving but it will take a while but I
have<00:03:11.920> two<00:03:12.130> weeks<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.000> fine<00:03:13.330> but<00:03:14.200> we

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
have two weeks so that is fine but we

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.520 
have two weeks so that is fine but we
will<00:03:14.710> have<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.310> used<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.020> I'm<00:03:17.020> sure

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
will have to get used to it I'm sure

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.820 
will have to get used to it I'm sure
that<00:03:18.070> once<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.640> do<00:03:18.880> master<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.900> tactical

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
that once we do master the tactical

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.860 
that once we do master the tactical
defending<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.400> will<00:03:21.490> become<00:03:21.850> better<00:03:22.540> much

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
defending it will become better much

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.190 
defending it will become better much
better

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
better

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.850 
better
but<00:03:23.800> then<00:03:23.980> again<00:03:25.230> putting<00:03:26.230> pressure<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.620> your

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
but then again putting pressure on your

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.970 
but then again putting pressure on your
opponent<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.600> seems<00:03:28.600> non-existent<00:03:29.590> anymore

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.560 
fuck they need to really put this in
tactical<00:04:17.650> goalkeeping<00:04:18.340> because<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:19.000> don't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
tactical goalkeeping because I don't

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.180 
tactical goalkeeping because I don't
even<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.930> what<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> goalkeepers<00:04:20.830> do<00:04:20.979> most

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
even know what the goalkeepers do most

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.240 
even know what the goalkeepers do most
of<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.340> time<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:22.030> new

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
of the time the new

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.189 
of the time the new
the<00:04:24.250> people<00:04:25.000> attacking<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.660> everything<00:04:26.020> is

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
the people attacking and everything is

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.920 
the people attacking and everything is
it's<00:04:26.979> really<00:04:27.160> hard<00:04:27.250> for<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.639> goalkeepers<00:04:28.180> to

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
it's really hard for the goalkeepers to

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.770 
it's really hard for the goalkeepers to
save<00:04:29.590> anything<00:04:29.979> really<00:04:30.310> because<00:04:30.699> chip<00:04:31.509> shots

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
save anything really because chip shots

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.689 
save anything really because chip shots
are<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.320> overpowered<00:04:32.889> in<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.190> demo<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.490> don't

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
are so overpowered in the demo I don't

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.730 
are so overpowered in the demo I don't
even<00:04:33.910> know<00:04:34.120> why<00:04:34.389> it's<00:04:35.080> like<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.440> goalkeeper

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
even know why it's like the goalkeeper

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.590 
even know why it's like the goalkeeper
just<00:04:36.039> stands<00:04:36.280> there<00:04:36.400> watching<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.389> ball

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
just stands there watching the ball

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.629 
just stands there watching the ball
going<00:04:38.130> little<00:04:39.130> shots<00:04:40.110> ground<00:04:41.110> shots<00:04:41.639> the

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
going little shots ground shots the

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.060 
going little shots ground shots the
goalkeepers<00:04:43.150> are<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.539> they<00:04:44.470> don't<00:04:44.650> even<00:04:44.770> react

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
goalkeepers are so they don't even react

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.320 
goalkeepers are so they don't even react
to<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.610> don't<00:04:45.669> even<00:04:45.850> know<00:04:46.120> why<00:04:46.410> love<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:48.330> cpu

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
to it I don't even know why love the cpu

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.510 
to it I don't even know why love the cpu
was<00:04:49.539> scoring<00:04:49.930> against<00:04:50.320> me<00:04:50.470> just<00:04:50.680> by<00:04:51.220> low

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
was scoring against me just by low

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.150 
was scoring against me just by low
ground<00:04:51.820> shots<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.720> keeper<00:04:52.990> could<00:04:53.259> just<00:04:53.560> stand

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
ground shots the keeper could just stand

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.939 
ground shots the keeper could just stand
and<00:04:54.610> hold<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.570> but<00:04:55.599> he<00:04:55.990> just<00:04:56.199> stands<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.919> looks

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
and hold it but he just stands and looks

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.170 
and hold it but he just stands and looks
I<00:04:57.220> move<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.669> even<00:04:57.880> saving<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.840> another<00:04:59.530> thing<00:04:59.740> is

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
I move I even saving it another thing is

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.830 
I move I even saving it another thing is
I'm<00:05:01.180> gonna<00:05:01.330> talk<00:05:01.509> about<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.880> stupid<00:05:03.880> very

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
I'm gonna talk about is the stupid very

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.740 
I'm gonna talk about is the stupid very
stupid<00:05:07.530> attacking<00:05:08.530> basically<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:10.120> lot<00:05:10.720> of

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
stupid attacking basically a lot of

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.510 
stupid attacking basically a lot of
shots<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.349> you're<00:05:11.680> gonna<00:05:11.830> be<00:05:12.039> doing<00:05:12.370> is

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
shots that you're gonna be doing is

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.700 
shots that you're gonna be doing is
ground<00:05:12.820> shot<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.360> don't<00:05:13.690> even<00:05:13.750> know<00:05:14.050> why<00:05:14.289> like

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
ground shot I don't even know why like

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.159 
ground shot I don't even know why like
power<00:05:15.130> shots<00:05:15.520> are<00:05:16.060> non-existent<00:05:16.449> in<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.900> game

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
power shots are non-existent in the game

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.100 
power shots are non-existent in the game
unless<00:05:17.830> you're<00:05:18.039> certain<00:05:18.400> attacker<00:05:18.840> but<00:05:19.840> that

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
unless you're certain attacker but that

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.800 
unless you're certain attacker but that
seems<00:05:20.710> more<00:05:21.070> realistic<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.669> me<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.300> maybe<00:05:22.539> we

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
seems more realistic to me so maybe we

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.510 
seems more realistic to me so maybe we
have<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.139> get<00:05:23.289> used<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.590> who<00:05:23.830> knows<00:05:24.099> how<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.340> do

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
have to get used to who knows how to do

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.500 
have to get used to who knows how to do
and<00:05:24.699> who<00:05:24.910> doesn't<00:05:26.190> but<00:05:27.190> yeah<00:05:27.610> that's<00:05:27.880> pretty

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
and who doesn't but yeah that's pretty

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.360 
and who doesn't but yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:28.630> most<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.530> things<00:05:29.830> that<00:05:29.979> I<00:05:30.010> wanted<00:05:30.310> to

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
much most of the things that I wanted to

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.570 
much most of the things that I wanted to
talk<00:05:30.610> about<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:31.780> impact<00:05:32.229> engine<00:05:32.740> seems<00:05:32.979> very

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
talk about the impact engine seems very

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.450 
talk about the impact engine seems very
buggy<00:05:34.150> at<00:05:34.389> this<00:05:34.570> point<00:05:34.900> are<00:05:35.110> even<00:05:35.409> know<00:05:35.620> if

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
buggy at this point are even know if

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.730 
buggy at this point are even know if
this<00:05:36.760> is<00:05:36.820> fixed<00:05:37.510> because<00:05:37.659> this<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.320> very<00:05:38.560> old

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
this is fixed because this is a very old

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.430 
this is fixed because this is a very old
version<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.430> demo<00:05:39.820> as<00:05:40.030> before<00:05:40.840> Gamescom

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
version of the demo as before Gamescom

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.149 
version of the demo as before Gamescom
I'm<00:05:41.620> pretty<00:05:41.919> sure<00:05:42.070> of<00:05:42.220> that<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:44.650> it's<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.889> very

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
I'm pretty sure of that but it's a very

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.060 
I'm pretty sure of that but it's a very
old<00:05:45.449> build<00:05:46.449> of<00:05:46.599> the<00:05:46.720> demo<00:05:46.990> days<00:05:47.169> many<00:05:47.470> you<00:05:47.919> can

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
old build of the demo days many you can

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.790 
old build of the demo days many you can
see<00:05:48.220> such<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:49.270> impact<00:05:49.570> engine<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.320> many<00:05:50.500> bugs

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
see such the impact engine so many bugs

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.710 
see such the impact engine so many bugs
on<00:05:51.099> YouTube<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.550> could<00:05:51.699> search<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.360> videos
