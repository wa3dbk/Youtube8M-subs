of this suit that I am wearing I just

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.660 
of this suit that I am wearing I just
got<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.879> pool<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:40.860> kind<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
got back from the pool and I kind of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
got back from the pool and I kind of
before<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.180> went<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> pool<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.690> filmed<00:00:43.320> like

before I went to the pool I filmed like

basically I think they go from like a
size<00:01:04.019> 8<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.549> 30<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.689> believe<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.950> they

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
size 8 to like a 30 I believe so they

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
size 8 to like a 30 I believe so they
have<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> wide<00:01:08.820> variety<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.920> swim<00:01:10.920> swimsuits<00:01:11.760> in
