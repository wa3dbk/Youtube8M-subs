device so over the past 21 hours you can
see<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.540> been<00:01:21.810> charging<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
see it's been charging it in but the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
long time the GPS has have been on a lot

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
long time the GPS has have been on a lot

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
but you can see that the network has

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.330 
but you can see that the network has
been<00:01:32.810> trying<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> discover<00:01:34.710> quite<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.100> lot

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
been trying to discover quite a lot

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
been trying to discover quite a lot
during<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.640> period<00:01:36.230> which<00:01:37.230> also<00:01:37.440> drains

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
during that period which also drains

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
during that period which also drains
battery<00:01:38.130> life<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.760> know<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.830> we

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
battery life as we know and if we

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.890 
battery life as we know and if we
compare<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> XXL<00:01:42.210> Izzy

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
compare that to XXL Izzy

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320 
compare that to XXL Izzy
you'll<00:01:43.620> noticed<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.400> young<00:01:44.490> sure<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.210> would

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
actually right now if we go back to

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.030 
actually right now if we go back to
automatron<00:01:59.880> itself<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
automatron itself we can see that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.420 
automatron itself we can see that
everything<00:02:02.460> works<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.990> did<00:02:04.170> before<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.340> we

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
everything works as it did before so we

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.240 
everything works as it did before so we
have<00:02:05.610> Super<00:02:05.940> User<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.480> east<00:02:06.690> note<00:02:07.250> we

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
