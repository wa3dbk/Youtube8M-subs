like<00:02:40.790> Earl's<00:02:41.790> punches<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:44.880> circle

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
like Earl's punches and a circle

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.530 
like Earl's punches and a circle
formation<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.320> punches<00:02:46.680> through<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.540> okay

formation like punches through them okay

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.720 
formation like punches through them okay
how<00:02:48.720> would<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
how would I do this so I just go and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.290 
how would I do this so I just go and
think<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.910> when<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.120> put<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.450> together<00:02:59.300> I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
think it when they put it together I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.140 
think it when they put it together I
really<00:03:01.290> enjoy<00:03:01.560> getting<00:03:01.800> into<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.430> throw<00:03:03.000> those

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
do you feel like it's you have to be

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.309 
do you feel like it's you have to be
more<00:04:08.280> uninhibited<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.180> do<00:04:09.269> voiceover<00:04:09.840> work<00:04:09.870> or

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
more uninhibited to do voiceover work or

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.819 
more uninhibited to do voiceover work or
to<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:10.650> optional<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.760> think<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:13.200> think<00:04:13.620> it's

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
to do optional I think it's I think it's

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.279 
to do optional I think it's I think it's
equal<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.359> know<00:04:15.389> that's<00:04:15.900> that's

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
equal but the you know that's that's

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.140 
equal but the you know that's that's
very<00:04:16.799> interesting<00:04:17.160> because<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.579> comes<00:04:17.789> out<00:04:17.970> in

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
very interesting because it comes out in

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.770 
very interesting because it comes out in
two<00:04:18.419> completely<00:04:18.720> different<00:04:19.019> ways<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.799> think

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
two completely different ways I think

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.029 
two completely different ways I think
definitely<00:04:21.780> voiceover<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.770> have<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.979> be

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
definitely voiceover you have to be

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.400 
definitely voiceover you have to be
completely<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:24.570> think<00:04:24.870> more<00:04:25.050> than<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.199> you

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
completely I think more than that you

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.529 
completely I think more than that you
have<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.590> put<00:04:25.830> yourself<00:04:26.759> back<00:04:27.150> into<00:04:27.360> the

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
have to put yourself back into the

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.420 
have to put yourself back into the
enjoyment<00:04:28.229> of<00:04:28.349> pretending

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
enjoyment of pretending

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.290 
enjoyment of pretending
whereas<00:04:29.820> in<00:04:30.060> live<00:04:30.240> action<00:04:30.509> you<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:32.300> it's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
whereas in live action you do it's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.800 
whereas in live action you do it's
different<00:04:33.599> it's<00:04:33.780> more<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.050> laid-back

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
different it's more a laid-back

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.870 
different it's more a laid-back
conversation<00:04:36.810> where's<00:04:36.990> open<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:38.460> really

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
conversation where's open you really

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.180 
conversation where's open you really
have<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.120> pretend<00:04:39.479> like<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:40.190> three-year-old

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
have to pretend like your three-year-old

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.100 
have to pretend like your three-year-old
room<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.580> voiceover<00:04:42.090> except<00:04:42.599> you<00:04:42.720> can<00:04:42.870> talk

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
room is voiceover except you can talk

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.620 
room is voiceover except you can talk
and<00:04:43.260> lead<00:04:43.940> that's<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.090> would<00:04:45.240> say<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.419> both

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and lead that's I would say you both

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.390 
and lead that's I would say you both
both<00:04:46.139> times<00:04:46.380> just<00:04:46.500> be<00:04:46.650> uninhibited<00:04:46.949> but<00:04:47.280> it's

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
both times just be uninhibited but it's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.640 
both times just be uninhibited but it's
two<00:04:47.550> different<00:04:47.610> types

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:51.430 

then<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.710> discovered<00:04:56.190> that<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:04.680> did<00:05:06.440> always

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.750 

it's<00:05:52.440> almost<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.920> you<00:05:53.070> need<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.280> do<00:05:53.370> every

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
it's almost like you need to do every

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.830 
it's almost like you need to do every
voice<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.180> cartoon

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
and I'd like to look at it and I asked

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.980 
and I'd like to look at it and I asked
before<00:05:57.700> we<00:05:57.940> need<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.180> sometimes<00:05:58.450> I<00:05:58.720> want<00:05:58.900> you
