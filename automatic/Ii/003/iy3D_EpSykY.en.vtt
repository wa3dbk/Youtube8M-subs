you're not familiar with a glycemic
index<00:00:13.620> let<00:00:13.799> me<00:00:13.920> bring<00:00:14.130> clarity<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.509> is

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
index let me bring clarity to what it is

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.810 
index let me bring clarity to what it is
because<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.199> holes<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because there's holes in it and the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.609 
because there's holes in it and the
glycemic<00:00:18.119> index<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.690> some<00:00:18.869> benefits<00:00:19.320> because

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
glycemic index has some benefits because

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.859 
glycemic index has some benefits because
we've<00:00:20.010> benefited<00:00:20.640> from<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.539> played<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
we've benefited from it and it played a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
we've benefited from it and it played a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
index was created in 1981 and it was
created<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> help<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.180> diabetics<00:00:33.840> they

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
created to help out diabetics they

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380 
created to help out diabetics they
looked<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> single<00:00:35.489> food<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
looked at a single food there was a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290 
looked at a single food there was a
carbohydrates<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.530> they<00:00:38.160> compared<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:38.910> fast

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
carbohydrates and they compared how fast

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.720 
carbohydrates and they compared how fast
that<00:00:39.600> food<00:00:39.870> broke<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.530> when<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> ate<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that food broke down when you ate it and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
that food broke down when you ate it and
became<00:00:42.420> sugar<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.140> blood

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
became sugar in your blood

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
became sugar in your blood
they<00:00:44.309> gave<00:00:44.610> glucose<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> pure<00:00:45.930> sugar

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
they gave glucose which is pure sugar

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.549 
they gave glucose which is pure sugar
the<00:00:47.070> number<00:00:47.399> 100<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.110> compared

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the number 100 and then they compared

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
the number 100 and then they compared
all<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.039> foods<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> amount<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> 50

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
all the other foods in the amount of 50

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
all the other foods in the amount of 50
grams<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.030> 50<00:00:54.449> grams<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
grams so they would take 50 grams of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
grams so they would take 50 grams of
banana<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.940> then<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> eat

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
banana and then they would have you eat

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
banana and then they would have you eat
it<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.680> would<00:00:58.829> monitor<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it and then they would monitor you and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
it and then they would monitor you and
see<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:00.420> fast<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> banana<00:01:01.379> broke<00:01:01.680> down<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
see how fast that banana broke down and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
see how fast that banana broke down and
became<00:01:02.219> sugar<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> blood<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.329> banana<00:01:04.080> based

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
became sugar in the blood a banana based

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
became sugar in the blood a banana based
on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> glycemic<00:01:05.479> index<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.720> given<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> number

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
on the glycemic index is given a number

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.960 
on the glycemic index is given a number
70<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.750> glucose<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> given<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> number<00:01:11.070> 100<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
70 now glucose is given a number 100 so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.250 
70 now glucose is given a number 100 so
a<00:01:12.240> banana<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.080> like

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
a banana would be like

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.350 
a banana would be like
middle-of-the-road<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:14.909> high<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
middle-of-the-road it's not too high and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
middle-of-the-road it's not too high and
it's<00:01:15.810> definitely<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.770> low<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's definitely not too low so a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
it's definitely not too low so a
diabetic<00:01:18.060> may<00:01:18.420> consume<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.020> banana<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.950> they

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
diabetic may consume a banana but they

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.060 
diabetic may consume a banana but they
would<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.909> caution<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> first

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
would do it with caution the first

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
would do it with caution the first
question<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> comes<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
question I have with when it comes to a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.289 
question I have with when it comes to a
banana<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.700> came<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
banana and how they came up with the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.950 
banana and how they came up with the
number<00:01:27.570> 70<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.799> type<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> banana<00:01:29.960> did

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
number 70 is what type of banana did

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.490 
number 70 is what type of banana did
they<00:01:31.200> test<00:01:31.790> okay<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.630> banana<00:01:33.840> which<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
they test okay this banana which is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.039 
they test okay this banana which is
closer<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> green<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.659> closer<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
closer to green when it's closer to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.210 
closer to green when it's closer to
green<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.340> higher<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:40.220> starch

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
green is going to be higher in starch

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.120 
green is going to be higher in starch
and<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:42.689> starch<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> eaten<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.680> broken<00:01:43.979> down

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and when starch is eaten and broken down

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.539 
and when starch is eaten and broken down
it<00:01:44.369> does<00:01:44.640> become<00:01:45.149> sugar<00:01:45.810> eventually<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.189> it's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it does become sugar eventually but it's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.039 
it does become sugar eventually but it's
tart<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> convert<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> sugar

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
tart so it's going to convert to sugar

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.440 
tart so it's going to convert to sugar
slore<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.970> were<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> grab<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
slore where is if I were to grab a
banana<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.140> brown<00:01:52.350> spots<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
banana with brown spots on it this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
banana with brown spots on it this
banana<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.810> high<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.530> sugar

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
banana is going to be high as in sugar

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.209 
banana is going to be high as in sugar
right<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:58.229> already<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.770> highest

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
right now if it's already like highest

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.620 
right now if it's already like highest
and<00:01:59.369> sugar<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> convert<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and sugar then it's going to convert to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
and sugar then it's going to convert to
sugar<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.079> blood<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:01.950> faster

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
sugar in your blood a little bit faster

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
sugar in your blood a little bit faster
so<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> question<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> would<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so the question I would have for the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.039 
so the question I would have for the
people<00:02:04.560> who<00:02:04.799> created<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> glycemic<00:02:05.729> index

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
people who created the glycemic index

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
people who created the glycemic index
did<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.229> base<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> number<00:02:07.979> 70<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
did you base the number 70 on this

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.949 
did you base the number 70 on this
panetta

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
panetta

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.860 
panetta
or<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.009> banana<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> could<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
or on this banana because it could be

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.840 
or on this banana because it could be
this<00:02:13.020> banana

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
this banana

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.700 
this banana
you<00:02:13.970> may<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.150> eating<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.600> banana<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.230> then

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
you may be eating this banana and then

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.740 
you may be eating this banana and then
get<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> glycemic<00:02:16.640> effect<00:02:17.090> meaning<00:02:17.570> it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
get the glycemic effect meaning it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.840 
get the glycemic effect meaning it
becomes<00:02:18.170> sugar<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.500> your<00:02:18.590> blood<00:02:18.860> way<00:02:19.190> faster

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
becomes sugar in your blood way faster

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.180 
becomes sugar in your blood way faster
than<00:02:20.300> what<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.720> glycemic<00:02:21.110> index<00:02:21.260> would

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
than what the glycemic index would

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.670 
than what the glycemic index would
predict<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.880> makes<00:02:23.480> sense<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.290> at<00:02:24.470> that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
predict that makes sense so at that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.010 
predict that makes sense so at that
moment<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:25.700> tells<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.300> can't<00:02:26.690> go<00:02:26.810> by<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
moment it tells me I can't go by the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.380 
moment it tells me I can't go by the
glycemic<00:02:27.470> index<00:02:27.910> let<00:02:28.910> me<00:02:28.970> give<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:29.300> more

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
glycemic index let me give you one more

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.700 
glycemic index let me give you one more
example<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:30.640> potato<00:02:31.870> right<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:33.080> given<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
example a potato right is given the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.660 
example a potato right is given the
number<00:02:34.010> 95<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:36.440> you're<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> type-2<00:02:37.070> diabetic

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
number 95 so if you're a type-2 diabetic

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.230 
number 95 so if you're a type-2 diabetic
you<00:02:38.360> may<00:02:38.660> avoid<00:02:39.140> most<00:02:40.010> potatoes<00:02:40.340> now<00:02:41.120> I've

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you may avoid most potatoes now I've

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.460 
you may avoid most potatoes now I've
seen<00:02:41.450> some<00:02:41.750> potatoes

right<00:03:04.730> they're<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> little<00:03:06.080> bit<00:03:06.230> more<00:03:06.260> process

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
right they're a little bit more process

right they're a little bit more process
they're<00:03:07.550> further<00:03:08.030> from<00:03:08.360> nature<00:03:08.710> but<00:03:09.710> on<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
potato chips and you monitor how fast

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
blood is given the number 55 so if I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040 
blood is given the number 55 so if I

wanted to keep my blood sugar levels

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.770 
wanted to keep my blood sugar levels
lower<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.880> was<00:03:26.000> gonna<00:03:26.090> eat<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.420> same

I'm less likely to go into fat storage
mold<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:42.320> then<00:03:42.470> my<00:03:42.590> question<00:03:42.830> is<00:03:43.160> okay<00:03:43.540> you're

shocking me Robert you're blowing me

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.640 
shocking me Robert you're blowing me
away<00:03:46.730> you're<00:03:47.660> telling<00:03:48.050> us<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.170> eat<00:03:48.290> potato

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
away you're telling us to eat potato

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.560 
away you're telling us to eat potato
chips<00:03:48.740> no<00:03:49.250> I'm<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.610> saying<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.000> eat<00:03:50.210> potato

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
chips no I'm not saying to go eat potato

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.750 
chips no I'm not saying to go eat potato
chips<00:03:50.870> what<00:03:51.650> I'm<00:03:51.800> sharing<00:03:52.160> with<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.520> is<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
chips what I'm sharing with you is the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.100 
chips what I'm sharing with you is the
science<00:03:53.210> of<00:03:53.330> how<00:03:53.390> all<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.720> comes<00:03:53.930> together

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
science of how all this comes together

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.920 
science of how all this comes together
and<00:03:54.590> why<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.040> can't<00:03:55.520> just<00:03:55.610> go<00:03:56.240> by<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
and why you can't just go by the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.500 
and why you can't just go by the
glycemic<00:03:57.350> index<00:03:57.790> number<00:03:58.790> one<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.150> glycemic

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
glycemic index number one the glycemic

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.770 
glycemic index number one the glycemic
index<00:03:59.690> is<00:04:00.080> based<00:04:00.320> on<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> single<00:04:01.040> food<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:01.940> most

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
index is based on a single food and most

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.270 
index is based on a single food and most
of<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.050> time<00:04:03.260> when<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.560> eat<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.710> potato<00:04:03.860> you're

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
of the time when you eat a potato you're

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.430 
of the time when you eat a potato you're
not<00:04:04.460> eating<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.790> potato<00:04:04.940> by<00:04:05.360> itself<00:04:05.720> you're

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
not eating a potato by itself you're

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.550 
not eating a potato by itself you're
eating<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:06.800> with<00:04:06.920> something<00:04:07.270> see<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:09.080> reason

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
eating it with something see the reason

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.370 
eating it with something see the reason
the<00:04:09.650> potato<00:04:10.010> chips<00:04:10.540> register<00:04:11.540> lower<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:12.170> how

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
the potato chips register lower on how

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.500 
the potato chips register lower on how
fast<00:04:12.710> it<00:04:12.950> becomes<00:04:13.310> sugar<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.910> your<00:04:14.030> blood<00:04:14.270> is

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
fast it becomes sugar in your blood is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.960 
fast it becomes sugar in your blood is
because<00:04:14.900> there's<00:04:15.170> fat<00:04:15.560> inside<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.850> potato

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
because there's fat inside of the potato

and add it to my potato the butter now

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.780 
and add it to my potato the butter now
will<00:04:24.200> slow<00:04:24.530> down<00:04:24.560> because<00:04:25.310> I'm<00:04:25.490> eating<00:04:25.669> it

is<00:04:57.300> gonna<00:04:57.450> slow<00:04:57.750> down<00:04:57.780> how<00:04:58.110> fast<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.650> potato

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
is gonna slow down how fast the potato

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.640 
is gonna slow down how fast the potato
becomes<00:04:59.490> sugar<00:05:00.090> in<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.270> blood<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:01.410> fat

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.440 
becomes sugar in the blood the fat
that's<00:05:01.860> helping<00:05:02.190> it's<00:05:02.640> slowing<00:05:02.910> now<00:05:03.120> how<00:05:03.240> fast

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
that's helping it's slowing now how fast

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.420 
that's helping it's slowing now how fast
the<00:05:03.630> potato<00:05:03.930> become<00:05:04.230> sugar<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> blood<00:05:05.130> if

the potato become sugar in the blood if

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.040 
the potato become sugar in the blood if
I<00:05:05.580> have<00:05:05.730> broccoli<00:05:06.240> with<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.510> or<00:05:06.630> some<00:05:06.840> type

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
I have broccoli with that or some type

of high-fiber vegetable that fiber is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.990 
of high-fiber vegetable that fiber is
gonna<00:05:10.170> slow<00:05:10.440> down<00:05:10.470> how<00:05:10.860> fast<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.640> potato

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
gonna slow down how fast the potato

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.720 
gonna slow down how fast the potato
becomes<00:05:12.450> sugar<00:05:12.780> in<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.110> blood<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.430> meal

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
becomes sugar in the blood so the meal

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.390 
becomes sugar in the blood so the meal
working<00:05:15.330> together<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:16.560> actually<00:05:16.800> helping

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
working together is actually helping

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.680 
working together is actually helping

that<00:05:36.720> my<00:05:36.870> people<00:05:37.110> perish<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.919> lack<00:05:38.190> of

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
that my people perish for the lack of

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.850 
that my people perish for the lack of
knowledge<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.240> believe<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:40.440> if<00:05:40.560> we<00:05:40.590> have

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
knowledge and I believe that if we have

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.730 
knowledge and I believe that if we have
the<00:05:41.040> knowledge<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.820> then<00:05:42.750> we<00:05:42.870> apply<00:05:43.230> it<00:05:43.290> and

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
the knowledge and then we apply it and

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.460 
the knowledge and then we apply it and
we<00:05:44.460> feel<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.000> benefits<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:45.810> when<00:05:46.350> you're

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
we feel the benefits and when you're

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.260 
we feel the benefits and when you're
feeling<00:05:46.860> good<00:05:46.890> it's<00:05:47.730> like<00:05:47.790> when<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.060> know

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270
