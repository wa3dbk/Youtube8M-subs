features<00:03:09.360> have<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.660> think<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.560> yeah<00:03:10.739> but

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
features have that I think so yeah but

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.260 
features have that I think so yeah but
nice<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.640> wings<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:11.970> put<00:03:12.150> them

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
nice with the wings you can put them

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.850 
nice with the wings you can put them
back<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:12.720> let<00:03:12.840> them<00:03:12.959> stay<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.470> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
back and just let them stay there and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.000 
back and just let them stay there and
then<00:03:14.610> there's<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.060> course<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.780> thing<00:03:16.110> which

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
then there's of course this thing which

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.310 
then there's of course this thing which
you<00:03:17.130> put<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.400> his<00:03:17.580> mouth<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.660> shove<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.230> his

mouth like that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.940 
mouth like that
