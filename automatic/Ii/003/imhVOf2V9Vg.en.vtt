00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 we had to change seats we had to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.750
 work spent a lot of energy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.860

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.860
 pride in receiving our matches 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.559

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.390
 fined 28 thousand euros we have 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.920
 a private session that is to say that 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.430
 part of the tribune 3 that will be 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.540
 unfortunately closed is the message that 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.510
 I just wanted to pass 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.059
 to our supporters it is we are in 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.780
 European competition all together if 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.580
 we are playing this competition 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.869
 European on the pitch our supporters 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.729
 play this European competition in 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.300
 the stands it must be understood that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.950
 with uefa it's zero tolerance 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.520
 we can not afford the slightest 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.380
 gap 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.320
 we can not afford to throw the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 less paper on the ground we can 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.720
 not allow yourself to have the slightest 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.940
 sign that could be cataloged 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.310
 as a racist sign it's so 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.780
 very clear zero tolerance here and so 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.170
 our supporters must be 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.580
 aware of that and that they help us to 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.390
 continue to take steps in 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.369
 this european cup 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.050
 so I do not know how far we will go in 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.399
 anyway I want us to go the most 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.550
 far possible because it's gay 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.630
 nice and we take a liking 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.009
 and then we will do everything to be 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.200
 again the year after and maybe 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.450
 the one after that learning 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.729
 must be useful for everyone to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.140
 we for our supporters so that the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.649
 big family zebra continues his little 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.649
 European adventure
