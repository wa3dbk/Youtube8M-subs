okay<00:00:02.280> just<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.580> short<00:00:02.790> video<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:03.330> dodgy<00:00:04.140> k<00:00:04.290> 74

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
okay just a short video of my dodgy k 74

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay just a short video of my dodgy k 74
age<00:00:05.100> ye<00:00:05.629> came<00:00:06.629> bought<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.020> about<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.410> year<00:00:08.099> ago

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
age ye came bought it about a year ago

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
age ye came bought it about a year ago
for<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.580> five<00:00:08.790> hundred<00:00:08.940> dollars<00:00:09.360> came<00:00:09.990> with

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
for about five hundred dollars came with

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.009 
for about five hundred dollars came with
the<00:00:10.260> thing<00:00:10.889> was<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> fork<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.630> piece<00:00:12.630> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the thing was a fork a piece of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.720 
the thing was a fork a piece of
killed<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.559> probably<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.040> six<00:00:14.580> months

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
killed that probably in about six months

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.990 
killed that probably in about six months
and<00:00:15.030> decided<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.450> go<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> GE<00:00:16.139> route<00:00:17.000> so

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and decided to go the for a GE route so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.670 
and decided to go the for a GE route so
basically<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.480> transferring<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> JDM

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
basically just transferring all the JDM

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490 
basically just transferring all the JDM
sprinter<00:00:20.070> gear<00:00:20.310> straight<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.289> car

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
sprinter gear straight into the car

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.650 
sprinter gear straight into the car
everything<00:00:22.980> pretty<00:00:23.160> much<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> directly

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
everything pretty much is a directly

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200 
everything pretty much is a directly
interchangeable<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> engine<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
interchangeable so this is the engine I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.519 
interchangeable so this is the engine I
got<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> short<00:00:27.630> block<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> long<00:00:28.320> block

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
got the short block or the long block

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
got the short block or the long block
for<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.769> fifty<00:00:29.099> bucks<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> bolted<00:00:30.240> all

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
for about fifty bucks but I bolted all

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
for about fifty bucks but I bolted all
all<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> rear<00:00:31.109> wheel<00:00:31.260> drive<00:00:31.289> accessories

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
all the rear wheel drive accessories

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.790 
all the rear wheel drive accessories
that<00:00:32.340> came<00:00:32.460> off<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> other<00:00:32.940> sprint<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> set<00:00:33.450> up

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
that came off the other sprint to set up

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
that came off the other sprint to set up
running<00:00:34.800> 41<00:00:35.250> extractors<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
running 41 extractors to a two and a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.889 
running 41 extractors to a two and a
half<00:00:37.649> inch<00:00:37.910> exhaust<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.570> probably<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
half inch exhaust it's probably a little

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.330 
half inch exhaust it's probably a little
big<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.469> planning<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.770> putting<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> turbo

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
big but I'm planning on putting a turbo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.959 
big but I'm planning on putting a turbo
on<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.910> soon<00:00:43.340> i'm<00:00:44.340> running<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> health<00:00:44.789> tech

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
on pretty soon i'm running a health tech

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
on pretty soon i'm running a health tech
standalone<00:00:45.390> management<00:00:45.870> system<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
standalone management system one of the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.700 
standalone management system one of the
key<00:00:47.160> things<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.489> had<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> build<00:00:47.850> was<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.710> cam

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
key things i had to build was a cam

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
key things i had to build was a cam
angle<00:00:50.010> sensor<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> standard

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
angle sensor because the standard

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
angle sensor because the standard
factory<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> 4g<00:00:52.230> isn't<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
factory one from the 4g isn't really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
factory one from the 4g isn't really
compatible<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.489> haltech<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.420> inside<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
compatible with haltech so inside the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
compatible with haltech so inside the
distributor<00:00:55.469> i've<00:00:55.590> ripped<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
distributor i've ripped out most of the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
distributor i've ripped out most of the
components<00:00:57.350> for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> standard<00:00:58.800> camera<00:00:59.039> angle

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
components for the standard camera angle

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.240 
components for the standard camera angle
sensor<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> I've<00:00:59.760> jammed<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.559> $14<00:01:01.559> Jake<00:01:02.039> our

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sensor and I've jammed in a $14 Jake our

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.509 
sensor and I've jammed in a $14 Jake our
hall<00:01:02.430> effect<00:01:02.550> sensor<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:04.350> aluminium<00:01:04.979> disc

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
hall effect sensor and an aluminium disc

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.380 
hall effect sensor and an aluminium disc
that<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> machined<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> CSM<00:01:07.140> CNC<00:01:07.680> machine<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
that I machined on a CSM CNC machine and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
that I machined on a CSM CNC machine and
put<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.510> four<00:01:09.780> magnets<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.380> 90-degree<00:01:10.740> angles

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
put in four magnets at 90-degree angles

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
put in four magnets at 90-degree angles
from<00:01:11.340> each<00:01:11.490> other<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.909> basically<00:01:12.150> gives

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
from each other so that basically gives

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
from each other so that basically gives
the<00:01:12.659> computer<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.650> RPM<00:01:14.010> signal<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> our

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the computer the RPM signal that our

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910 
the computer the RPM signal that our
needs<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.780> crank<00:01:16.020> angle<00:01:16.170> position<00:01:16.799> as

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
needs and the crank angle position as

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.050 
needs and the crank angle position as
well<00:01:19.009> alright<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.729> quality

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
well alright so there's some quality

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.850 
well alright so there's some quality
components<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.020> thought<00:01:22.170> I'd<00:01:22.290> show

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
components here just thought I'd show

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
components here just thought I'd show
standard<00:01:25.860> haltech<00:01:26.250> temperature<00:01:27.000> sensor

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
standard haltech temperature sensor

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
standard haltech temperature sensor
doesn't<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.320> screw<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
doesn't actually really screw in so I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.649 
doesn't actually really screw in so I
just<00:01:29.640> thought<00:01:29.790> I'd<00:01:29.850> strip<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> little

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
just thought I'd strip it in a little

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.880 
just thought I'd strip it in a little
bit<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.439> gas<00:01:31.590> could<00:01:31.799> go

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
bit and then just put some gas could go

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
bit and then just put some gas could go
around<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.729> far<00:01:33.000> holding<00:01:33.570> holding<00:01:33.869> solid

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
around it so far holding holding solid

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
around it so far holding holding solid
up<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.009> 8,000<00:01:35.400> rpm<00:01:35.990> similarly<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.290> little

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
up to 8,000 rpm similarly for my little

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.490 
up to 8,000 rpm similarly for my little
aluminium<00:01:38.159> wheel<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.880> my<00:01:38.970> little

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
aluminium wheel in here with my little

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.670 
aluminium wheel in here with my little
Hall<00:01:40.500> effect<00:01:40.619> sensor<00:01:40.829> holding<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:41.850> 8000rpm

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
Hall effect sensor holding at 8000rpm

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520 
Hall effect sensor holding at 8000rpm
huh<00:01:43.909> temperature<00:01:44.909> sensor<00:01:45.299> yep<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
huh temperature sensor yep that's in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
huh temperature sensor yep that's in
there<00:01:46.710> solid<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.399> sort<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> give<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> bit

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there solid just sort of give it a bit

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.190 
there solid just sort of give it a bit
of<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> squish<00:01:48.479> should<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:50.869> i'm<00:01:51.869> running

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.080 

just<00:01:59.740> pretty<00:02:00.160> much<00:02:00.310> standard<00:02:00.760> straight

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
just pretty much standard straight

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.360 
just pretty much standard straight
through<00:02:01.330> muffler<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> VL<00:02:02.800> turbo<00:02:03.070> fuel

through muffler with a VL turbo fuel
pump<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:06.550> see<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:07.020> let's<00:02:08.020> get<00:02:08.170> just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
pump and you can see it let's get just

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.889 
pump and you can see it let's get just
the<00:02:08.380> veal<00:02:08.530> turbo<00:02:08.860> fuel<00:02:09.009> pump<00:02:09.310> set<00:02:09.520> up<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.899> I'm

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the veal turbo fuel pump set up and I'm

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.920 
the veal turbo fuel pump set up and I'm
using<00:02:11.320> at<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> moment<00:02:15.510> look<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.630> can't<00:02:16.810> do

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
using at the moment look I can't do

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.180 
using at the moment look I can't do
documentaries<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.560> look<00:02:17.770> i'm<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
documentaries a look i'm just going to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
documentaries a look i'm just going to
 it<00:02:18.460> get<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.330> here<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.510> start<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.810> up

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.210 

alright<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.410> key<00:02:26.590> feature<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.070> i<00:02:27.130> forgot

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
alright so the key feature that i forgot

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.800 
alright so the key feature that i forgot
to<00:02:27.340> point<00:02:27.550> out<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.910> i'm<00:02:28.060> running<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.360> innovate

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
to point out was i'm running a innovate

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.620 
to point out was i'm running a innovate
lc-1<00:02:29.260> wideband<00:02:30.190> oxygen<00:02:30.610> sensor<00:02:30.970> there's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
lc-1 wideband oxygen sensor there's

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.850 
lc-1 wideband oxygen sensor there's
little<00:02:31.870> gauge<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.290> right<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.650> showing

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
little gauge on the right there showing

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610 
little gauge on the right there showing
a<00:02:33.070> current<00:02:33.910> AFI<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.270> 21.9<00:02:35.020> which<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.350> roughly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a current AFI of 21.9 which is roughly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.449 
a current AFI of 21.9 which is roughly
air<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> think<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:38.470> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> more

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
air I think you can see that more

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.560 
air I think you can see that more
importantly<00:02:40.800> sort<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.070> broadly<00:02:42.450> then<00:02:43.450> if

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
importantly sort of just broadly then if

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.080 
importantly sort of just broadly then if
you<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.720> see<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.020> it's<00:02:44.170> basically<00:02:44.470> just

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you can see that it's basically just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.220 
you can see that it's basically just
screwed<00:02:46.090> into<00:02:46.270> just<00:02:46.750> before<00:02:46.990> where<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
screwed into just before where the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.960 
screwed into just before where the
catalytic<00:02:47.620> converter<00:02:47.890> would<00:02:48.040> be<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
catalytic converter would be is the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.990 
catalytic converter would be is the
ideal<00:02:49.270> spot<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.410> gases<00:02:50.740> are<00:02:50.830> mixed

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.050 

I'll<00:02:55.000> take<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.360> six<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:56.160> dodgy<00:02:57.160> win98<00:02:57.580> laptop

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I'll take a six a dodgy win98 laptop

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.900 
I'll take a six a dodgy win98 laptop
running<00:02:58.360> dodji<00:02:59.170> da<00:02:59.800> software<00:03:00.310> why<00:03:00.430> she's<00:03:00.700> not

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
running dodji da software why she's not

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.680 
running dodji da software why she's not
OMG<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:02.260> pretty<00:03:02.440> stable<00:03:06.209> good<00:03:07.209> old<00:03:07.330> serial

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
OMG it's pretty stable good old serial

OMG it's pretty stable good old serial
data<00:03:07.840> right<00:03:09.120> transfer<00:03:10.120> not<00:03:10.330> very<00:03:10.510> fast<00:03:10.660> but

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
data right transfer not very fast but

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.330 
data right transfer not very fast but
anyway<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.709> moment<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> computer<00:03:12.280> is

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
anyway so the moment the computer is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.950 
anyway so the moment the computer is
connecting<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.850> hell<00:03:13.000> tech

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:30.110 

okay<00:03:20.680> we're<00:03:20.860> in<00:03:21.960> this<00:03:22.960> is<00:03:23.080> how<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> do<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:27.060> yep
