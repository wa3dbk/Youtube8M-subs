00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.410 

okay<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.280> I<00:00:28.310> don't<00:00:28.490> have<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:28.820> do<00:00:28.940> number<00:00:29.240> two

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
okay so I don't have to do number two

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.140 
okay so I don't have to do number two
and<00:00:29.720> only<00:00:29.810> get<00:00:29.990> to<00:00:30.110> new<00:00:30.230> number<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:30.850> so<00:00:31.850> we<00:00:32.029> do

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
and only get to new number one so we do

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.260 
and only get to new number one so we do
number<00:00:32.419> one<00:00:33.160> there's<00:00:34.160> still<00:00:34.489> Flint's<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.059> this

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
number one there's still Flint's on this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.470 
number one there's still Flint's on this
thing<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.200> you<00:00:36.950> just<00:00:37.160> use<00:00:37.340> one<00:00:37.850> piece<00:00:38.150> that's

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
thing and you just use one piece that's

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.840 
thing and you just use one piece that's
what<00:00:39.940> so<00:00:40.940> that's<00:00:41.210> if<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:41.840> do<00:00:42.020> number<00:00:42.320> one<00:00:42.850> my

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
what so that's if you do number one my

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.229 
what so that's if you do number one my
bit<00:00:44.769> sometimes<00:00:45.769> it<00:00:46.070> gets<00:00:46.220> tucked<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.730> going<00:00:47.090> on

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
bit sometimes it gets tucked it going on

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.259 
bit sometimes it gets tucked it going on
it<00:00:49.660> think<00:00:50.769> all<00:00:51.769> right<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.220> if<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:52.790> have<00:00:52.970> to<00:00:53.120> go

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
it think all right but if you have to go

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.530 
it think all right but if you have to go
number<00:00:53.540> two<00:00:54.370> use<00:00:55.370> two<00:00:55.730> pieces<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.269> paper

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
number two use two pieces to a paper

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.110 
number two use two pieces to a paper
that's<00:00:57.110> why<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.470> called<00:00:57.650> that<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.670> here's

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
that's why it's called that so here's

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.609 
that's why it's called that so here's
two<00:00:59.360> pieces<00:00:59.540> like<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:04.720> all<00:01:05.720> right<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.110> now<00:01:06.289> you

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
two pieces like so all right so now you

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.280 
two pieces like so all right so now you
wipe

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.090 

so<00:01:11.890> then<00:01:12.070> usually<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:13.120> have<00:01:13.330> some<00:01:14.100> Coulomb

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
so then usually you have some Coulomb

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.530 
so then usually you have some Coulomb
here<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.520> don't<00:01:15.730> have<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.510> now

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
here I don't have to do that right now

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.730 
here I don't have to do that right now
so<00:01:16.930> then<00:01:17.740> after<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.100> do<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:19.230> fold<00:01:20.230> it<00:01:24.390> right

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so then after you do that fold it right

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.859 
so then after you do that fold it right
up<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.890> do<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:28.200> fold<00:01:29.200> it

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.170 

but<00:01:35.439> hold<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.110 

pump<00:01:40.070> hold<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.420 

okay<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.590> usually<00:01:47.590> at<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:47.890> point<00:01:47.980> you're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
okay and usually at this point you're

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.880 
okay and usually at this point you're
pretty<00:01:48.580> much<00:01:48.760> done<00:01:49.000> if<00:01:49.270> not<00:01:49.330> just<00:01:49.870> stick<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.800> in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
pretty much done if not just stick it in

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.280 
pretty much done if not just stick it in
and<00:01:51.190> hold<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.210> there<00:01:52.480> for<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.750> little<00:01:52.900> bit<00:01:53.050> and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
and hold it there for a little bit and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.720 
and hold it there for a little bit and
you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.650> leave<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.070> or<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.430> can<00:01:54.550> take<00:01:54.670> it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
you can leave it in or you can take it

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.940 
you can leave it in or you can take it
out<00:01:54.910> whatever<00:01:55.210> but<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.660> way<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.900> help<00:01:56.740> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
out whatever but that way you help it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.980 
out whatever but that way you help it
from<00:01:57.190> coming<00:01:57.430> out<00:01:57.640> more<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.300> it's<00:01:58.479> like<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> plug

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
from coming out more so it's like a plug

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.140 
from coming out more so it's like a plug
kind<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.190> then<00:02:00.520> when<00:02:00.640> you're<00:02:00.729> done<00:02:00.820> put<00:02:01.060> it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
kind of and then when you're done put it

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.750 
kind of and then when you're done put it
in<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.300> party<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.350> some<00:02:03.070> people<00:02:03.190> use<00:02:03.369> more

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
in the party so some people use more

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.850 
in the party so some people use more
than<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.240> would<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.600> suggested<00:02:05.260> because

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
than that I would have suggested because

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.920 
than that I would have suggested because
you<00:02:06.190> don't<00:02:06.369> want<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.550> kill<00:02:06.729> people<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:07.270> trees

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you don't want to kill people in trees

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.230 
you don't want to kill people in trees
