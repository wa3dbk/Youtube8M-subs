anymore<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> USC<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
anymore because of the USC but with a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.990 
anymore because of the USC but with a
momentum<00:01:12.210> dispel<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.729> abilities<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
momentum dispel that the abilities that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
momentum dispel that the abilities that
automatically<00:01:15.990> does<00:01:16.409> came<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.770> still<00:01:17.549> not

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
automatically does came up still not

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
automatically does came up still not
work<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.900> yeah<00:01:20.600> that's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
work so yeah that's a little that is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.840 
work so yeah that's a little that is
pretty<00:01:23.520> much<00:01:24.500> bad<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.700> able

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pretty much bad because it will be able

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.609 
pretty much bad because it will be able
to<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.180> abilities<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.200> would<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.320> much

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to use abilities there would be much

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.240 
to use abilities there would be much
wants<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> kill<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.170> my<00:01:31.189> throat<00:01:32.189> hurts

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
speak somewhat quite and yeah so but

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.120 
speak somewhat quite and yeah so but
because<00:01:38.909> abilities<00:01:39.479> doesn't<00:01:39.810> work<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.920> takes

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
because abilities doesn't work it takes

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889 
because abilities doesn't work it takes
a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> time<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.729> kill<00:01:41.790> them<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> did

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
a lot of time to kill them so if you did

a lot of time to kill them so if you did
well<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.380> work<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.280> much
