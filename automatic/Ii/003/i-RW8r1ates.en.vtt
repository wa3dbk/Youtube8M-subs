00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 this news is presented by 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.109
 catholic university campus itapÃºa la 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.740
 tradition of training the best 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.480
 the sheep 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.510
 practically all that 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580
 they survived with serious injuries in the 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.260
 neck 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.900
 what died were cornered 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.430
 there in the own place there in the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.530
 corner all over 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.770
 and with quite a big wound in the 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.770
 neck 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.149
 todd and is dead and what 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.520
 they survived had wound also of 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.500
 very big neck and what he bit him 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.980
 in the arm some are broken if I do not 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.720
 I have a lot of knowledge because 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.269
 the first one that happened to me now and it's weird 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.239
 I did a tour in this until 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.370
 12 at night and like everything was 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.379
 all right 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.360
 I went and reassured me, and then 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.219
 the morning that you do now divine 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.790
 corroborates again and it was all in 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:10.479
 order and with this surprise now if 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.570
 the awesome disaster did not know how 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.210
 explain it if we find a trace 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.810
 pretty big I did not know what to tell you what 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 animal 9 but it is not but the footprints 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.090
 very big that came from the mountain 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.369
 I do not believe in the magnitude of the cruelty 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.539
 of the animals I do not think it was a dog 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:38.280
 because I was dying of quite hard 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.280
 I would tell you because even broken legs 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.450
 he did it we woke up a very surprise 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.110
 unpleasant and it's a very weird case 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.760
 facing the deaths 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 sheep 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.360
 they found that clues and for 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.190
 this morning very early the call 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.680
 He said that his foreman 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.960
 He woke up with a few dead sheep 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.210
 and other immediate injuries I constituted 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 to verify the fact and one in the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.860
 place we start to verify with the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.739
 foreman we found the sheep already 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.890
 some of them were dead, he would bring them and 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.569
 through the meticulous impression to the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.690
 animals we could see that most of 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.420
 the dead animals had a trace of 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.190
 tusks of some alkaline animal 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.510
 presumably because we do not know now 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.660
 it was the animal that produces animal 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.660
 wound 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.599
 and other traces that we had because 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.579
 we had a lot of rain in the course of 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.730
 early morning and because of that it was erased 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.310
 all traces but some traces 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.480
 from some animal feet they stayed that 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.989
 it was very deep that it could not be 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.840
 erased by the rain 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.250
 the first time according to the locals of the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.639
 zone and migrates from the first time that jona 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.849
 bone area that very clear the fact that 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.849
 occurred
