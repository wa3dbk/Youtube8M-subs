the<00:03:26.720> bottom<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.910> I've<00:03:28.910> got<00:03:29.209> these<00:03:29.420> oak<00:03:29.690> leaves

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
the bottom and I've got these oak leaves

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.690 
the bottom and I've got these oak leaves
and<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.470> reason<00:03:30.830> these<00:03:31.010> oak<00:03:31.250> leaves<00:03:31.520> are

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
and the reason these oak leaves are

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490 
and the reason these oak leaves are
going<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.910> keep<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.300> pickles<00:03:32.720> crunchy<00:03:33.290> is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
going to keep the pickles crunchy is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.009 
going to keep the pickles crunchy is
because<00:03:34.280> there's<00:03:34.550> tannins<00:03:35.300> in<00:03:35.510> them<00:03:35.780> that

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
because there's tannins in them that

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.400 
because there's tannins in them that
will<00:03:36.170> inhibit<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.150> enzymatic<00:03:38.200> activity<00:03:39.200> of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
will inhibit the enzymatic activity of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.520 
will inhibit the enzymatic activity of
the<00:03:39.590> cucumber<00:03:40.220> from<00:03:40.760> basically<00:03:41.660> consuming

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
the cucumber from basically consuming

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
the cucumber from basically consuming
itself<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.160> having<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.239> middle<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
itself and having the middle of the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.259 
itself and having the middle of the
cucumber<00:03:45.170> get<00:03:45.560> soft<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.489> starting<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
cucumber get soft and starting to

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.120 
cucumber get soft and starting to
disintegrate<00:03:47.600> basically<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:48.920> that's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
disintegrate basically and so that's

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.130 
disintegrate basically and so that's
what<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.310> want<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:49.760> want<00:03:50.060> some<00:03:50.269> tannins<00:03:50.930> to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
what you want you want some tannins to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.009 
what you want you want some tannins to
inhibit<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.920> enzyme<00:03:52.640> attic<00:03:53.180> activity<00:03:53.810> of

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
inhibit that enzyme attic activity of

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.100 
inhibit that enzyme attic activity of
the<00:03:54.500> cucumber<00:03:54.860> from<00:03:55.160> basically<00:03:56.110> digesting

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
the cucumber from basically digesting

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.800 
the cucumber from basically digesting
itself<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.950> I've<00:03:58.100> picked<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.670> oops<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.690> dropped

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
itself so I've picked out oops I dropped

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.290 
itself so I've picked out oops I dropped
the<00:04:00.200> drop<00:04:00.380> on<00:04:00.560> here<00:04:00.830> I've<00:04:01.760> picked<00:04:02.239> out<00:04:02.470> six

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
the drop on here I've picked out six

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.479 
the drop on here I've picked out six
well<00:04:05.330> I<00:04:05.420> now<00:04:05.630> have<00:04:05.840> four<00:04:05.870> oh<00:04:06.410> please<00:04:07.250> I'm<00:04:07.459> just

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
well I now have four oh please I'm just

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.740 
well I now have four oh please I'm just
dropping<00:04:07.820> them<00:04:08.090> all<00:04:08.150> over<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.420> place<00:04:08.570> that's

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
dropping them all over the place that's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.330 
dropping them all over the place that's
why<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:08.959> got<00:04:09.140> so<00:04:09.260> many<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.530> them<00:04:09.739> but<00:04:10.190> I<00:04:10.220> have

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
why I got so many of them but I have

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.280 
why I got so many of them but I have
four<00:04:10.550> oak<00:04:10.760> leaves<00:04:11.000> here<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.959> I'm<00:04:12.050> going<00:04:12.260> to

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
four oak leaves here that I'm going to

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.790 
four oak leaves here that I'm going to
put<00:04:12.590> into<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> bottom<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.670> jar

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
put into the bottom of the jar

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.560 
put into the bottom of the jar
and<00:04:14.890> they're<00:04:15.370> pretty<00:04:15.520> big<00:04:15.760> oak<00:04:15.940> leaves<00:04:16.239> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and they're pretty big oak leaves and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.660 
and they're pretty big oak leaves and
then<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.410> next<00:04:17.739> thing<00:04:17.860> I'm<00:04:18.010> going<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.220> do<00:04:18.459> is

then the next thing I'm going to do is

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.050 
then the next thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:18.820> going<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.120> put<00:04:19.450> in<00:04:19.780> my<00:04:20.590> cucumbers<00:04:21.280> this

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
I'm going to put in my cucumbers this

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.610 
I'm going to put in my cucumbers this
will<00:04:22.210> take<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.420> couple<00:04:22.690> of<00:04:22.900> seconds<00:04:23.350> while<00:04:23.590> I

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
will take a couple of seconds while I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.950 
will take a couple of seconds while I
pile<00:04:23.950> these<00:04:24.280> cucumbers<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.180> top<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.840> the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
pile these cucumbers in on top of the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.030 
pile these cucumbers in on top of the
seasonings<00:04:28.050> by<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.110> way<00:04:29.290> if<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.530> don't<00:04:29.770> have

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
seasonings by the way if you don't have

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.350 
seasonings by the way if you don't have
any<00:04:30.250> oak<00:04:30.460> leaves<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.690> use<00:04:31.960> as<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.790> process<00:04:33.790> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
any oak leaves to use as the process to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.030 
any oak leaves to use as the process to
add<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.690> tannins<00:04:35.230> for<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.560> crunchy<00:04:35.860> pickles

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
add the tannins for the crunchy pickles

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.490 
add the tannins for the crunchy pickles
you<00:04:36.640> can<00:04:36.850> use<00:04:37.030> fresh<00:04:37.510> bay<00:04:38.050> leaves

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
you can use fresh bay leaves

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.140 
you can use fresh bay leaves
-<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:38.830> notice<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.220> dry<00:04:39.490> bay<00:04:39.760> leaves<00:04:40.000> in

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
- you notice I have dry bay leaves in

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.850 
- you notice I have dry bay leaves in
here<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.510> seasoning<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.350> would<00:04:41.500> need<00:04:41.680> some

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
here for seasoning you would need some

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.220 
here for seasoning you would need some
fresh<00:04:42.220> bay<00:04:42.520> leaves<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.240> can<00:04:43.390> also<00:04:43.630> use<00:04:43.990> some

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
fresh bay leaves you can also use some

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.130 
fresh bay leaves you can also use some
fresh<00:04:44.560> grape<00:04:44.980> leaves<00:04:45.340> as<00:04:45.700> well<00:04:45.810> now<00:04:46.810> as<00:04:46.990> an

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
fresh grape leaves as well now as an

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.740 
fresh grape leaves as well now as an
alternative<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.830> using<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.580> leaves<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.570> can

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
alternative to using the leaves you can

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.580 
alternative to using the leaves you can
also<00:04:50.020> replace<00:04:50.770> up<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> half<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.600> water<00:04:52.870> with

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
also replace up to half the water with

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.590 
also replace up to half the water with
apple<00:04:54.010> cider<00:04:54.220> vinegar<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.940> has<00:04:55.120> been<00:04:55.300> boiled

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
apple cider vinegar that has been boiled

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.140 
apple cider vinegar that has been boiled
and<00:04:55.990> then<00:04:56.050> cooled<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.790> will<00:04:57.940> add<00:04:58.120> some

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
and then cooled and that will add some

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600 
and then cooled and that will add some
tannins<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.260> process<00:04:59.650> as<00:04:59.770> well<00:04:59.980> but<00:05:00.370> since

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
tannins to the process as well but since

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.400 
tannins to the process as well but since
boiling<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.480> cooling<00:05:01.870> apple<00:05:02.140> cider<00:05:02.260> vinegar

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
boiling and cooling apple cider vinegar

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.160 
boiling and cooling apple cider vinegar
takes<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.490> bit<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.760> time<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.360> thought<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:04.930> would

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
takes a bit of time I thought it would

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.080 
takes a bit of time I thought it would
be<00:05:05.320> better<00:05:05.560> if<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:05.890> just<00:05:06.040> use<00:05:06.400> leaves<00:05:06.700> for<00:05:07.030> the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
be better if we just use leaves for the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.910 
be better if we just use leaves for the
video<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:07.720> that's<00:05:07.930> why<00:05:08.140> I<00:05:08.170> chose<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.740> oak

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
video so that's why I chose the oak

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.070 
video so that's why I chose the oak
leaves<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.430> plus<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.270> some<00:05:10.720> really<00:05:10.900> nice

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
leaves and plus I have some really nice

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.780 
leaves and plus I have some really nice
oak<00:05:11.350> trees<00:05:11.620> in<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.860> front<00:05:11.980> yard<00:05:12.130> so<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:12.550> just

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
oak trees in the front yard so I just

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.670 
oak trees in the front yard so I just
went<00:05:12.940> picked<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.630> few<00:05:13.810> about<00:05:14.050> ten<00:05:14.260> minutes<00:05:14.440> ago

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
went picked a few about ten minutes ago

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.940 
went picked a few about ten minutes ago
so<00:05:15.550> I'm<00:05:15.610> going<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.850> pack<00:05:16.120> in<00:05:16.420> these<00:05:17.230> cucumbers

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
just going to stir this up a little bit

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
going to add this on top of the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.010 
going to add this on top of the
cucumbers<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.060> seasonings<00:05:49.570> I'm<00:05:49.810> just

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
cucumbers and the seasonings I'm just

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.050 
cucumbers and the seasonings I'm just
going<00:05:50.140> to<00:05:50.200> pour<00:05:50.410> in<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.680> brine<00:05:50.890> water<00:05:54.060> works

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
going to pour in the brine water works

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.100 
going to pour in the brine water works
slowly<00:05:55.450> so<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:55.870> doesn't<00:05:55.960> splash<00:05:59.640> alright<00:06:01.110> and

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
slowly so it doesn't splash alright and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.010 
slowly so it doesn't splash alright and
another<00:06:02.770> tip<00:06:03.130> is<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.430> make<00:06:03.820> sure<00:06:04.090> you<00:06:04.540> cut<00:06:04.840> off

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
another tip is to make sure you cut off

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.350 
another tip is to make sure you cut off
the<00:06:05.230> blossom<00:06:05.740> end<00:06:05.890> of<00:06:06.040> your<00:06:06.190> cucumber<00:06:06.730> this<00:06:07.180> is

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
the blossom end of your cucumber this is

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.810 
the blossom end of your cucumber this is
where<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.750> enzymes<00:06:08.200> are<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:09.190> will<00:06:09.430> start

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
where the enzymes are that will start

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.560 
where the enzymes are that will start
the<00:06:10.290> soggy<00:06:11.290> action<00:06:12.070> of<00:06:12.250> your<00:06:12.880> cucumbers<00:06:13.390> water

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
the soggy action of your cucumbers water

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.480 
the soggy action of your cucumbers water
fermenting<00:06:14.020> so<00:06:14.169> make<00:06:14.350> sure<00:06:14.380> you<00:06:14.620> always<00:06:14.830> slice

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
fermenting so make sure you always slice

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.880 
fermenting so make sure you always slice
off<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.790> blossom<00:06:16.480> end<00:06:16.660> then<00:06:17.590> I'm<00:06:17.680> going<00:06:17.830> to

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
off the blossom end then I'm going to

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.310 
off the blossom end then I'm going to
pack<00:06:18.070> the

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
pack the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.200 
pack the
because<00:06:18.620> I<00:06:18.680> have<00:06:18.770> a<00:06:18.830> little<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.670> little<00:06:20.030> bit<00:06:20.120> of

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
because I have a little a little bit of

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.880 
because I have a little a little bit of
salt<00:06:20.510> that<00:06:20.630> needs<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.960> be<00:06:21.050> mixed<00:06:21.230> in<00:06:21.500> on<00:06:21.740> the

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
salt that needs to be mixed in on the

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.460 
salt that needs to be mixed in on the
top<00:06:22.130> here<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:25.420> then<00:06:26.420> I'm<00:06:26.690> just<00:06:26.900> going<00:06:27.110> to<00:06:27.170> put

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
top here and then I'm just going to put

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.350 
top here and then I'm just going to put

the lid on you notice I've left about an

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.530 
the lid on you notice I've left about an
inch<00:06:29.570> at<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.810> top<00:06:31.090> and<00:06:32.090> now<00:06:32.240> I'm<00:06:32.360> going<00:06:32.480> to

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
inch at the top and now I'm going to

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.630 
inch at the top and now I'm going to
leave<00:06:32.810> this<00:06:33.170> on<00:06:33.410> the<00:06:33.470> counter<00:06:34.040> for<00:06:34.250> two<00:06:34.430> days

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
leave this on the counter for two days

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.750 
leave this on the counter for two days
at<00:06:35.420> room<00:06:35.480> temperature<00:06:36.200> after<00:06:37.010> two<00:06:37.250> days<00:06:37.460> I'm

they're ready and what you want to do at

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.800 
they're ready and what you want to do at
that<00:06:49.280> point<00:06:49.640> is<00:06:49.760> refrigerate<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.420> pickles

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
that point is refrigerate the pickles

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.690 
that point is refrigerate the pickles
and<00:06:50.990> they<00:06:51.110> will<00:06:51.260> last<00:06:51.500> for<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.830> number<00:06:52.310> of<00:06:52.430> weeks

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
and they will last for a number of weeks

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.730 
and they will last for a number of weeks
and<00:06:52.970> I<00:06:53.600> guarantee<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.110> they'll<00:06:54.290> be<00:06:54.380> used<00:06:54.560> up

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
and I guarantee you they'll be used up

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.530 
and I guarantee you they'll be used up
long<00:06:54.920> before<00:06:55.280> you<00:06:55.760> need<00:06:55.910> to<00:06:55.970> throw<00:06:56.240> them<00:06:56.420> out

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
long before you need to throw them out

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.840 
long before you need to throw them out
so<00:06:56.930> they'll<00:06:57.680> be<00:06:57.800> properly<00:06:58.280> fermented<00:06:58.730> that

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
so they'll be properly fermented that

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.120 
so they'll be properly fermented that
way<00:06:58.970> now<00:06:59.300> if<00:06:59.510> you<00:06:59.660> take<00:07:00.200> after<00:07:00.560> two<00:07:00.710> days<00:07:00.890> take
