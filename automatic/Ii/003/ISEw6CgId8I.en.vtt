00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
about having two textures I'm just doing

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
about having two textures I'm just doing
a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.420> bit<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.719> extra<00:00:45.899> texture<00:00:46.410> onto<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
a little bit of extra texture onto the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:01.689 
a little bit of extra texture onto the
eye<00:00:47.010> sorry<00:00:54.440> I'm<00:00:55.440> gonna<00:00:55.590> spray<00:00:55.770> away<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.129> okay

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.070 

it's<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.120> easier<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> clip<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's actually easier if you clip it in

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's actually easier if you clip it in
the<00:01:04.170> middle<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.850> then<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> whole<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> hair

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the middle and then the whole the hair

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
the middle and then the whole the hair
around<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.259> rope<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.770> curling<00:01:08.310> iron<00:01:08.430> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
around the rope the curling iron you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
around the rope the curling iron you
roll<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> arrow<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.470> first

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
roll it around the arrow so the first

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.050 
roll it around the arrow so the first
step<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.630> getting<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:19.020> curls<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.740> hair

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
step is getting these curls in your hair

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
step is getting these curls in your hair
the<00:01:21.060> second<00:01:21.420> part<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> sort<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> undoing<00:01:22.649> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the second part is sort of undoing the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
the second part is sort of undoing the
curls<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> skated<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:27.780> twisting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
curls so when I skated by twisting

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
curls so when I skated by twisting
around<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.500> finger<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.360> just

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
around my finger and then I kind of just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.919 
around my finger and then I kind of just
fluffed<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.640> worked<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.539> and

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
fluffed it up as i worked at down and

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.350 
fluffed it up as i worked at down and
then<00:01:34.140> after<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.970> I'm<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.179> to
