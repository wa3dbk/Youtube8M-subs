tastes like a Belgian stout yeah yeah
definitely<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.120> tell<00:02:44.329> that<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> was

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
definitely it's you can tell that it was

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.440 
definitely it's you can tell that it was
a<00:02:45.310> prompt<00:02:46.310> putting<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.549> yeast<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.879> little<00:02:46.909> to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
a prompt putting the yeast a little to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.150 
a prompt putting the yeast a little to
more<00:02:47.659> probably<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.769> also<00:02:48.950> why<00:02:49.129> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
more probably and that is also why you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680 
more probably and that is also why you
would<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.459> some<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.670> Belgian<00:02:50.180> flavors

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
would get some of that Belgian flavors

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.640 
would get some of that Belgian flavors
out<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.110> right

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
out of it right

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.410 
out of it right
definitely<00:02:52.280> not<00:02:52.370> wrong<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.910> think<00:02:53.209> there's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
definitely not wrong I think there's

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
definitely not wrong I think there's
almost<00:02:53.510> birds<00:02:53.870> discretion<00:02:54.440> for<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.739> that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
almost birds discretion for that that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.069 
almost birds discretion for that that
you<00:02:55.250> can<00:02:55.430> do<00:02:55.670> kind<00:02:55.849> of<00:02:55.940> whatever<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.420> want<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
you can do kind of whatever you want and

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.420 
you can do kind of whatever you want and
that's<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.379> flavor<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.950> for<00:02:58.160> for

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that's the flavor you're going for for

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.210 
that's the flavor you're going for for
us<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.819> mean<00:02:58.940> it's<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.480> think<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.440> what<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.739> is

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
us I mean it's I think it is what it is

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.849 
us I mean it's I think it is what it is
yeah<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.970> not<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:03.170> wouldn't<00:03:03.500> say<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.709> bad

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
yeah it's not I I wouldn't say it's bad

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.339 
yeah it's not I I wouldn't say it's bad
it's<00:03:04.129> awesome<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.879> front<00:03:05.150> though<00:03:05.299> it's<00:03:05.540> yeah

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
it's awesome up front though it's yeah

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.619 
it's awesome up front though it's yeah
definitely<00:03:06.799> a<00:03:06.829> Belgian<00:03:07.549> drinkin<00:03:08.150> stout<00:03:08.480> it

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
definitely a Belgian drinkin stout it

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.809 
definitely a Belgian drinkin stout it
has<00:03:08.780> some<00:03:09.019> dark<00:03:09.230> fruit<00:03:09.470> maybe<00:03:09.680> some<00:03:09.890> banana<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
has some dark fruit maybe some banana it

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.099 
has some dark fruit maybe some banana it
works<00:03:10.970> his<00:03:11.120> way<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.480> back<00:03:11.599> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.780> palate

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
works his way to the back of the palate

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.819 
works his way to the back of the palate
chocolate<00:03:12.799> coffee<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.930> then<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.319> residual

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
chocolate coffee and then as a residual

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:23.259 
chocolate coffee and then as a residual
you<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.190> oak<00:03:16.900> yeah<00:03:17.900> really<00:03:22.239> yeah<00:03:23.239> I

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
you get that oak yeah really yeah I

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.120 
you get that oak yeah really yeah I
think<00:03:23.389> it's<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.599> little<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.079> upfront<00:03:24.319> but

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
think it's a little you see upfront but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.740 
think it's a little you see upfront but
when<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.370> finishes<00:03:25.669> it<00:03:26.000> totally<00:03:26.419> blends

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
when it finishes it totally blends

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.690 
when it finishes it totally blends
together<00:03:26.989> yeah<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.799> think<00:03:28.010> without<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.549> oak

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
together yeah I think without the oak

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.750 
together yeah I think without the oak
barrel<00:03:29.470> yeah<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.889> would<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.370> missing

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
barrel yeah it would be missing

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.099 
barrel yeah it would be missing
something<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.239> oak<00:03:32.389> on<00:03:32.569> this<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.959> really

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
something with the oak on this it really

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.039 
something with the oak on this it really
does<00:03:33.230> employ<00:03:33.590> those<00:03:33.709> before<00:03:34.040> Yeah<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:35.510> yeah

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
does employ those before Yeah right yeah

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.860 
does employ those before Yeah right yeah
it's<00:03:36.500> kind<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.799> almost<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.250> mistake<00:03:37.870> too

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
it's kind of almost like a mistake too

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.080 
it's kind of almost like a mistake too
with<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.440> yeast<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.579> Braille<00:03:40.760> kind

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
with the yeast and then the Braille kind

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.300 
with the yeast and then the Braille kind
of<00:03:41.209> blends<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:41.810> in<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.109> makes<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.440> even<00:03:43.160> better

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
of blends it in it makes it even better

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.400 
of blends it in it makes it even better
a<00:03:43.549> Brewer<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:43.940> wrote<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.389> Ben<00:03:44.540> if<00:03:44.840> everything

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
always is like nothing is like a perfect

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.390 
always is like nothing is like a perfect
game

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
game

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.420 
game
right<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.239> art<00:03:54.760> yeah<00:03:55.760> it's<00:03:56.090> really<00:03:56.299> nice

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
right it's art yeah it's really nice

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.740 
right it's art yeah it's really nice
it's<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:58.639> as<00:03:58.760> viscous<00:03:59.060> as<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.389> expected

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
it's not as viscous as I expected

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.270 
it's not as viscous as I expected
expectation<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.319> you're<00:04:00.470> really<00:04:00.889> thick

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
expectation if you're really thick

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.509 
expectation if you're really thick
through<00:04:01.910> which<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.620> really<00:04:03.950> full-bodied

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
through which it is really full-bodied

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.449 
through which it is really full-bodied
but<00:04:04.549> it's<00:04:04.879> not<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.870> I'm<00:04:06.470> no<00:04:06.650> shake<00:04:06.919> right<00:04:07.250> if

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
but it's not like I'm no shake right if

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.680 
but it's not like I'm no shake right if
we<00:04:07.579> were<00:04:07.609> gonna<00:04:07.760> do<00:04:07.879> this<00:04:07.970> again<00:04:08.120> for<00:04:08.599> that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
we were gonna do this again for that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.229 
we were gonna do this again for that
I'll<00:04:08.930> definitely<00:04:09.379> say<00:04:10.340> let's<00:04:10.819> not<00:04:10.910> in

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
I'll definitely say let's not in

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.119 
I'll definitely say let's not in
something<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:11.720> gonna<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.109> flake<00:04:12.739> barley

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
something that's gonna like flake barley

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.879 
something that's gonna like flake barley
or<00:04:13.160> flaked<00:04:13.489> oats<00:04:13.609> even<00:04:14.150> maybe<00:04:15.049> multo<00:04:15.440> dextran

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
or flaked oats even maybe multo dextran

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.860 
or flaked oats even maybe multo dextran
for<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.190> extract<00:04:16.609> just<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
for the extract just to get so it's a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.699 
for the extract just to get so it's a
little<00:04:18.109> bit<00:04:18.289> thicker

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
little bit thicker

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.039 
little bit thicker
yeah<00:04:19.099> a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.699> bit<00:04:19.729> more<00:04:19.970> mouthfeel<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:20.630> it

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
yeah a little bit more mouthfeel so it

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.420 
yeah a little bit more mouthfeel so it
really<00:04:21.260> does<00:04:21.410> on<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.709> end<00:04:21.859> like<00:04:22.099> have<00:04:22.400> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
really does on the end like have a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.730 
really does on the end like have a
little<00:04:22.550> thin<00:04:22.940> flavor<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.449> it<00:04:23.479> right<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.710> I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
little thin flavor to it right but I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.140 
little thin flavor to it right but I
think<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:24.950> almost<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.370> lends<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.760> back<00:04:25.969> to

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
think it almost that lends it back to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.310 
think it almost that lends it back to
that<00:04:26.300> Belgian<00:04:26.780> sort<00:04:27.140> of

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
that Belgian sort of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.230 
that Belgian sort of
interesting<00:04:29.320> brew<00:04:29.650> but<00:04:30.550> yeah<00:04:30.669> I'm<00:04:30.880> really

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
interesting brew but yeah I'm really

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.629 
interesting brew but yeah I'm really
glad<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:31.840> went<00:04:32.020> through<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.229> barrel

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
glad this went through the barrel

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.900 
glad this went through the barrel
because<00:04:34.889> yeah<00:04:35.889> I<00:04:35.919> just<00:04:36.250> feel<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.520> blended

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
because yeah I just feel like it blended

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.219 
because yeah I just feel like it blended
everything<00:04:37.210> together<00:04:37.330> made<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> really

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
everything together made a really

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.050 
everything together made a really
complex<00:04:38.590> brew<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.889> we<00:04:39.550> probably<00:04:39.790> wouldn't

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
complex brew that we probably wouldn't

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.530 
complex brew that we probably wouldn't
have<00:04:40.210> had<00:04:41.160> without<00:04:42.160> going<00:04:42.520> that<00:04:43.030> direction<00:04:43.150> I

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
have had without going that direction I

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.600 
have had without going that direction I
might<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.530> even<00:04:44.650> ruined<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.190> brew<00:04:45.370> if<00:04:45.520> it

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
might have even ruined the brew if it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.430 
might have even ruined the brew if it
didn't<00:04:45.790> go<00:04:45.910> through<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.090> barrel<00:04:46.419> right<00:04:47.080> but

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
didn't go through the barrel right but

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.360 
didn't go through the barrel right but
and<00:04:47.860> then<00:04:48.040> it's<00:04:48.760> awesome<00:04:49.800> really<00:04:50.800> nice<00:04:51.040> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and then it's awesome really nice the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.570 
and then it's awesome really nice the
recipe<00:04:51.850> will<00:04:52.660> be<00:04:52.690> in<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.350> info<00:04:53.680> check<00:04:54.340> out<00:04:54.460> the

last two videos we did we did the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.620 
last two videos we did we did the
bottling<00:04:56.530> on<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.979> video<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.669> all<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:57.940> okjung

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630

nice<00:05:05.020> recipe<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.800> think<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:07.210> barrel<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:07.870> our

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
nice recipe I think the barrel in our

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.279 
nice recipe I think the barrel in our
case<00:05:08.500> was<00:05:08.800> definitely<00:05:09.160> imperative<00:05:09.699> so<00:05:10.289> for

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
case was definitely imperative so for

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.529 
case was definitely imperative so for
sure<00:05:11.500> look<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.130> deep<00:05:12.310> south<00:05:12.580> if<00:05:12.910> you're

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
sure look the deep south if you're

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.409
