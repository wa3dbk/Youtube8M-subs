good time I put on top all right time is
of<00:05:46.639> the<00:05:46.669> essence<00:05:47.150> as<00:05:47.389> soon<00:05:47.720> as<00:05:47.810> we<00:05:47.990> take<00:05:48.169> this

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
of the essence as soon as we take this

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.870 
of the essence as soon as we take this
off<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:49.550> sea<00:05:49.960> we<00:05:50.960> got<00:05:51.110> for<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.590> on<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.130> then<00:05:52.159> we

because<00:05:55.639> this<00:05:56.000> will<00:05:56.180> harden<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:57.860> let's<00:05:58.099> stir

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
because this will harden so let's stir

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.249 
because this will harden so let's stir
it<00:05:58.669> just<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.180> get<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.419> bubbles<00:05:59.599> down<00:05:59.930> a<00:05:59.960> little
