00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.639
 I 'm laughing because now here at home 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.880
 they laugh at me with the business of 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.800
 worse we will continue with the peyotes in 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.210
 this opportunity we are going to work the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.609
 tubular peyote that is very similar to 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.850
 all the other piles but it's a tube 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.710
 and to do the little tubular test what 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.580
 that we're going to need a tube that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.350
 you choose a little bottle a cone of 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.940
 toilet paper what you have to 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.330
 hand that is a tube and the tubular peyote 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.720
 it works in beauty of peace can be 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.479
 do diagram is very nice it serves to 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.240
 be short for lillo cut the che 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:00.890
 sports needles 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.220
 of everything to line a lighter in order 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.950
 a lot of gadgets can be 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.110
 erase with the brightness of your flying it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.200
 you can make diagrams you can make figures 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.960
 what you always in beauty of peace 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.510
 then let's start now with 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.910
 our beautiful peace and they will need 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 the jewelery needle the thread for 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.930
 costume jewelry is 15 020 according to the thickness 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:30.650
 of the accounts they have and then we go 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.520
 to set the amount of account that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.420
 encompass the perimeter of our tube 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:43.050
 now we start with the tubular video 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 the tubular peyote as its name says 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:53.430
 is to make a tube we are always going to have 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.190
 a guide that leads us to do this 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.150
 tubular peyote in this case the sample 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 what are we going to do this pencil 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.690
 it can be thicker it can be more 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.590
 thin can be whatever for example 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:15.300
 It takes a lot to make chopsticks 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.110
 the tubes of the towel does not go to paper 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.810
 kitchen that they call it is very good and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.170
 nice jobs are left 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.340
 do diagram there is no pattern 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.340
 determined because the only thing that demands 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:44.330
 but you tubular is to be in even number 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 it can be 10 12 14 16 18 20 and so on 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 etcetera etcetera according to the radius of the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.560
 measure the circumference you have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.560
 our pipe is the amount of number if 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.580
 so that to give 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.069
 the full circumference does not matter 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.640
 that is a few millimeters more loose 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:15.200
 but it has to go in even number can not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.610
 go in odd already good here I have to 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.340
 this is this sample that we are going to do 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:28.930
 I have put 20 accounts 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:33.010
 in my thread I am occupying a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:39.670
 long jewelery needle I'm occupying 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.670
 a nylon thread number 0 20 already I 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.030
 allows the account if they are more accounts 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.410
 finite would have to be a 0 15 well 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.100
 here I have my circumference given with 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.010
 20 account surpassed 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.600
 with my needle you count 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.390
 exceed the amount that you 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.930
 consider inconvenient the idea is the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.320
 firmness to work do not forget to be 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.010
 generous in the tail they leave because 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.930
 it is always useful for some termination 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.750
 at the last moment that arise 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:26.030
 well I have here already my accounts 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.280
 with our thread about past and beginning 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.150
 to work the tubular peyote is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:39.139
 exactly like the common peyote and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:44.050
 current that we work I have my thread 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:49.389
 of thread in that account advanced one 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.389
 I introduce needle and sack 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.889
 again I take my account I advance a 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.879
 account 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.050
 I pass the needle through the next account and 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:08.289
 I continue in principle you are going to see 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.770
 a job that has no form does not have 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.530
 nothing but we're going to see it 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.210
 my needle and my thread come out on account 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.009
 previous one advanced 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.980
 income in the following account 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:31.240
 and stilts and so on until completing 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:37.780
 the turn in the last account we have 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:41.540
 of the 20 pair accounts of our fabric 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.020
 circular or tula is circular and flat east 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.139
 is your ball because for a tube 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:53.729
 well I have reached the last account of my 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.729
 peyote and advanced one more account 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:02.260
 and I start 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:08.320
 to do my second round of peyote 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:11.820
 now where there is an account I put next 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.740
 my other account and where there are two accounts 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:20.590
 I enter my needle for her 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:26.930
 and so I'm completing the whole circle 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:30.860
 again until I got where I started and 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.650
 so will this continue successively if 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.650
 you want to make a figure or 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:41.660
 look for a figure on the internet there are many 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:45.650
 figures to carry lighters like 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.449
 pencil holders there are precious figures 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.509
 they can do jobs really 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.900
 wonderful the only care he has 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:57.620
 to have is to notice there are jobs with 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:01.340
 peyote odd but it all depends on the 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.569
 drawing that you bring and how to do it if 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:08.270
 do open could serve odd but 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:12.720
 they have to match the 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:15.400
 endings to later join it if it is 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:20.590
 tubular that is being made as a 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:25.090
 little tube and there yes it has to be part is 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:28.500
 the technique of tubular peyote see you 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.500
 in a next tutorial
