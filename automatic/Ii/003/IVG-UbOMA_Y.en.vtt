00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 the guests had a long journey to Plus Wehrendorf behind them 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.569
 wanted on the fifth matchday 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:16.109
 against the local handball players competed the HSG varel-friesland was a guest 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.510
 in the local sports hall 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.510
 in the place of the giant in Kreuztal 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.410
 The home team of coach Schaaf after the sign proudly after secretly 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.909
 the last won game 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.560
 in Valencia Arfmann won there with 33 to 31 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.080
 today with the necessary self-confidence and also in the first four 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.960
 play 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.810
 the handball players of TuS Ferndorf have a more positive balance a draw 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.130
 a defeat but in the last two play on two victories entirely in the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.930
 Unlike the HSG varel-friesland 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.809
 she has one of the art cyclists this season defeating a win 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.900
 then another defeat 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.220
 and in the last game there was again a victory against the Ahlen SG 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.710
 the guests as relegated from the second German handball league streets today 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.750
 but very confident and confident 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.610
 and thus presented the TuS Derendorf again and again problems 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.630
 somehow the red thread was missing in the local handball players 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.310
 play 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.649
 but in the first 15 to 20 minutes Marseille still a right 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.930
 balanced game 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.830
 after 22 played 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.340
 Flagships holiday village with only one hit back 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.370
 against the guests, however, it was bitter and by the minute 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.440
 minute 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.200
 a strong goalkeeper of the guests left little hits of the bus 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.290
 Berndorf too 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.180
 it may also lie here and there the Flück at the end 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.170
 and Stars Love reacted the chips with Rainer Auszeit 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.799
 the part of but little and so were the domestic handball players have 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.950
 with five goals back to halftime break 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.130
 and that works as usual the tag actively on the sidelines 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.849
 makes his anger because of his anger 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.590
 but he as well as the nearly 1000 spectators in the sports hall at the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.649
 Steller meadow 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.139
 should see in the second half that it was not much better 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.769
 and with the TuS remote village 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.010
 the guests left 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.359
 little hit the leading role too 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:29.129
 and on the other hand, that has always been the last in the election 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.279
 trading course 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.640
 the TuS remote village 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.599
 loses Obama end 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.660
 Egeln 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.159
 the guests with 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.619
 to 23 to the 33 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.659
 and of course this is not a good start for us here from victories very much 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.559
 Lazy at TuS remote village 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.730
 but the change they made it to the guests 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.319
 often far too easy to score goals 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.289
 the seismometers and three away games and we are at the next home game 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.039
 again with us and bars 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.779
 at the 29th cents tenth 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.859
 Fritsch the TuS Ferndorf sleep on the floor here in the 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.280
 domestic stables meadow 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.299
 and blessing for vs will broadcast the game live and now 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.529
 the strikers did not play that way 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.309
 at the Wasserwacht 33 23 they lost the game 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.539
 it was not a good game we had been struggling from the start 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.629
 and in defense 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.079
 to simple goals percent have serve and volley 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.779
 in one-on-one situations 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.999
 that he often lost 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.279
 in the attack did not let either 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.279
 Advertisers, in particular, want to use it 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.129
 Klopsch LG has on 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.019
 Anyone could have tried everything 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.999
 Solon monsters became 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.439
 played so heavily against Valencia monkeys in the last game last week 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.999
 how can it be there that one 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.999
 yes, he has the game 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.869
 the area is all open 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.889
 Qatar has worked a lot but also stood well in the defense October 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.699
 works the best aroma start had to work while he pats well then plays 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.029
 he will reach the front 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.989
 there you make ice cap Torgelow 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.019
 A Dedesdorf world does not get you do not have to throw forward 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.169
 and 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.169
 yes in the game against Ferrer win 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.399
 Of course, then, for the first time, we will also have to score a lot for ourselves 

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.759
 Much better then gets 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.339
 Next week it will be against Nijmegen what he says there again planned 

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.749
 victory 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:36.650
 Naturally 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.650
 SID always hope for every game 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.009
 where each game is preparing as well as possible 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.129
 and so 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.969
 Herod's sedan to defeat 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.009
 they are dolls 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.210
 Worm made mistakes how to look back the mistakes on Easter Sunday evening where 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.020
 you can avoid the mistakes 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.300
 and percent 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.669
 yes, there we stay again on the good 4 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.629
 that the whole again have to be replaced at first already and a lot 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.339
 Luck next round thinks 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.669
 he destroys 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.210
 his first 23 lost the fields commentary on the game or off 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:14.059
 that's hard but the goal is not counted anymore 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.940
 in my job here the mast will be as bad as it still worries her 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.259
 Books yet 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.509
 Game to comment against but better that we had to accept 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.819
 Percent above which the singer will quickly survive police work 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.809
 push the elections 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.029
 Bessin attacks given October was safe 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.830
 and also deserves to win more but Tim responds one second to the tip of the ski 

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:38.719
 give everything 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.210
 also at APA 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.919
 Audials player circle we have on the squadrons Hegau predecessor he has 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.059
 shot by Zerlett 11 with the left 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:49.680
 Adam's Ricercar 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.520
 Wunsiedel dramatic accident unable to correct here 6 0-defense 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.260
 Means to find and so we will be well our know-how question whether we 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.159
 for any help they will happily count on afterwards 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.849
 and Poldi the city will still be satisfied everyone will only have with Senta Berger 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:05.520
 because 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.699
 but we were already getting so much milk I would be glad he was back 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.389
 These over the team should be so weak after players 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.110
 back one has one last week 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.110
 Super game seen I think how can it be that people caused the performance 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.950
 yes that happened in Hamburg was in court 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.710
 It's hard and I have to say that it's too much right now 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.710
 Ott instructed leadership elite to promote Michelle 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.229
 Lord of the countless must definite correct game to her and who from today 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.930
 Fever 38 dead actually did not play at all I tried even day 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.809
 to track down with 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:45.249
 We've already gotten old 10 15 minutes and lost as they fight back 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.039
 Ulrich Lau was Indian of Libra 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.039
 of our system 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.680
 Photo Marc Bullet »and maybe three four goals made that adults 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680
 I mean 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.369
 six goals 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:01.180
 next week as against 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.840
 what are they expecting there or from the team and why they are the team? 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.369
 on 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:07.169
 she has to do that herself 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.919
 AR 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:14.319
 such games happen anyway has always been for uncomfortable opponents a4 and 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.549
 yes then investors with 13 2 million at home 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.409
 from there 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.459
 hopefully one will win the tough game but we have 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.229
 Massa 3 away games 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.879
 Monday is a holiday we will not be no honest that certain thought you like 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:35.189
