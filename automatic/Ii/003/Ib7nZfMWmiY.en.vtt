aerobic exercise is really important for
aging<00:01:17.400> pets<00:01:17.840> also<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.140> important<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> note

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
aging pets also it's important to note

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
aging pets also it's important to note
that<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.939> want<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.210> pets<00:01:21.540> heart<00:01:21.869> rate<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> be

that you want your pets heart rate to be

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.219 
that you want your pets heart rate to be

elevated consistently working up to 20
minutes<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.619> let's<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.400> an

minutes so let's say that you have an

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
minutes so let's say that you have an
older<00:01:26.759> pet<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.810> walk<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.259> end<00:01:28.500> of

older pet that will walk to the end of
the<00:01:28.710> block<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.189> no<00:01:29.340> further<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.450> slowly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the block but no further you can slowly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
the block but no further you can slowly
literally<00:01:31.470> sometimes<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.579> yard<00:01:33.090> or

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
literally sometimes it's even a yard or

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.850 
literally sometimes it's even a yard or
two<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.780> adding<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> distance

two that you're adding to the distance

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.319 
two that you're adding to the distance
that<00:01:35.070> you'll<00:01:35.189> walk<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> week's<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:35.970> and

that you'll walk in a week's time and
next<00:01:36.479> week<00:01:36.720> you'll<00:01:36.900> walk<00:01:37.140> half<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> block<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
next week you'll walk half a block more

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
next week you'll walk half a block more
on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> week<00:01:38.400> after<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.820> you'll<00:01:39.060> walk<00:01:39.509> half

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
on the week after that you'll walk half

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
on the week after that you'll walk half
a<00:01:39.780> block<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.280> slowly

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a block more but you're slowly

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600 
a block more but you're slowly
increasing<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.780> pets<00:01:43.040> ability<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.340> move

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

painful or too debilitated to actually

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.010 
painful or too debilitated to actually
walk<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.650> ask<00:03:52.830> your<00:03:53.010> veterinarian<00:03:53.580> about

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
hydrotherapy my favorite form of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.920 
hydrotherapy my favorite form of
exercise<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:56.940> pets<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.270> actually<00:03:57.630> swimming

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
exercise for pets is actually swimming

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.870 
exercise for pets is actually swimming
swimming<00:03:58.470> allows<00:03:58.890> pets<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.400> weightless

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
swimming allows pets to be weightless

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.150 
swimming allows pets to be weightless
and<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.660> they're<00:04:01.020> able<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.560> complete<00:04:01.950> range

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
and so they're able to do complete range

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.710 
and so they're able to do complete range
of<00:04:02.340> motion<00:04:02.760> they're<00:04:02.910> not<00:04:03.060> having<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.510> bear

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
of motion they're not having to bear

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.030 
of motion they're not having to bear
their<00:04:03.930> own<00:04:03.990> body<00:04:04.260> weight<00:04:04.470> which<00:04:04.680> can<00:04:04.710> be<00:04:05.010> a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
their own body weight which can be a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.590 
their own body weight which can be a
tremendous<00:04:05.550> load<00:04:05.730> let's<00:04:06.000> say<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.330> an<00:04:06.420> 80

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
tremendous load let's say for an 80

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.570 
tremendous load let's say for an 80
pound<00:04:06.870> Doberman<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> lot<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:08.100> body<00:04:08.340> weight

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
pound Doberman it's a lot of body weight

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.580 
pound Doberman it's a lot of body weight
if<00:04:08.850> she<00:04:09.210> or<00:04:09.330> he's<00:04:09.540> got<00:04:09.810> really<00:04:10.080> tender<00:04:10.410> knees

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
if she or he's got really tender knees

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.890 
if she or he's got really tender knees
so<00:04:11.430> swimming<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:11.970> actually<00:04:12.390> one<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> very

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
so swimming is actually one of the very

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.270 
so swimming is actually one of the very
best<00:04:13.110> ways<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.410> get<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.710> completely

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
best ways to get a completely

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
best ways to get a completely
debilitated<00:04:15.090> pet<00:04:15.330> up<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.840> their<00:04:15.990> feet

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
debilitated pet up and on their feet

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.349 
debilitated pet up and on their feet

to<00:04:44.130> know<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:44.580> we<00:04:44.700> don't<00:04:44.880> do<00:04:45.030> anything<00:04:45.270> to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
to know that if we don't do anything to

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.840 
to know that if we don't do anything to
slow<00:04:46.140> down<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.620> degenerative<00:04:47.070> process<00:04:47.610> it

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
slow down that degenerative process it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.750 
slow down that degenerative process it
happens<00:04:48.860> exponentially<00:04:49.860> as<00:04:50.040> pets<00:04:50.310> age<00:04:50.490> so

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
happens exponentially as pets age so

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760 
happens exponentially as pets age so
their<00:04:51.030> bodies<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.690> generate<00:04:52.080> faster<00:04:52.380> the

their bodies to generate faster the
older<00:04:53.040> they<00:04:53.190> get<00:04:53.400> which<00:04:53.610> means<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.030> harder<00:04:54.390> we

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
older they get which means the harder we

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.360
