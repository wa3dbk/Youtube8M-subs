driving was one of the things that

on the road I realized it really wasn't
that<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.719> from<00:00:16.020> driving<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> u.s.

can't do that here in Germany on a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
can't do that here in Germany on a
directional<00:01:06.750> sign<00:01:06.990> it'll<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.619> save<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
directional sign it'll just save the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
directional sign it'll just save the
city<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> road<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
city that that road will take you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
city that that road will take you
towards<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
towards but if you don't know that that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
towards but if you don't know that that
city<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> north<00:01:12.630> south<00:01:12.689> east<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.170> west<00:01:13.229> then

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
city is north south east or west then

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
city is north south east or west then
you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.280> idea<00:01:14.490> where<00:01:14.670> you're<00:01:14.760> going

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you have no idea where you're going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030 
you have no idea where you're going
that's<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.689> reason<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> GPS<00:01:16.409> comes<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> handy

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's one reason a GPS comes in handy

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
that's one reason a GPS comes in handy
because<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.360> entire

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
because I don't have the entire

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
because I don't have the entire
geography<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.560> Germany<00:01:19.950> memorized<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.520> don't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
geography of Germany memorized I don't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
geography of Germany memorized I don't
know<00:01:20.850> exactly<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.630> direction<00:01:22.170> every<00:01:22.619> city

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
know exactly which direction every city

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
know exactly which direction every city
I<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> sign<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.060> located<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.170> next

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I see on a sign is located the next

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.510 
I see on a sign is located the next
basic<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.040> should<00:01:26.189> probably<00:01:26.340> talk

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
basic thing we should probably talk

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
basic thing we should probably talk
about<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.880> getting<00:01:27.060> gas<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.750> Germany<00:01:28.170> getting

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
about is getting gas in Germany getting

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
about is getting gas in Germany getting
gas<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> very<00:01:29.759> similar<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> getting<00:01:30.299> gas

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
gas here is very similar to getting gas

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
gas here is very similar to getting gas
in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> States<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> mean<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:31.799> hardly<00:01:31.979> any

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
in the States I mean there's hardly any

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
in the States I mean there's hardly any
differences<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.960> pump<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
differences you get out you pump it you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.440 
differences you get out you pump it you
pay<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> drill

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
pay you know the drill

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.240 
pay you know the drill
most<00:01:36.630> gas<00:01:36.869> stations<00:01:36.900> also<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.710> credit<00:01:37.979> cards

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
most gas stations also take credit cards

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
most gas stations also take credit cards
so<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.790> something<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.270> need

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
so that's not something you really need

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
so that's not something you really need
to<00:01:39.780> worry<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.110> there's<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.530> ATMs<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.340> most

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to worry about there's also ATMs in most

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
to worry about there's also ATMs in most
gas<00:01:41.729> stations<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:42.299> well<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> case<00:01:43.020> they

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
gas stations as well just in case they

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.569 
gas stations as well just in case they
don't<00:01:43.409> take<00:01:43.680> credit<00:01:43.829> cards<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> thing<00:01:44.549> about

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
don't take credit cards the thing about

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
don't take credit cards the thing about
German<00:01:45.060> gas<00:01:45.240> stations<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.500> unless

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
German gas stations is that unless

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
German gas stations is that unless
they're<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> major<00:01:47.490> highway<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.570> a

high-traffic area they're probably not

going to be open that late

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
going to be open that late
also<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.290> aware<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.590> gas<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.520> expensive

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
also be aware that gas is very expensive

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
also be aware that gas is very expensive
here<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.840> now<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.409> today<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.399> average

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
here right now like today the average

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
gas price for regular unleaded gas is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.170 
gas price for regular unleaded gas is
about<00:02:00.060> 160<00:02:00.899> euro<00:02:01.229> per<00:02:01.560> liter<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.520> translates

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
about 160 euro per liter that translates

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
about 160 euro per liter that translates
to<00:02:03.299> about<00:02:03.659> seven<00:02:04.110> dollars<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> fifty<00:02:04.619> cents<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
to about seven dollars and fifty cents a

to about seven dollars and fifty cents a
gallon<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> steep<00:02:06.180> okay<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:06.930> that's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
gallon kind of steep okay so that's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
gallon kind of steep okay so that's
enough<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> basics<00:02:07.799> let's<00:02:08.310> move<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
enough of the basics let's move on to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
enough of the basics let's move on to
the<00:02:09.539> Autobahn<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.709> Autobahn<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> probably

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the Autobahn the Autobahn is probably

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.070 
the Autobahn the Autobahn is probably
what<00:02:11.879> most<00:02:11.910> people<00:02:12.390> think<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.660> when<00:02:12.840> they

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
what most people think about when they

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.550 
what most people think about when they
think<00:02:13.110> about

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
think about

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
think about
driving<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.920> Germany<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.489> my<00:02:14.790> mind<00:02:15.060> before<00:02:15.390> we

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
driving in Germany in my mind before we

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
driving in Germany in my mind before we
moved<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.140> had<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.620> weird<00:02:16.950> mental<00:02:17.310> image

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
moved here I had this weird mental image

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.070 
moved here I had this weird mental image
of<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> Autobahn<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.450> thought<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:18.930> just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
of the Autobahn I thought it was just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.160 
of the Autobahn I thought it was just
one<00:02:19.260> road<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.640> big<00:02:20.940> road<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.870> lots<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
one road just one big road with lots of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.660 
one road just one big road with lots of
lanes<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.800> could<00:02:23.069> just<00:02:23.190> drive<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.489> fast

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
lanes and you could just drive as fast

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.370 
lanes and you could just drive as fast
as<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.209> no<00:02:24.300> speed<00:02:24.599> on<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.200> was

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
as you want to no speed on it that was

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.839 
as you want to no speed on it that was
exactly<00:02:25.739> what<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.069> thought<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> Autobahn<00:02:26.670> was

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
exactly what I thought the Autobahn was

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.430 
exactly what I thought the Autobahn was
I<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.480> know<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.840> that's<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.080> common

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
I don't know if that's a common

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.740 
I don't know if that's a common
misconception<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.430> don't<00:02:30.150> know<00:02:30.239> even<00:02:30.480> where<00:02:30.690> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
misconception I don't know even where I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.809 
misconception I don't know even where I
got<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.319> from<00:02:31.530> where<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.830> heard<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.340> but

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
got that from where I heard that but

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.699 
got that from where I heard that but
that's<00:02:33.120> what<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.330> thought<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.750> reality<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
that's what I thought in reality the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.680 
that's what I thought in reality the
Autobahn<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.489> just<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.060> system<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
Autobahn is just the system of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.600 
Autobahn is just the system of
interstate<00:02:37.290> highways<00:02:37.650> here<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
interstate highways here there are a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.370 
interstate highways here there are a
bunch<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.060> autobahns<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.080> north

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
bunch of autobahns and they go north

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
bunch of autobahns and they go north
south<00:02:40.620> east<00:02:40.950> west<00:02:41.069> all<00:02:41.489> over<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.849> place<00:02:42.060> and

80<00:02:54.150> miles<00:02:54.510> per<00:02:54.690> hour<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.410> still<00:02:55.739> pretty

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
80 miles per hour so it's still pretty

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.949 
80 miles per hour so it's still pretty
dang<00:02:56.250> fast<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:57.150> would<00:02:57.299> think<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.569> with<00:02:57.750> no

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
dang fast you would think that with no

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.839 
dang fast you would think that with no
speed<00:02:58.230> limit<00:02:58.560> or<00:02:58.769> in<00:02:59.069> some<00:02:59.250> cases<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.610> high

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
speed limit or in some cases a high

speed<00:03:00.209> limit<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> Autobahn<00:03:01.080> would<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.560> a

speed limit the Autobahn would have a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.050 
speed limit the Autobahn would have a
lot<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.890> accidents<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.880> not

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
lot of accidents but that's really not

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
lot of accidents but that's really not
the<00:03:03.209> case<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.630> accident<00:03:04.110> rate<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
the case the accident rate here is

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.309 
the case the accident rate here is
relatively<00:03:05.190> low<00:03:05.580> because<00:03:06.019> people<00:03:07.019> here<00:03:07.200> know

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
relatively low because people here know

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.780 
relatively low because people here know
how<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.470> drive<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.280> will<00:03:08.430> notice<00:03:08.760> that
