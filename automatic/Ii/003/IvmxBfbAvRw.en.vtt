00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.669
 hi to all these sharks meet again 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.719
 for a new video on gta online 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.700
 is today a race a little 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.200
 anything like the last time we 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.070
 ends up with smart but except that 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 there was the choice with others 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.550
 cars and people if they did not 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.140
 watch out for the cars stage 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.280
 have not taken the smart and they are not going 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.700
 win so I think there is only one 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.810
 guy who took a mini and not a 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.590
 smart so we'll see what's up 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.769
 give 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.030
 there we have the keys is so we can get 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.170
 touch and push yourself and I will 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.140
 reminds you that you do not really need 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.809
 push on the joystick with that because 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.070
 that if not that by you already see they 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.870
 are they all they wanted to take 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.850
 a big turn and result it does not work 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.339
 so you just have to turn a little bit 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.559
 right into the curb a little bit 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.229
 it's better to do nothing that sticks to me 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.699
 ass on the other hand I have a lot of 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.140
 the excellent not bad we will try to 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.969
 see what it's going to give 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.120
 fucking we go hand in hand this is the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.680
 not by you except you it is not there that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.229
 times the fucking aces I lose to the whore I 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.140
 am 4th what the guys are gonna do they have 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.700
 accelerated like bullets we will try 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.729
 to block it a bit if the front is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 so here it is it does not look but 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.030
 it's pretty technical actually these 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.770
 small cars the info not see 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 look at the pump at this past easily 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.180
 in front because guys are accelerating too much 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.149
 where is the fair on the thing it's really 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.609
 pretty impressive that but it puts some 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.750
 spice up a bit in the race 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.340
 I hope you like these little ones 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.609
 races there nice enough do not hesitate to 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.439
 come 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.899
 what do you think about them in 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.070
 comments below you would do me a 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.140
 pleasure to answer them 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.479
 like every time so we took the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.979
 first position and have tried to 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.320
 girls and first of all what this happens 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.969
 behind pretty quickly and that's it 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.450
 it takes experience to drive a 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.729
 slope so I hope my little ones 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.659
 tips you liked and on that I you 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.740

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.740

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.310
