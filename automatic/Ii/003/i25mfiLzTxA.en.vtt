00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello dear friends yourself star 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 line and today in this video tutorial I 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 I would like to show you how to change 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.940
 coding strength of site 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
 but first let's see what 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 in general this and this is our site here 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 we will see that we have some kind of cracks 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 very incomprehensible nothing is visible only 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.510
 we understand the news that we write on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.310
 Russian language 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 everything else is expressed here in such a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.609
 granddaughters 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 we can not see anything and jumped off 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 pattern then it doesn't matter it can be easily 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 to fix 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.180
 For years, besides herself, the program is over 5 + + 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.010
 and even straight arms 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.219
 this template I can throw you a link to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 Well, you can also use it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.539
 take a walk and on these he is decent good 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 such a pattern 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.379
 this is a template for aphids means standing folder 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.949
 new and here we have to load our 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.910
 go template means only our client 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.930
 and go to our folder and copy our 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.560
 template 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.940
 so, but I will immediately say that not all is needed 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.070
 pattern we need micha moor 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 but only such files that are 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.740
 expansion. tpl these balls they study 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.680
 for your page is obtained when you 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.870
 go to the site then one of these files 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.810
 pro is responsible for one any country worth 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:29.350
 it turns out turns out in houses means as 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.930
 we see already and not open asked 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.090
 this plus plus n so not so here 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.979
 Now we will select all these sorrows at once. 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.440
 to finish my studies 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:53.500
 for the rat except close so open 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:57.420
 steam 16 add so we all highlighted 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.570
 open the package and here we see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.180
 encodings 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 and encode converter 8 so 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.250
 we have to do to everybody here and 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.990
 88 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.250
 So much for a long time but not long jumped 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.940
 threads are so guilty 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.940
 tank 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.189
 on 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.390
 although when 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.870
 to order 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.230
 backwards 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.250
 however the poster 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:12.910
 so perhaps they will not encode and taste 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.650
 because it's me, it means, and other and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.390
 everything can be saved then when 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.390
 and click and cedar 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.230
 all now we can go and load on 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 template 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.950
 everything 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.850
 so apparently we changed and we 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.340
 our normal letter appears 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.840
