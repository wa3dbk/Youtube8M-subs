we're<00:02:32.489> talking<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:32.760> protein<00:02:33.330> aka<00:02:33.930> bro<00:02:34.680> team

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
we're talking about protein aka bro team

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.449 
we're talking about protein aka bro team
i<00:02:35.690> would<00:02:36.690> say<00:02:36.870> whey<00:02:37.110> protein<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> whole<00:02:38.220> is

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
i would say whey protein as a whole is

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.550 
i would say whey protein as a whole is
more<00:02:38.670> necessary<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.450> bodybuilding<00:02:39.930> than<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
more necessary in bodybuilding than it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.650 
more necessary in bodybuilding than it
is<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.799> power<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.160> thing<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:42.090> necessary<00:02:42.540> at

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
is in power the thing is it necessary at

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.650 
is in power the thing is it necessary at
all<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.989> ego<00:02:43.260> or<00:02:43.410> well<00:02:43.920> no<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.480> comes

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
all for ego or well no but when it comes

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.360 
all for ego or well no but when it comes
to<00:02:45.750> something<00:02:45.930> such<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.260> power<00:02:46.590> lifting<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
to something such as power lifting the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.490 
to something such as power lifting the
main<00:02:47.549> focus<00:02:48.000> isn't<00:02:48.239> tearing<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.170> muscle

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
main focus isn't tearing the muscle

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.199 
main focus isn't tearing the muscle
fibers<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.130> feeding<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.519> protein<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.090> they

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
fibers and feeding the protein so they

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.660 
fibers and feeding the protein so they
repair<00:02:52.019> bigger<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.709> larger<00:02:52.830> although<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
repair bigger and larger although that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.310 
repair bigger and larger although that
obviously<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.269> help<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.720> strength<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.170> bit

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
obviously can help with strength a bit

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.199 
obviously can help with strength a bit
powerlifting<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.100> still<00:02:56.340> more<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.730> central

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
powerlifting is still more like central

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.509 
powerlifting is still more like central
nervous<00:02:57.720> system<00:02:58.170> days<00:02:58.350> as<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.920> power<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
nervous system days as a power of the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.070 
nervous system days as a power of the
theory<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.940> want<00:03:00.120> our<00:03:00.239> bodies<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.870> able<00:03:01.019> to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
theory we want our bodies to be able to

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.930 
theory we want our bodies to be able to
handle<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.470> much<00:03:01.709> weight<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.190> possible<00:03:02.250> and

maintaining the same body weight this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.039 
maintaining the same body weight this
way<00:03:08.820> protein<00:03:09.209> really<00:03:09.480> come<00:03:09.630> into<00:03:09.780> this

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
way protein really come into this

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.140 
way protein really come into this
equation<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.620> power<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.980> thing<00:03:11.190> personally

equation of power of thing personally

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.630 
equation of power of thing personally
for<00:03:12.180> me<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.540> haven't<00:03:13.080> really<00:03:13.320> taken<00:03:13.590> any<00:03:14.010> whey

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
for me I haven't really taken any whey

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
protein or any of anything really I

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.190 
protein or any of anything really I
managed<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.150> stay<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> same<00:03:18.720> body<00:03:18.959> weight

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200

whey<00:03:27.570> protein<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.620> far<00:03:28.709> as<00:03:28.830> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
whey protein so as far as the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.470 
whey protein so as far as the
strengthening<00:03:29.519> goes<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.239> definitely

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
strengthening goes you can definitely

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
strengthening goes you can definitely
make<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.260> these<00:03:31.470> strengths<00:03:31.799> games<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.220> L

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
make all these strengths games with L

whey protein without any other form of
supplements<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.600> haven't

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
supplements really because I haven't

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.569 
supplements really because I haven't
really<00:03:37.230> used<00:03:37.350> anything<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.220> still<00:03:38.519> be

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
really used anything and I still be

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.400 
really used anything and I still be
making<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:39.239> progression<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:40.079> makes<00:03:40.260> me

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
making some progression that makes me

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.960 
making some progression that makes me
happy<00:03:40.440> at<00:03:40.799> least<00:03:40.890> also<00:03:41.430> I've<00:03:41.579> actually<00:03:41.820> been

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
happy at least also I've actually been

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.850 
happy at least also I've actually been
vegetarian<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.720> past<00:03:42.930> three<00:03:43.260> weeks<00:03:43.470> as<00:03:43.650> well

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
vegetarian the past three weeks as well

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.390 
vegetarian the past three weeks as well
so<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> haven't<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.760> been<00:03:44.880> having<00:03:45.120> me

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
so I haven't you been having me

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.649 
so I haven't you been having me
as<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.489> protein<00:03:45.909> source<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.360> I've<00:03:46.420> still<00:03:46.599> been

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
as a protein source and I've still been

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.390 
as a protein source and I've still been
my<00:03:47.079> strength<00:03:47.260> has<00:03:47.409> still<00:03:47.650> been<00:03:47.680> climbing<00:03:48.189> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
my strength has still been climbing the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.770 
my strength has still been climbing the
ladder<00:03:48.579> really<00:03:48.939> so<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.599> current

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
ladder really so the current

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170 
ladder really so the current
recommendation<00:03:50.769> for<00:03:51.040> athletes<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:52.000> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
recommendation for athletes is to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.619 
recommendation for athletes is to
consume<00:03:52.599> 1.2<00:03:53.439> to<00:03:53.680> 1.7<00:03:54.519> grams<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.970> protein<00:03:55.180> per

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
consume 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.710 
consume 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per
day<00:03:56.200> for<00:03:56.620> each<00:03:56.680> kilo<00:03:57.069> of<00:03:57.220> body<00:03:57.579> weight<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.360> if

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
day for each kilo of body weight so if

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.039 
day for each kilo of body weight so if
you<00:03:58.810> weigh<00:03:58.980> 180<00:03:59.980> pounds<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.730> ranges<00:04:01.180> from<00:04:01.239> 97

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
you weigh 180 pounds that ranges from 97

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.929 
you weigh 180 pounds that ranges from 97
grams<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.379> protein<00:04:02.560> all<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:02.980> way<00:04:03.069> up<00:04:03.129> to<00:04:03.189> 139

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
grams of protein all the way up to 139

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.780 
grams of protein all the way up to 139
grams<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.420> protein<00:04:04.599> per<00:04:04.989> day<00:04:05.409> a<00:04:05.620> lot<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.519> people

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
grams of protein per day a lot of people

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.420 
grams of protein per day a lot of people
think<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.269> if<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.170> get<00:04:08.349> like<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.769> 100<00:04:09.220> grams

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
think that if I get like a 100 grams

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.000 
think that if I get like a 100 grams
protein<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.840> one<00:04:11.079> meal<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.530> like<00:04:11.769> I'm<00:04:11.920> going

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
protein in one meal that like I'm going

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
protein in one meal that like I'm going
to<00:04:12.069> make<00:04:12.220> all<00:04:12.400> types<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.760> games<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.359> my

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
to make all types of games and my

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.210 
to make all types of games and my
muscles<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.109> repair<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.379> way<00:04:14.739> bigger<00:04:14.980> and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
muscles going to repair a way bigger and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.890 
muscles going to repair a way bigger and
stuff<00:04:15.400> like<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.609> really<00:04:16.359> your<00:04:16.449> body<00:04:16.630> can

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
stuff like that really your body can

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.960 
stuff like that really your body can
only<00:04:16.989> absorb<00:04:17.440> roughly<00:04:17.859> around<00:04:18.039> seven<00:04:18.669> grams

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
only absorb roughly around seven grams

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.659 
only absorb roughly around seven grams
of<00:04:19.090> protein<00:04:19.329> per<00:04:19.570> hour<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.470> when<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.280> ingest

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
of protein per hour so when you ingest

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.640 
of protein per hour so when you ingest
some<00:04:21.850> with<00:04:21.970> protein<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.570> actually<00:04:22.900> slows<00:04:23.260> down

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
some with protein it actually slows down

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.500 
some with protein it actually slows down
in<00:04:23.979> your<00:04:24.160> small<00:04:24.370> intestine<00:04:24.910> just<00:04:25.120> slows<00:04:25.330> down

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
in your small intestine just slows down

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.600 
in your small intestine just slows down
the<00:04:25.990> digestive<00:04:26.560> process<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:27.100> general<00:04:27.160> and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
the digestive process in general and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.550 
the digestive process in general and
then<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.510> why<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.720> wind<00:04:29.229> up<00:04:29.350> feeling

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
then this is why you wind up feeling

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.350 
then this is why you wind up feeling
really<00:04:29.949> full<00:04:30.220> after<00:04:30.580> like<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.760> big<00:04:30.820> protein

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
really full after like a big protein

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.909 
really full after like a big protein
shake<00:04:31.570> or<00:04:31.660> something<00:04:32.020> your<00:04:32.410> body<00:04:32.620> actually

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
shake or something your body actually

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.180 
shake or something your body actually
can't<00:04:33.460> use<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:34.060> much<00:04:34.510> protein<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.800> quickly

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
can't use that much protein that quickly

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
can't use that much protein that quickly
it'll<00:04:36.940> just<00:04:37.150> like<00:04:37.270> go<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.479> wait<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
it'll just like go to wait really the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.750 
it'll just like go to wait really the
reason<00:04:38.530> we<00:04:38.770> see<00:04:38.949> these<00:04:39.130> professional

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
reason we see these professional

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.939 
reason we see these professional
bodybuilders<00:04:40.360> eating<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.199> much<00:04:41.320> protein<00:04:41.770> and

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
bodybuilders eating so much protein and

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.230 
bodybuilders eating so much protein and
eating<00:04:42.220> so<00:04:42.370> much<00:04:42.460> me<00:04:42.639> is<00:04:42.820> because<00:04:43.000> their

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
eating so much me is because their

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.360 
eating so much me is because their
bodies<00:04:43.389> can<00:04:43.720> actually<00:04:44.110> use<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.680> protein

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
bodies can actually use that protein

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.760 
bodies can actually use that protein
effectively<00:04:45.910> especially<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:46.960> take<00:04:47.169> on<00:04:47.380> like

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
effectively especially they take on like

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.159 
effectively especially they take on like
testosterone<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.550> all<00:04:48.669> these<00:04:48.789> other<00:04:48.990> HGH<00:04:49.990> all

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
testosterone and all these other HGH all

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.420 
testosterone and all these other HGH all
these<00:04:50.289> other<00:04:50.470> types<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.740> drugs<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.070> stuff<00:04:51.220> too

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
these other types of drugs and stuff too

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.740 
these other types of drugs and stuff too
it<00:04:51.669> actually<00:04:51.880> increases<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.449> rate<00:04:52.720> of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
it actually increases the rate of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.839 
it actually increases the rate of
protein<00:04:53.289> synthesis<00:04:53.800> meaning<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.550> their

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
protein synthesis meaning that their

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.790 
protein synthesis meaning that their
body<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.300> actually<00:04:55.690> use<00:04:55.900> all<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.440> protein

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
body can actually use all the protein

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.170 
body can actually use all the protein
that<00:04:56.889> they're<00:04:57.010> taking<00:04:57.340> in<00:04:57.460> order<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.940> repair

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that they're taking in order to repair

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.490 
that they're taking in order to repair
them<00:04:58.360> also<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:58.960> double<00:04:59.320> time

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
them also this like double time

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.439 
them also this like double time
basically<00:04:59.919> continuing<00:05:00.699> offer<00:05:00.849> what<00:05:01.120> Derrick

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
basically continuing offer what Derrick

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.080 
basically continuing offer what Derrick
just<00:05:01.659> said<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:02.169> totally<00:05:02.830> agree<00:05:02.949> having<00:05:03.849> protein

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
just said I totally agree having protein

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.149 
just said I totally agree having protein
as<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.449> supplement<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.260> not<00:05:05.409> really<00:05:05.680> necessary

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
as a supplement is not really necessary

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.210 
as a supplement is not really necessary

high protein diet is in order to come

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.950 
high protein diet is in order to come

172 190 grams of protein I usually take

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.149 
172 190 grams of protein I usually take
about<00:05:27.900> two<00:05:28.900> scoops<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.409> protein<00:05:29.560> every<00:05:29.979> day

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
about two scoops of protein every day

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.129 
about two scoops of protein every day
just<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.520> reach<00:05:30.760> my<00:05:31.000> protein<00:05:31.419> goals<00:05:31.750> because

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
just to reach my protein goals because
