00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.350
 Hello, good kids, I'm fine 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.150
 crack 10 welcome to a new video 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.369
 for my channel welcome to call of duty 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.140
 black ops 2 200 likes for more you are 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.300
 looking down today I bring you the first 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 1 versus 1 spawn trap tutorial 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.429
 sniper on the map of newtown 2025 I'm going 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.259
 to teach a few spawn back to 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.449
 nothing but reappear the enemy can 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.130
 kill and is a skill that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.810
 develops then with practice with 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.610
 time and with patience to the people 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 so good here we see that the first 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 spawn travel first spa though 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 we have to catch him and if we kill him 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 we kill for this area will reappear in 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.039
 that area we have to shoot where 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.719
 fired me in the blue trash can in the 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.699
 white area of the blue trash can there 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.989
 where I'm pointing right now to 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.910
 those areas where you have to shoot for 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.859
 kill him just to reappear is very 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.359
 important to hurry so that the uncle 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.460
 do not move because as soon as you move 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.410
 Well, we're not going to be able to kill him, 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 important to remove the death chamber 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.280
 because if we are with death chamber 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.480
 it will not come out but if we see that what 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.949
 we do pretty fast and I'm doing 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.540
 quite slow to ensure the low 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.130
 As you are seeing there, you have the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.259
 first spam the second of those that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.939
 they shoot right there at the books of 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.510
 right if we shoot right there's 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.310
 uploaded 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.870
 this area is very important that you 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 put at all times where I am 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.960
 located and you shoot right where 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.910
 I am shooting what is where it is going to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 restore the enemy that we just 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.640
 kill worth people and this only serves to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.870
 one of those 1 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 we can also do it with weapons but 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.330
 obviously it will be more difficult 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.830
 we need armored bullets but if you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 we do with sniper and we get 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.710
 develop stability we will be very 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.690
 good and we will be able to get 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 an ultra amazing spa here is that 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 I kill the first one again then here 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 we see that we shoot here just 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 under the books on the right and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.150
 we killed him and again here we go to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.980
 to repeat it again so you can find out 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.420
 better let's shoot the part of the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.460
 bombonera was just to the area 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.810
 white we come here books of the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.820
 right now we have the seconds the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 second spawn and the third then good 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 there may be several what happens now 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 yes it reappears badly that is how it has 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.850
 reappeared to me then we can shoot 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.710
 exactly where I had shot this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.970
 little corner and let's kill him if he's in 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.890
 that corner that we have to give 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.690
 pretty fast people are going to ya 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.450
 I will teach more spawn back that would be the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.399
 spa a 50 infinite track because I have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.570
 colleagues who do not know how to do also we 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.860
 I would like to thank my colleague 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.900
 madridista that is the one that has taught me 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 to do this here we see another spawn if you 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.660
 we kill in this area of ​​the car is going to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.520
 answer just where we finish it 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.140
 to kill and now if we kill him here 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.500
 just attached to the car not in the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.940
 zone 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 If we get stuck in the car, we kill him 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 we point to the area of ​​the red box and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.000
 where is the little arrow up 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.500
 we shoot and we're going to get kill him 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.210
 will do later I will show you and as 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.130
 we said thanks to my Madridista colleague 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.000
 what is it that has taught me all this 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.200
 it's worth people 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.020
 good kids here you see I'm going to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.330
 wait for the enemy to return 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.430
 kill again we put here to point there 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.510
 where the red box shot and again 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.580
 I hope you have found the first 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.140
 tutorial we'll see you in the next video 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.140
