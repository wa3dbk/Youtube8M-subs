probably my best game playing this is
just<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.780> gameplay<00:01:28.170> I've<00:01:28.350> recorded<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.159> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
just some gameplay I've recorded up for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.499 
just some gameplay I've recorded up for
you<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.579> show<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> gun<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you to show the gun you know but this is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.800 
you to show the gun you know but this is
it<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.170> we've<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:35.000> 800<00:01:36.000> rate<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> fire

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it you know we've got 800 rate of fire

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
it you know we've got 800 rate of fire
and<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.070> drop<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:38.880> after<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> think

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and we have a drop off after I think

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.679 
and we have a drop off after I think
it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.840> 55<00:01:40.530> meters<00:01:40.979> down<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:41.939> 18<00:01:42.450> or

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it's a 55 meters down to about 18 or

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's a 55 meters down to about 18 or
something<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.229> damage<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> 18<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
something like that damage of 18 you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
something like that damage of 18 you
know<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.899> okay<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.829> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
know so that's that's okay you know that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
know so that's that's okay you know that
that's<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.430> good<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> compare

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that's pretty good but when you compare

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.100 
that's pretty good but when you compare
it<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.520> ACW<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:51.299> more<00:01:51.450> como<00:01:52.070> shown<00:01:53.070> here

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it to the ACW or more como shown here

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.639 
it to the ACW or more como shown here
right<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:56.090> 880<00:01:57.090> rate<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> fire<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.380> I'm

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
right we have a 880 rate of fire now I'm

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
right we have a 880 rate of fire now I'm
an<00:01:58.860> ass<00:01:59.009> that's<00:01:59.399> fast<00:01:59.759> that's<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.270> ballistic

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
an ass that's fast that's like ballistic
fast<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.189> say<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:03.000> too

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
fast some would say you know that's too

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
fast some would say you know that's too
fast<00:02:03.659> very<00:02:04.170> hard<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.850> keep

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
fast very hard to keep it you know keep

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
fast very hard to keep it you know keep
it<00:02:06.810> steady<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.009> got<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> very

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it steady you know the it's got a very

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.090 
it steady you know the it's got a very
low<00:02:08.700> recoil<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.479> gun<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:10.229> yeah<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.770> 880

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
low recoil this gun but yeah at 880

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.480 
low recoil this gun but yeah at 880

gonna be people say it's gonna be hard

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.620 
gonna be people say it's gonna be hard
to<00:02:18.020> keep<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.380> target<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.700> know<00:02:19.820> which<00:02:20.330> I

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
to keep it on target you know which I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.930 
to keep it on target you know which I
must<00:02:21.140> say<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.550> struggle<00:02:22.550> with<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.670> lover<00:02:22.880> but

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
must say I struggle with a lover but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.760 
must say I struggle with a lover but
don't<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.570> find<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.260> much<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.620> know

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
don't really find that so much you know

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.590 
don't really find that so much you know
you<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.160> gotta<00:02:25.400> compensate<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.240> recoil

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
you just gotta compensate for the recoil

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
you just gotta compensate for the recoil
a<00:02:26.690> bit<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.740> yeah<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.190> longer<00:02:28.460> shots

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
a bit you know yeah there's longer shots

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.760 
a bit you know yeah there's longer shots
are<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> bit<00:02:29.780> tricky<00:02:29.930> with<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.380> bit

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
are you know a bit tricky with it bit

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.490 
are you know a bit tricky with it bit
tricky<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.730> definitely<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.510> i<00:02:32.630> said<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.960> m16

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
tricky and definitely as i said the m16

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.170 
tricky and definitely as i said the m16
is<00:02:33.680> much<00:02:33.950> better<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.370> distance<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.910> know<00:02:34.970> that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
is much better at distance you know that

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.680 
is much better at distance you know that
pinpoint<00:02:35.690> accuracy<00:02:36.100> awesome<00:02:37.100> awesome<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:38.450> i

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
pinpoint accuracy awesome awesome but i

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.010 
pinpoint accuracy awesome awesome but i
have<00:02:39.200> found<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:40.570> setting<00:02:41.570> has<00:02:41.630> gone<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:41.900> in

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
have found that setting has gone up in

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.500 
have found that setting has gone up in
the<00:02:42.050> way<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.350> I've<00:02:42.470> set<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:42.740> up<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.910> find

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
the way that I've set it up that I find

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
the way that I've set it up that I find
myself<00:02:44.630> leaning<00:02:44.990> towards<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.770> honest<00:02:46.040> I

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
myself leaning towards it to be honest I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.940 
myself leaning towards it to be honest I
mean<00:02:46.520> I'm<00:02:46.760> doing<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.660> comparison<00:02:48.440> video<00:02:48.740> I'm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
mean I'm doing this comparison video I'm

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.680 
mean I'm doing this comparison video I'm
really<00:02:49.310> interested<00:02:49.520> in<00:02:49.820> what<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.210> guys<00:02:50.390> think

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
really interested in what you guys think

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
really interested in what you guys think
because<00:02:50.990> I'm<00:02:51.560> kind<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.190> confused<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.730> bit

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
because I'm kind of a bit confused a bit

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760 
because I'm kind of a bit confused a bit
like<00:02:53.030> which<00:02:53.810> one<00:02:54.020> should<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.200> google<00:02:54.650> I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
like which one should have google I

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.340 
like which one should have google I
don't<00:02:55.100> know<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.730> as<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.420> can<00:02:56.480> see<00:02:56.630> I'm<00:02:56.810> kind

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
don't know but as you can see I'm kind

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.440 
don't know but as you can see I'm kind
of<00:02:57.470> finding<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.920> am<00:02:58.090> doing<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.210> bit<00:02:59.420> more

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
of finding that I am doing a bit more

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.170 
of finding that I am doing a bit more
devastation<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> ACW<00:03:01.280> I've<00:03:01.880> got<00:03:02.120> this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
devastation with the ACW I've got this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.030 
devastation with the ACW I've got this
set<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.450> got<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.020> set<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.440> virtually<00:03:03.950> gone

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
set up got it set up a virtually gone

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.830 
set up got it set up a virtually gone
for<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> heavy<00:03:04.580> barrel<00:03:04.760> which<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.570> don't

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
for the heavy barrel which I don't

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.330 
for the heavy barrel which I don't
really<00:03:05.990> like<00:03:06.080> him<00:03:06.470> via<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:06.950> much<00:03:07.130> but

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
really like him via for that much but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.850 
really like him via for that much but
put<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.270> gun<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.930> really<00:03:09.380> finding<00:03:09.740> it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
put it on this gun and really finding it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.340 
put it on this gun and really finding it
that<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.810> slicing<00:03:11.810> through<00:03:11.840> people

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
that it is just slicing through people

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.040 
that it is just slicing through people
you<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:13.070> given<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> ACW<00:03:14.270> that<00:03:14.750> bit<00:03:15.020> of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
you know it's given the ACW that bit of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.100 
you know it's given the ACW that bit of
a<00:03:15.200> reach<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.220> bit<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.430> punch<00:03:16.880> far<00:03:17.750> out<00:03:17.960> that

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
a reach that bit of punch far out that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.240 
a reach that bit of punch far out that
it<00:03:18.230> seems<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> lack<00:03:18.770> because<00:03:19.070> there's<00:03:19.190> a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
it seems to lack because there's a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.580 
it seems to lack because there's a
carbide<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.910> an<00:03:20.000> engineer<00:03:20.390> rifle<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.350> know<00:03:21.470> it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
carbide in an engineer rifle you know it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.100 
carbide in an engineer rifle you know it
seems<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.980> lack<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.940> busy<00:03:23.240> whack<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> heavy

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
seems to lack that busy whack a heavy

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.290 
seems to lack that busy whack a heavy
barrel<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:25.340> really<00:03:25.700> helps<00:03:26.060> out<00:03:26.150> you

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
barrel on it it really helps out you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.430 
barrel on it it really helps out you
know<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.690> doesn't<00:03:26.720> suffer<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.380> much

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
know and it doesn't suffer that much

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.120 
know and it doesn't suffer that much
from<00:03:28.450> recoil<00:03:29.450> because<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.750> low<00:03:30.050> recoil<00:03:30.260> gun<00:03:30.650> but

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
from recoil because a low recoil gun but

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.030 
from recoil because a low recoil gun but
whacked<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.520> them<00:03:31.820> put<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.740> angled<00:03:33.740> grip<00:03:33.740> on

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
whacked on them put the angled grip on

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.650 
whacked on them put the angled grip on
it<00:03:34.070> which<00:03:34.250> obviously<00:03:34.460> then<00:03:34.760> reduces<00:03:35.330> recoil

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
it which obviously then reduces recoil

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.900 
it which obviously then reduces recoil
as<00:03:35.990> well<00:03:36.140> as<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.830> can<00:03:36.950> see<00:03:37.040> I'm<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.790> all

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
as well as you can see I'm this is all

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030 
as well as you can see I'm this is all
quite<00:03:38.030> close<00:03:38.300> quarter<00:03:38.570> stuff<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.860> heavy

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
quite close quarter stuff with the heavy

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.310 
quite close quarter stuff with the heavy
