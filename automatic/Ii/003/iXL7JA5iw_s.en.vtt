00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I've been using save states and the only

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.970 
I've been using save states and the only
problem<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.000> safe<00:00:51.360> States<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
problem is that if I use safe States and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.080 
problem is that if I use safe States and
after<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> beat<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> Elite<00:00:53.460> Four<00:00:53.730> since<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
after I beat the Elite Four since I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.010 
after I beat the Elite Four since I
haven't<00:00:54.390> used<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> game<00:00:55.250> itself<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.489> save

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
haven't used the game itself to save

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.119 
haven't used the game itself to save
it's<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.260> gonna<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.739> data

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it's not gonna have all that data

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
it's not gonna have all that data
recorded<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.840> only<00:01:01.199> way<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
recorded so the only way to get to the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.880 
recorded so the only way to get to the
savvy<00:01:04.439> islands<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.580> saved<00:01:06.799> using<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
game saving feature which I cans because

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
game saving feature which I cans because
it<00:01:10.500> tells<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> used<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.880> change<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it tells me that I used to change the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.679 
it tells me that I used to change the
backup<00:01:12.600> memory<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:13.170> whatever<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.630> know

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
backup memory or whatever so and I know

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570 
backup memory or whatever so and I know
there<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> fix<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> did<00:01:17.430> not

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
there is a way to fix that but I did not

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
there is a way to fix that but I did not
even<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> started

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
even think about that when I started

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
even think about that when I started
this<00:01:19.740> LP<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.570> oh<00:01:21.720> that's<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.049> you

safe<00:01:22.500> States<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.890> should<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> okay<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.580> did

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
safe States I should be okay but I did

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
safe States I should be okay but I did
not<00:01:23.820> think<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.409> actually

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
not think about that and I actually

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.210 
not think about that and I actually
didn't<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:27.320> well<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.409> guess<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.920> did

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
didn't know that like well I guess I did

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
didn't know that like well I guess I did
I<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.430> didn't<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.869> in

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I just didn't really think about it in

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.530 
I just didn't really think about it in
depth<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.390> actually

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
depth because you know I was actually

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.170 
depth because you know I was actually
very<00:01:33.960> excited<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> after<00:01:35.520> game<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
very excited to do the after game of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.170 
very excited to do the after game of
this<00:01:36.299> game<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
this game but you know the way it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.399 
this game but you know the way it's
looking<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> don't<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.320> able

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
looking now I don't think I'll be able

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.109 
looking now I don't think I'll be able
to<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> unless<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.759> played<00:01:41.970> through

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to do it unless I just played through

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.899 
to do it unless I just played through
the<00:01:42.210> whole<00:01:42.479> game<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.020> again<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.670> get

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the whole game all over again and get

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
the whole game all over again and get
everything<00:01:45.270> again<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
everything again and then just go to the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100 
everything again and then just go to the
savvy<00:01:47.880> islands<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.360> whenever<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.780> didn't<00:01:48.990> get

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
savvy islands like whenever I didn't get

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.429 
savvy islands like whenever I didn't get
there<00:01:49.290> again<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:50.369> probably<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> like

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
there again which probably will be like

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.370 
there again which probably will be like
another<00:01:52.439> month<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.180> unless<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.509> play

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
another month or two unless I just play

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
after I beat the game that pretty much

after I beat the game that pretty much
sucks<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> means<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.990> can't<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
sucks and that means I just can't do the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.749 
sucks and that means I just can't do the
the<00:02:09.289> Savion<00:02:09.739> instance<00:02:10.159> I'm<00:02:10.310> using<00:02:10.459> save

states<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.390> didn't<00:02:11.629> use<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> in-game<00:02:12.019> save

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
states and I didn't use the in-game save

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.729 
states and I didn't use the in-game save
feature<00:02:12.799> because<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.159> couldn't<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:15.500> yeah<00:02:15.680> I

whole game again I'll use my own LP to
see<00:02:51.530> what<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.799> did<00:02:51.919> and<00:02:52.340> I'll<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.790> follow<00:02:53.150> that

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.940 
and I'll do it all over again and I'll
use<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.329> fix<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.079> found<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.680> actually

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
use the fix that I found to actually

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.159 
use the fix that I found to actually
save<00:02:58.280> using<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.790> get<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.030> save<00:02:59.269> game<00:02:59.689> feature

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
save using the get the save game feature

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.670 
save using the get the save game feature
in<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.310> actual<00:03:01.579> game<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.230> then<00:03:03.230> once<00:03:03.469> I<00:03:03.620> get

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
in the actual game and then once I get

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.640 
in the actual game and then once I get
to<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.129> Elite<00:03:04.609> Four<00:03:04.639> and<00:03:05.239> beat'em<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.810> then

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
to the Elite Four and beat'em and then

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.470 
to the Elite Four and beat'em and then
go<00:03:07.099> to<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.310> savvy<00:03:07.519> islands<00:03:07.879> I'll<00:03:08.060> probably

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
go to the savvy islands I'll probably

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.250 
go to the savvy islands I'll probably
start<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.959> again

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
start it again

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.780 
start it again
kind<00:03:09.439> of<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.709> what<00:03:09.859> chuggaaconroy<00:03:10.189> did<00:03:10.669> with

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
kind of like what chuggaaconroy did with

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.699 
kind of like what chuggaaconroy did with
his<00:03:10.969> fire<00:03:11.150> NLP<00:03:11.629> like<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.319> stopped<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.680> right

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
his fire NLP like you stopped it right

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.619 
his fire NLP like you stopped it right
here<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.129> then<00:03:13.220> like<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.639> month<00:03:14.120> or<00:03:14.239> two<00:03:14.419> later

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
here and then like a month or two later

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.740 
here and then like a month or two later
he<00:03:14.720> continued<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.440> Sevi<00:03:15.709> Islands<00:03:16.099> I<00:03:16.540> might<00:03:17.540> do

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
he continued the Sevi Islands I might do

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.050 
he continued the Sevi Islands I might do
that<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.409> you<00:03:19.069> know<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.639> I<00:03:19.729> have<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:19.970> go

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
that because you know if I have to go

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.659 
that because you know if I have to go
through<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.419> whole<00:03:20.659> game<00:03:20.840> again<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:22.400> just

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
through a whole game again you know just

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.399 
through a whole game again you know just
to<00:03:22.760> show<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.269> will<00:03:23.419> do<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.930> I'm<00:03:24.139> not

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
to show that I will do it I'm not

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.179 
to show that I will do it I'm not
kidding

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
kidding

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.969 
kidding
as<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.939> did<00:03:26.180> say<00:03:26.389> I<00:03:26.419> wasn't<00:03:26.720> going<00:03:27.139> to<00:03:27.169> 100%<00:03:27.590> this

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
as I did say I wasn't going to 100% this

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.429 
as I did say I wasn't going to 100% this
game<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.760> really<00:03:29.180> do<00:03:29.329> want<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:29.959> that's

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
game and I really do want to so that's

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.050 
game and I really do want to so that's
probably<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.829> only<00:03:31.099> thing<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.489> can<00:03:31.639> do<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
probably the only thing I can do and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.479 
probably the only thing I can do and
it's<00:03:32.269> gonna<00:03:32.389> take<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.629> while<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it's gonna take a while and in the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's gonna take a while and in the
meantime<00:03:34.669> I'm<00:03:35.090> probably<00:03:35.329> just<00:03:35.449> gonna<00:03:35.689> be

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
meantime I'm probably just gonna be

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.129 
meantime I'm probably just gonna be
starting<00:03:36.229> my<00:03:36.319> next<00:03:36.379> LP<00:03:37.069> which<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.449> don't<00:03:38.870> know

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
starting my next LP which I don't know

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.839 
starting my next LP which I don't know
if<00:03:39.229> I've<00:03:39.349> mentioned<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.889> but<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.099> do<00:03:40.250> want<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:40.729> do

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
if I've mentioned it but I do want to do
