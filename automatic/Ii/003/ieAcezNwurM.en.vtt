00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
I'm not saying one were the other

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.700 
I'm not saying one were the other
exactly<00:04:29.699> what<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> am<00:04:31.289> saying<00:04:31.590> the

exactly what that is but I am saying the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.540 
exactly what that is but I am saying the
possibility<00:04:32.430> exists<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.300> then<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.479> ask<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.050> is

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
possibility exists so then I ask you is

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.820 
possibility exists so then I ask you is
this<00:04:35.550> an<00:04:35.789> example<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.539> us<00:04:36.780> actually<00:04:37.229> capturing

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
this an example of us actually capturing

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.930 
this an example of us actually capturing
a<00:04:38.039> glimpse<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.729> one<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.330> these<00:04:39.710> beings<00:04:40.940> among

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
a glimpse of one of these beings among

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.140 
a glimpse of one of these beings among
us<00:04:42.169> this<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.410> not<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.830> first<00:04:43.979> time<00:04:44.340> this<00:04:44.849> kind

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
us this is not the first time this kind

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.640 
us this is not the first time this kind
of<00:04:45.210> an<00:04:45.330> anomaly<00:04:45.780> has<00:04:45.900> been<00:04:46.110> captured<00:04:46.500> on<00:04:46.620> film

of an anomaly has been captured on film
it<00:04:47.639> happens<00:04:48.060> quite<00:04:48.389> a<00:04:48.449> bit<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:50.490> who<00:04:50.639> knows<00:04:51.830> but

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
it happens quite a bit so who knows but

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.680 
it happens quite a bit so who knows but
it<00:04:52.979> would<00:04:53.099> stand<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.430> reason<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:54.300> if<00:04:54.479> one<00:04:54.660> of

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
it would stand to reason that if one of

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.469 
it would stand to reason that if one of
these<00:04:54.840> wicked<00:04:55.530> beings<00:04:55.860> were<00:04:56.099> among<00:04:56.430> us<00:04:56.580> then

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
these wicked beings were among us then
