00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.389
 eyes flowed red began 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.030
 watery and we run to the pharmacy give what 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.180
 something drops and give us comes 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.200
 slight improvement and then everything again 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.330
 Valeria what exactly such a situation when 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.019
 going to build circumstances 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.179
 related trays of self taxes 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.189
 what eyes of the plot that's all 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.279
 for it became said that everything turned out that 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.749
 do parking than it should be very very 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.880
 then something started halfway such an option 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.570
 but the drug that we most often take in 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.599
 such cases in the pharmacy did not help 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.940
 and no wonder conjunctivitis is cunning 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.430
 he is political 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.559
 bacterial viral and therefore 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.570
 should be treated differently and not one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.839
 bubble to 5 any compass now not 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.609
 always try a doctor because 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.960
 the doctor during treatment combine 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110
 3 4 5 drugs specific 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.240
 sequences 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.150
 never a pharmacist 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.670
 neither the patient himself will be able to 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.170
 such a thing has dropped the maximum that can 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.020
 acting employee advise in which 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.200
 something antibiotic which but he only 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.740
 200 proton cases can really 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.180
 work maria is one of the few who in 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 such cases see a doctor 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170
 the rest wash your eyes useless 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.180
 tea brew and 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.910
 dig up vasoconstrictor 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.340
 drops which only masks the disease and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.400
 it becomes chronic 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.920
 now patient individually 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.050
 selects drugs only it allows 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.850
 minimize the risk of possible 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.200
 unpleasant consequences 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.710
 this is the worst of them is a syndrome 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.930
 dry eyes are diagnosed by us 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.870
 with the help of such test strips 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.560
 they fit for a few minutes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.040
 between the lower eyelid and the eye the strip should 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.289
 there was a coefficient year to this mark 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.959
 But does this mean that in excess of the approved 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.650
 what is missing from the patient 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.040
 this drug is desirable 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.509
 end any treatment of conjunctivitis 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.649
 but unfortunately this is not a standard and doctor 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.899
 the usual clinic, he probably did not 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.670
 will appoint what he is likely to do 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.390
 if he feels dry 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.909
 try and try yourself as 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.790
 skillfully if it's the only one 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.520
 harmless drops that can be in 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.820

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.369
 dry eye disease is a disease 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 unpleasant 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.479
 feeling the sand of the risks until it is 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.560
 some sufferer 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.229
 have to bury the visa before 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.349
 twenty-five times a day and in their number 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.530
 every fourth can get exactly 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.090
 so many people predisposed to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 this disease run which 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.830
 can including undertreated 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.390
