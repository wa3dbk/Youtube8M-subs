00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 speaks youtube crowd is being well 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.769
 coming to yet another line of black 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.719
 box 2 here on our channel only to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.449
 inform you I still won I caught 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.359
 she then the movie we saw that gave a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.630
 cut and I still lost her than at first 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 I have not been with her since the beginning but 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 I'm finally bringing you to talk. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 of a subject is about some 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 there guns there in fact the judgment that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.719
 frevo and military 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is clear that the course of the match 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.120
 has problem him wa itaÃº other weapons 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 but to imitate is it already comes unlocked 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.590
 in the first salt rifle that comes 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.450
 unlocked game and this is a subject 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 interesting and it was in this video with you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 it is good in this case of a second 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.649
 baseline in the match was 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 round the stage for fear that the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 staff on Friday on the back of the flag 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 so I gave him one seguradinha remain 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.320
 not to lose the strike 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 but even then only coming back from the guns there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.810
 the one thing I find interesting in na 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.000
 series of the future channel and knows what it wants 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 the weapons issue you have some 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 areas that comes unlocked is already by 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 standard you have some weapons that you 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.750
 You do not need or buy or take up to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.790
 to be able to unlock it, it's actually 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 knows an interesting thing by the way 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.860
 these weapons there are the best weapons of the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 game I actually do not know if the dream 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 I realize that the system people who 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 agree with me can we make a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.729
 retrospective and since almost 4 years ago 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 can game 4 know the m 16 actually 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:45.060
 the m16 with it original so without anything 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.939
 Let's just say yes, the game can not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.250
 Being rusty is very bad. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.320
 only if you put a red dot on it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 she made the game better and did not 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.270
 it was simply one of the most 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.670
 used in code 41 is that it is the best 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.549
 coffee and very interesting also in a mw2 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 Someone remembers the fame of mw2 because it's in the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.380
 true to forms is like this 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.380
 one of the weapons that comes unlocked right now 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 the tomato will fame if the mp remembers 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.349
 no he's 45 32 and you miss him 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.380
 mw2 actually the cr weapons fame very much 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.900
 good actually, then it was the best 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.209
 mw2 arms and you needed to do 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.660
 something to change them nothing 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.459
 simply the game already brought to you 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.090
 Actually, then it 's interesting that it is 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.069
 truth 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.170
 the best weapons are already at your 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.910
 this will be the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.489
 avoid is an example that I have here in 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.410
 church for you here it will really be 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.480
 really to imitate a good health 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.910
 risk to the game I have no experience 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.819
 none for you to imitate 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 few gameplay of the game imitate is me 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.830
 I have more experience with imitating 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.709
 on the shoulders of the men 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.069
 to be honest or not in this one in the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.989
 interesting multiplayer mask then it is 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.849
 a very good game thing and not much with 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.640
 But it 's not that slow yet it's not 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.970
 worth the cash view and why 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.310
 maybe we games that are released by 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.019
 last are not the most commonly used 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.570
 I do not even remember 3 for example the fadi do 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.640
 was the last rich salt released 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.709
 together with animals enclosed in quotation marks 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.109
 type was not one of the most played weapons 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.180
 in fact the series let's say so 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.739
 saw that was actually used the most 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.480
 the only thing there corrects mp 7 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.989
 it was also an intermediate weapon 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.579
 issue of unblocking before but she 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.859
 was one of the best weapons one of the weapons 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.840
 one more more used 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.700
 so we have a dream to 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.310
 anyone get there whats the scheme 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.730
 that suggested to him between guns and I 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.500
 or is it as a rule a whole pattern 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.840
 All the last gun that you 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.650
 unlock would be to improve but understood 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.120
 our case here in mw2 came close 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.269
 of your reality 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.700
 our last salt henry fra n 94 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.840
 correct and it is one of the most 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.750
 used 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.420
 not my opinion is not one of the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.060
 weapons 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.980
 Imagine I 'm in this salt. 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.810
 jackson by using a little more 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.020
 need 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.820
 but it is a weapon that I see more being 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.770
 played on what goes around the other 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.800
 again so on the fifth the others 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.810
 eyes then it would be interesting 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.600
 regularize this you may not need 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.780
 to evolve a lot to have a good time to 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.990
 you only get 11 with some weapon 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.540
 more simple homage to imitate in the case 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.850
 and is not one of the best weapons but she is 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.680
 a great weapon she was already for you 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.840
 then started sometimes you lay 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.880
 a specific beauty tactic indeed 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.400
 and let's see, it's not my big 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.920
 expectation of the mw frame I was talking to 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.860
 You 're all the time to change with four 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.620
 because I see the time to leave the game gave 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.050
 still for 4 series fire engine I 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.510
 I think that's where I get better. 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.450
 understood the areas where 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.640
 need it are the damage is minor the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.910
 weapons in fact the series our damage of the 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.740
 mw2 series was very weak just want 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.350
 a comfortable area to play in 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.330
 truth fame then fame around 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.770
 also damn when more areas 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.790
 game elements already comes unlocked 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.370
 for you right 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.340
 so I'm really going to wait there 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.010
 come with legal zeros on November 4 and 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.620
 if this is going to keep you in the best shape 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.020
 So this analysis is that people 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.410
 doing there that the best weapons 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.050
 are the first nations just you know 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.930
 set her up let her come with the 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.120
 tactic is good right will get it out will 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.470
 help or not is that 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.470
 pipeline what brings
