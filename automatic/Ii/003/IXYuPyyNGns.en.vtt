00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
to do turns in between the double

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.490 
to do turns in between the double
otherwise<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.609> would<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.790> too<00:03:20.939> big<00:03:21.349> are<00:03:22.349> you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
otherwise it would be too big are you

otherwise it would be too big are you
strong<00:03:25.129> time<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.340> go<00:03:26.459> up<00:03:26.780> ready<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:28.260> sure

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
strong time to go up ready not sure

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.229 
strong time to go up ready not sure
under<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.950> Sun<00:03:29.159> so<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:29.549> when<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:29.819> got<00:03:29.970> one

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
under the Sun so I'm when it's got one

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.159 
under the Sun so I'm when it's got one

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
last time I way up and then figure it

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.750 
last time I way up and then figure it
out<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:36.349> also<00:03:37.349> figures<00:03:37.919> Bruce<00:03:38.370> groans

everything's<00:03:39.450> class<00:03:40.400> right<00:03:41.400> unless<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.090> bet

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.170 

at<00:04:47.470> least<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.920> got<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.430> bottom<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.850> my<00:04:48.880> feet

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
at least I got the bottom of my feet

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.910 
at least I got the bottom of my feet
that's<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.690> good<00:04:49.930> point<00:04:50.080> I'm<00:04:50.500> not<00:04:50.530> real<00:04:50.890> happy

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
that's a good point I'm not real happy

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.460 
that's a good point I'm not real happy
with<00:04:51.460> my<00:04:51.760> skiing<00:04:52.060> maybe<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.570> little<00:04:53.200> bit<00:04:53.350> too

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
with my skiing maybe a little bit too

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.590 
with my skiing maybe a little bit too
slow<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.710> don't<00:04:53.950> know<00:04:54.150> judges<00:04:55.150> didn't<00:04:55.420> really

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
slow I don't know judges didn't really

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.010

like<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:57.030> guess<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.150> will<00:04:58.300> have<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.480> do

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.830 
like it so I guess I will have to do
better<00:04:59.200> for<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.530> next<00:04:59.740> one<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.750> but<00:05:01.750> I'm
