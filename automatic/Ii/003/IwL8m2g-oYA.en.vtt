00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
you call this thing kind of goes in and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.570 
you call this thing kind of goes in and
out<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:43.770> doesn't<00:04:44.770> go<00:04:44.950> up<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.250> down<00:04:45.340> though

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
out and doesn't go up and down though

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.130 
out and doesn't go up and down though
and<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.150> not<00:04:46.600> really<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.930> ball-joint

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
and this is not really on a ball-joint

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.500 
and this is not really on a ball-joint
just<00:04:47.560> kind<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.740> goes<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:49.360> then

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
just kind of goes like this but then

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.090 
just kind of goes like this but then
it's<00:04:49.660> also<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:50.020> chick<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.320> lated<00:04:50.590> right<00:04:50.770> here

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
it's also a chick you lated right here

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's also a chick you lated right here

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
they're not on ball joint but they go up

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.260 
they're not on ball joint but they go up
a<00:05:31.230> back<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:32.470> forth<00:05:32.620> they<00:05:33.280> go<00:05:33.430> all<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.970> way<00:05:34.000> out

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
a back and forth they go all the way out

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.790 
a back and forth they go all the way out
and<00:05:34.980> they<00:05:35.980> rotate<00:05:36.130> at<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.580> hip<00:05:37.150> they're<00:05:37.800> from

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
and they rotate at the hip they're from

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.420 
and they rotate at the hip they're from
the<00:05:38.890> thigh

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
the thigh

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.610 
the thigh
it's<00:05:40.270> got<00:05:40.420> single<00:05:40.690> jointed<00:05:40.900> knees<00:05:40.960> but<00:05:41.350> again

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
it's got single jointed knees but again

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.860 
it's got single jointed knees but again
because<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.070> boots<00:05:42.570> doesn't<00:05:43.570> really<00:05:43.690> move

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
because of the boots doesn't really move

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.590 
because of the boots doesn't really move
that<00:05:44.050> well<00:05:44.230> and<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.650> think<00:05:44.890> these<00:05:45.300> these<00:05:46.300> just

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
that well and I think these these just

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.230 
that well and I think these these just
have<00:05:46.720> single<00:05:47.020> jointed<00:05:47.290> and<00:05:47.590> then<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.790> foot

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
have single jointed and then the foot

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.850 
have single jointed and then the foot
goes<00:05:49.990> all<00:05:50.230> the<00:05:50.260> way<00:05:50.350> up<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:51.210> doesn't<00:05:52.210> spin<00:05:52.630> so
