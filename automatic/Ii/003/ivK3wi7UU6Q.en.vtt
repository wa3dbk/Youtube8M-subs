doubt<00:01:42.869> someone<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.469> ionic<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.340> he's

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
doubt someone like ionic because he's

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.879 
doubt someone like ionic because he's
the<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.749> behind<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.409> four<00:01:46.649> point

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
the one that was behind the four point

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:48.830 
the one that was behind the four point
three<00:01:46.950> point<00:01:47.189> three<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.999> tethered<00:01:48.389> jailbreak

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
three point three on tethered jailbreak

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.819 
three point three on tethered jailbreak
and<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.990> basically<00:01:52.139> all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and that is and basically all the on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.309 
and that is and basically all the on
tethers<00:01:53.219> for<00:01:53.249> those<00:01:53.929> version<00:01:54.929> so<00:01:55.109> that's

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
tethers for those version so that's

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.590 
tethers for those version so that's
definitely<00:01:55.530> something<00:01:55.799> big<00:01:56.249> and<00:01:56.600> he's
