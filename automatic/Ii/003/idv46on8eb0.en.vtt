00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
there but it's going in just melting

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
there but it's going in just melting
that<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> pan<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> sprinkle<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that in the pan I'm going to sprinkle a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
that in the pan I'm going to sprinkle a
tiny<00:01:25.740> bit<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> sugar<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.430> help<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
tiny bit of sugar to help with the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
tiny bit of sugar to help with the
caramelization<00:01:28.009> just<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.369> pair<00:01:29.579> into

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
caramelization just kind of pair into

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
caramelization just kind of pair into
slightly<00:01:30.150> smaller<00:01:30.299> segments<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> those<00:01:31.860> are

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
slightly smaller segments and those are

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
slightly smaller segments and those are
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> pan<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.720> get

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
going to go in the pan there we go get

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.460 
going to go in the pan there we go get
the<00:01:34.079> butter<00:01:34.229> nicely<00:01:35.060> frothing<00:01:36.380> forget<00:01:37.380> about

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the butter nicely frothing forget about

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
the butter nicely frothing forget about
those<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> second<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> tell<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730 
those for a second I'm going to tell you
a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.509> chicken<00:01:39.900> livers<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
a little bit about chicken livers I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
a little bit about chicken livers I
think<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> chicken<00:01:42.000> livers<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:43.259> very

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
think that chicken livers are very very

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.370 
think that chicken livers are very very
much<00:01:43.799> maligned<00:01:44.720> awful<00:01:45.720> people<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.170> quite

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
much maligned awful people get quite

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620

there's somewhere so stays warm I think
it's<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> bit<00:02:00.000> ambitious<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.510> all<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.720> means

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's a bit ambitious with all this means

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.150 
it's a bit ambitious with all this means
to<00:02:01.020> try<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.260> get<00:02:01.350> both<00:02:01.470> sides<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> pair
