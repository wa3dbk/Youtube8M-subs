00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.940
 facing goal 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.590
 if we use two dock zebras 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.570
 the white color in this case 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 the needles of number 8 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 of mill 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.100
 and the contractor must agree life already prepared could be 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.150
 that can take us to paperwork could do practices orchard 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.370
 directly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 it's easier inside another 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 let's do first 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.130
 the ecological debts of the start what is 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.230
 we click 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.310
 the two feet towards him and me 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.250
 we turn the work 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190
 if we enter 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.350
 the day behind 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.750
 of the uja 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.820
 with the thumb we hold the nail and with this 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.940
 from home that Moscow 8 laps we go eight goals one 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.950
 4 5 6 7 and 8 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.980
 we think 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 we go down 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 we loose a little hair 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 let's remember tera in super clean hands 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 we are in Iraq to the end with the omc with the nail 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.470
 we go we force towards it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.150
 and with this female 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.090
 stretch 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.660
 we have 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.890
 the first block 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.980
 let's go to the second 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.620
 which is exactly the same as the first 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.210
 we click 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.770
 we turn the work 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.270
 we put in stayed behind 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.180
 and at 8 2 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 4 5 6 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359
 7 and 8 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.719
 we go down 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.149
 we hold 100 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.709
 stretch again watching that the thread we go that inside 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.579
 we give with some 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.639
 starting little 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.969
 India 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 we wait for you the two of base 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.499
 and now let's do 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:32.770
 three ships 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.239
 surrounding 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.239
 at two of the 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.809
 we take out the 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.269
 above 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.459
 How are we going to do 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.749
 from here here and this journey is a hair 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 we're going to give ten laps 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.739
 um 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.909
 7 8 the 9 500 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.419
 we go down 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.139
 we hold 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.539
 and I already feel in crisis after turns 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.859
 we put ourselves 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 on the side 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.579
 we click 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 pull down to hold ac 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.230
 the second way that 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.789
 the need to appear 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.789
 a tad more back 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.299
 so that it opens a little 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.179
 to sin 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.679
 - up to this point 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.569
 kiko matamoros the journey is a tad more 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.369
 let's go 12 laps 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:45.159
 some 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:46.740
 we go down 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.999
 we hold and loosen 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 and stretch 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.409
 we got a little bit the way 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.839
 we click 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.849
 and finally 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.919
 we overlap a little too 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.849
 this the third petal 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.379
 coming out a little before 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.379
 and entering a little after the other 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 and that is that I put ducks 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.199
 about 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.520
 12 13 and 14 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.770
 we go down 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 we hold 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 and we puncture 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.680
 and here we have 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.249
 pretty flowers 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.330
 I hope that to finish 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.419
 nothing else to start 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.099
 another one and what a contrast 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.219
 for one hundred 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.629
 the city center 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.629
 who aspires to more 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.099
 against serbia 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.409
 the same 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.409
 eight laps 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.520
 eight more turns inside 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.589
 if it suits you 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.249
 a white paper a white fabric 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.229
 behind the hole 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.889
 to break him 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.939
 because if not novelis never 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.249
 head 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:47.699
 remember 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 despite the fact that he had the right that remains to be specified 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.360
 and more fair 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 in the middle 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.400
 tincho both 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.039
 delicately 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.039
 in the middle 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.990
 we place 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.949

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.470

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.289
 stretch 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.450
 and we just gave the touch of grace 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.450
 lessons 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.800
 myself site 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 if you see it very big eight eight six 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.919

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:41.520
 you can put the 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.270
 as many as you want 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.349

 aside 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.979
