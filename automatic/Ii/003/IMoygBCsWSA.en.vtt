00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello welcome to geneva 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.210
 every day the car monitor you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 offers the opportunity to discover a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.769
 car a novelty of this salon de 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.769
 Geneva Let's go everywhere for the samu 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.259
 we are in Switzerland so we are next to everything 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.060
 naturally a small citroen 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.270
 tribute to Switzerland is a good 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.989
 question about this citroen to us 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.430
 to answer them 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.410
 maybe a drum roll in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.329
 our two minds that can open the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.839
 envelopes but we'll see if you can 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:47.180
 answer the little question regarding 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:50.510
 this c1 citroen c1 for you a c1 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.000
 rather than invites canada is 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.720
 the same I do not know the 108 and the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.989
 ago what is at least y 'that c1 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.129
 so for me there is a possible answer 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.150
 there's only the c1 these moors answer 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.100
 the advantage of this little citroën 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.119
 it is customizable 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.430
 we can find it in version 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.020
 discoverable with three shades of fabric 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.150
 which are unavailable one can also 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.890
 juggle with him different colors and 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.530
 there we manipulate his colors as we 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.130
 wants 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.159
 second of the trio Peugeot 108 as his 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.140
 sister eh well she is customizable 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.100
 we can see here super things 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.619
 interesting is that they are 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 compatible with smartphones soon 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.070
 that we enter the cockpit and well 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 hop all we had in the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.360
 smartphone automatically goes into 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 the little machine not bad 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.810
 next to 108 peugeot we find yes 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 but yes, but you 're here to answer 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.320
 our little question puzzled question 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.350
 basically a trap we get along I'm going 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.689
 call melanie melanie please from monday 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.240
 who brings us a thank you very much 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.750
 see you later on 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.880
 the question 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 yes but I was open to envelop him 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.500
 and answer that question is what 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.720
 you can obviously read the question of 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
 the question regarding the 108 the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.229
 new Peugeot 908 and the question 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.160
 that's why a sequel rather than a 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.720
 it's one or an argos is all the same 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.100
 there I'll tell you yes and no yes this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.420
 a few steps away my car because 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.340
 peugeot has been working for years with 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 marcq seube and with toyota for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.420
 develop this little car in this 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.370
 segment really small city cars 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.049
 but it's not quite the same 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.269
 anyway because there is one of 3 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.160
 I think they embody the most this 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.860
 animal motion concept a kia this 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.090
 really touch peugeot and that without 8 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 some of them a little different 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.290
 reasons thank you yes 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.570
 number 3 of our trio after citroen 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.540
 c1 the Peugeot 108 here and the toyota 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.710
 aygo compared to the previous two 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.050
 notice that the front is 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.350
 much more original it changes that 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.520
 completely different from the other two 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.090
 koen it goes like this to the monitor 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.430
 automotive 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.770
 we have a little question for you I 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.370
 invite you to open this envelope 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.360
 we read 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.980
 the question is mostly to answer them 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 so toyota aygo 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 why inago rather than a c1 or 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.750
 that a 101.8 is the same ad 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.470
 is not the same it is a high alga 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.660
 it's different then why this 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.400
 study already has its 5 years warranty it's 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.590
 a customer service that is when 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.480
 even quite reputable and that's why 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.820
 also that the previous one had 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.120
 won such a big thank you very much 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.120

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.940
 like the previous version and as the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.680
 citroën 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.410

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.080

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.260
 we will go around ten thousand euros 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.950
 It's already over 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.390
