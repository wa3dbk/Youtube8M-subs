searching
it<00:02:04.870> was<00:02:04.960> Mandela<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.710> another<00:02:06.610> one<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.090> I

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
it was Mandela and another one that I

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.139 
it was Mandela and another one that I
was<00:02:07.950> considering<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.460> eventually<00:02:09.700> went

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
was considering but I eventually went

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.310 
was considering but I eventually went
from<00:02:10.270> Adela<00:02:10.509> because<00:02:10.720> when<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.899> was<00:02:10.990> asking

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
from Adela because when I was asking

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.930 
from Adela because when I was asking
around<00:02:11.440> everyone<00:02:12.340> said<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.670> should<00:02:12.850> get

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
around everyone said that I should get
the<00:02:13.030> Mandela<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:14.410> think<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.010> because

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the Mandela I think it's just because

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.100 
the Mandela I think it's just because
two<00:02:15.400> most<00:02:15.640> popular<00:02:16.060> everyone's<00:02:16.510> branded<00:02:16.960> but

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
two most popular everyone's branded but

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.470 
two most popular everyone's branded but
because<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.040> popular<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:18.880> easier<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
because it's so popular it's easier to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.000 
because it's so popular it's easier to
get<00:02:19.570> replacement<00:02:20.080> parts<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.470> ever<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.860> it

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
I also actually I'm not breastfeeding

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.580 
I also actually I'm not breastfeeding
anymore<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.510> actually<00:03:10.660> actually<00:03:11.200> bought

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
anymore and I actually actually bought

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.110 
anymore and I actually actually bought
another<00:03:12.220> tube<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.730> because<00:03:12.970> my<00:03:13.090> daughter

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
another tube of this because my daughter

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.270 
another tube of this because my daughter
has<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.810> lot<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.320> ice<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.680> monitor<00:03:14.920> her<00:03:15.040> hands

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
has a lot of ice to monitor her hands

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.590 
has a lot of ice to monitor her hands
and<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.489> don't<00:03:15.519> want<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> put<00:03:15.880> any<00:03:16.000> lotion<00:03:16.239> on

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and I don't want to put any lotion on

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.110 
and I don't want to put any lotion on
her<00:03:17.170> hands<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.220> use<00:03:18.610> this<00:03:18.790> instead<00:03:18.970> of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
her hands so I use this instead of

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.570 
her hands so I use this instead of
lotion<00:03:19.480> because<00:03:19.630> she<00:03:19.989> often<00:03:20.320> puts<00:03:20.739> her<00:03:21.310> hand

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
lotion because she often puts her hand

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.120 
lotion because she often puts her hand
in<00:03:21.850> her<00:03:22.030> mouth<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.230> actually<00:03:23.739> comes<00:03:23.920> in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
in her mouth so this actually comes in

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.860 
in her mouth so this actually comes in
handy<00:03:24.519> even<00:03:24.700> after<00:03:25.239> you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
handy even after you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.589 
handy even after you
finish<00:03:26.080> breastfeeding<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.370> next<00:03:27.909> so<00:03:28.450> that

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
finish breastfeeding the next so that

I put vaseline or petroleum jelly on her

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.460 
I put vaseline or petroleum jelly on her
to<00:04:06.760> protect<00:04:07.030> her<00:04:07.150> skin<00:04:07.299> she's<00:04:08.019> never<00:04:08.170> had<00:04:08.379> to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
to protect her skin she's never had to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.300 
to protect her skin she's never had to
be<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> rash<00:04:09.190> knock<00:04:09.549> on<00:04:09.700> wood<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:11.010> yeah<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.040> think

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
be a rash knock on wood and yeah I think

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.220 
be a rash knock on wood and yeah I think
that's<00:04:12.430> all<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.579> need<00:04:12.909> you<00:04:12.940> don't<00:04:13.180> need<00:04:13.299> you

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that's all you need you don't need you

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.379 
that's all you need you don't need you
don't<00:04:14.260> need<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.859> diaper<00:04:15.549> rash<00:04:15.670> cream<00:04:15.849> because

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
don't need a diaper rash cream because

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.479 
don't need a diaper rash cream because
the<00:04:16.690> whole<00:04:16.870> idea<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.530> prevent<00:04:17.889> diaper<00:04:18.190> rash

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
the whole idea is to prevent diaper rash

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.640 
the whole idea is to prevent diaper rash
and<00:04:18.789> this<00:04:19.359> definitely<00:04:19.720> does<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.109> hydrates<00:04:20.530> it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and this definitely does it hydrates it

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.890 
and this definitely does it hydrates it
and<00:04:20.799> protects<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.130> skin<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:22.449> don't<00:04:22.660> need

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and protects the skin and you don't need

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.770 
and protects the skin and you don't need
baby<00:04:23.289> wipes<00:04:23.590> because<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.520> don't<00:04:25.180> know<00:04:25.270> water

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
baby wipes because I don't know water

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.700 
baby wipes because I don't know water
water<00:04:26.440> will<00:04:26.800> completely<00:04:27.460> suffice<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:29.500> is

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
water will completely suffice so that is

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.629 
water will completely suffice so that is
ideal<00:04:30.010> for<00:04:30.039> three<00:04:30.520> item<00:04:31.450> number<00:04:31.720> four<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.639> a

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
ideal for three item number four is a

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.350 
ideal for three item number four is a
crib<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:35.610> technically<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.820> actually<00:04:37.180> don't

all four sides are the same height which

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920 
all four sides are the same height which
was<00:05:21.430> kind<00:05:21.699> of<00:05:21.789> actually<00:05:22.180> hard<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.479> find<00:05:22.660> most

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
was kind of actually hard to find most

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.200 
was kind of actually hard to find most
of<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.169> cribs<00:05:23.440> are<00:05:23.680> three<00:05:24.400> sizes<00:05:24.610> seam<00:05:24.970> and

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
of the cribs are three sizes seam and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.750 
of the cribs are three sizes seam and
then

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
then

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.930 
then
it<00:05:26.150> has<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.780> third<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.380> fourth<00:05:27.710> side<00:05:27.950> is<00:05:28.550> as<00:05:28.880> a

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
it has the third the fourth side is as a

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.000 
it has the third the fourth side is as a
high<00:05:29.150> back<00:05:29.420> which<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.230> didn't<00:05:30.470> really<00:05:30.650> want<00:05:30.860> I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
high back which I didn't really want I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.660 
high back which I didn't really want I
really<00:05:31.040> like<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:32.210> force<00:05:33.140> for<00:05:34.040> side<00:05:34.220> otherwise

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
really like the force for side otherwise

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.280 
really like the force for side otherwise
there's<00:05:34.940> like<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.270> lifestyle<00:05:35.720> whether<00:05:36.050> it's

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
there's like this lifestyle whether it's

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.280 
there's like this lifestyle whether it's
two<00:05:36.470> sides<00:05:36.710> are<00:05:36.890> higher<00:05:37.070> than<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.610> other<00:05:37.760> side

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
two sides are higher than the other side

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.800 
two sides are higher than the other side
but<00:05:39.290> I<00:05:40.060> didn't<00:05:41.060> really<00:05:41.240> want<00:05:41.390> that<00:05:41.450> either<00:05:41.690> I

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
but I didn't really want that either I

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.960 
but I didn't really want that either I
really<00:05:42.140> like<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.500> 360<00:05:42.830> now<00:05:43.280> her<00:05:43.460> crib<00:05:43.700> is<00:05:43.850> not

like that but I think I think no parent
should<00:06:30.080> be<00:06:30.290> okay<00:06:30.800> without<00:06:30.950> a<00:06:31.370> camera<00:06:32.270> and

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
should be okay without a camera and

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.940 
should be okay without a camera and
memory<00:06:33.740> card<00:06:34.010> and<00:06:34.630> those<00:06:35.630> are<00:06:35.960> my<00:06:36.170> five<00:06:36.650> baby
