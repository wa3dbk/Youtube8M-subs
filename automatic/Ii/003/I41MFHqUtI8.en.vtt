00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.849 
frets in and I thought I'd give you a
look<00:00:04.740> at<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.130> show<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.549> turned<00:00:05.759> out

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
look at and show you how it turned out

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
look at and show you how it turned out
once<00:00:07.859> again<00:00:08.360> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.570> material<00:00:10.050> I'm

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
once again this is the material I'm

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.890 
once again this is the material I'm
using<00:00:10.170> four<00:00:10.679> frets<00:00:11.480> stainless<00:00:12.480> steel<00:00:12.690> it's

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
using four frets stainless steel it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.709 
using four frets stainless steel it's
just<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.170> strip<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.500> comes<00:00:14.269> inside<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> set<00:00:15.630> of

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
just a strip that comes inside a set of

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.710 
just a strip that comes inside a set of
wiper<00:00:15.929> blades<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.119> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> leftover

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
wiper blades and this is a leftover

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.640 
wiper blades and this is a leftover
piece<00:00:19.640> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:20.820> where<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> cut<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.020> but

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
piece you can see where I cut it but

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.790 
piece you can see where I cut it but
anyway<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.970> after<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> shaped<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.590> earth

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.590 

once<00:00:33.219> you<00:00:33.340> get<00:00:33.460> all<00:00:33.640> your<00:00:33.670> frets<00:00:34.120> cut<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.480> the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
once you get all your frets cut to the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.229 
once you get all your frets cut to the
approximate<00:00:34.840> size<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:36.520> starters<00:00:36.940> on<00:00:37.120> this

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
approximate size for starters on this

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.350 
approximate size for starters on this
one's<00:00:37.449> gonna<00:00:37.570> be<00:00:37.660> 23<00:00:37.989> frets<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:39.969> need<00:00:40.120> to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
one's gonna be 23 frets then you need to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.540 
one's gonna be 23 frets then you need to
kind<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.230> give<00:00:41.410> them<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.530> little<00:00:41.710> profile<00:00:42.250> so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
kind of give them a little profile so

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.600 
kind of give them a little profile so
they're<00:00:42.670> rounded<00:00:43.149> on<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:43.300> edges<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:45.399> you<00:00:45.489> can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
they're rounded on the edges if you can

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.000 
they're rounded on the edges if you can
see<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:46.059> but<00:00:46.360> so<00:00:46.870> they're<00:00:47.110> rounded<00:00:47.469> a<00:00:47.559> bit<00:00:47.739> so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
see that but so they're rounded a bit so

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.799 
see that but so they're rounded a bit so
no<00:00:48.399> one's<00:00:48.550> gonna<00:00:48.610> like<00:00:48.820> catch<00:00:49.089> themselves<00:00:49.360> on

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
no one's gonna like catch themselves on

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.720 
no one's gonna like catch themselves on
the<00:00:49.900> edge<00:00:50.019> of<00:00:50.290> those<00:00:50.440> as<00:00:51.220> they're<00:00:51.400> moving<00:00:51.640> up

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
the edge of those as they're moving up

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.509 
the edge of those as they're moving up
and<00:00:51.820> down<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:51.970> neck<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:54.159> have<00:00:54.399> this

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
and down the neck so and I have this

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.579 
and down the neck so and I have this
very<00:00:54.909> fancy<00:00:55.420> high-tech<00:00:55.750> approach<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.409> doing

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
very fancy high-tech approach to doing

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.950 
very fancy high-tech approach to doing
that<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.100> I<00:00:57.519> will<00:00:57.699> show<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.909> as<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.629> can<00:00:58.750> see

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
something you can do this on a bench

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.430 
something you can do this on a bench
grinder<00:01:20.289> like<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:21.070> have<00:01:21.220> out<00:01:21.340> in<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.490> shed<00:01:22.440> but

grinder like we have out in the shed but

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.840 
grinder like we have out in the shed but
I<00:01:23.500> actually<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:24.039> doing<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.429> with<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.640> hand

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
I actually like doing it with the hand

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.480 
I actually like doing it with the hand
drill<00:01:25.000> because<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.600> can<00:01:25.929> modulate<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:27.159> speed

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
drill because I can modulate the speed

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.480 
drill because I can modulate the speed
of<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:28.380> despite<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.590> know<00:01:29.619> minutely<00:01:30.100> long

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
of it despite you know minutely long

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.969 
of it despite you know minutely long
doing<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:31.840> can<00:01:31.990> take<00:01:32.140> off<00:01:32.350> more<00:01:32.590> or<00:01:32.800> less

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
doing it so I can take off more or less

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.010 
doing it so I can take off more or less
depending<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.460> what<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.610> want<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.880> do<00:01:34.000> here<00:01:34.210> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
depending on what I want to do here and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.600 
depending on what I want to do here and
then<00:01:35.409> what<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.560> do<00:01:35.679> is<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.039> do<00:01:36.100> them<00:01:36.280> one<00:01:36.429> at<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
then what I do is I do them one at a

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.760 
then what I do is I do them one at a
time<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:37.149> I<00:01:37.240> actually<00:01:37.600> measure<00:01:37.869> them<00:01:38.110> to

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
time and then I actually measure them to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.679 
time and then I actually measure them to
the<00:01:38.950> fretboard<00:01:39.280> again<00:01:39.759> they<00:01:40.030> come<00:01:40.210> back<00:01:40.360> do<00:01:40.659> a

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
the fretboard again they come back do a

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.420 
the fretboard again they come back do a
little<00:01:40.840> bit<00:01:40.990> more<00:01:41.170> until<00:01:41.470> it's<00:01:41.619> like<00:01:41.770> perfect

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
little bit more until it's like perfect

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.870 
little bit more until it's like perfect
okay<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.420> all<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.020> do<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.409> you<00:01:45.159> know<00:01:45.280> hold

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
okay and all you do is a you know hold

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.000 
okay and all you do is a you know hold
like<00:01:46.060> so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.150 

I<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:54.400> kind<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.930> roll<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.440> onto<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:56.980> and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
I just kind of roll it onto there and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.400 
I just kind of roll it onto there and
that'll<00:01:58.030> give<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.690> don't<00:01:59.110> know<00:01:59.170> if<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.320> can

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
that'll give it I don't know if you can

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.500 
that'll give it I don't know if you can
see<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.950> or<00:02:00.250> but<00:02:00.820> it'll<00:02:01.000> give<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.360> nice

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
see that or but it'll give it a nice

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.660 
see that or but it'll give it a nice
rounded<00:02:01.990> profile<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.500> little<00:02:02.620> shoulder<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.460> it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
rounded profile a little shoulder on it

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.180 
rounded profile a little shoulder on it
okay<00:02:04.150> as<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.290> can<00:02:05.320> see<00:02:05.440> I've<00:02:05.680> got<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> bunch<00:02:06.010> of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
okay as you can see I've got a bunch of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.860 
okay as you can see I've got a bunch of
them<00:02:06.340> laid<00:02:06.490> here<00:02:06.790> that's<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.300> rough<00:02:07.600> cut

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
them laid here that's just rough cut

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.180 
them laid here that's just rough cut
ones<00:02:08.110> okay<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.530> can<00:02:11.650> see<00:02:11.830> it's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
ones okay and then you can see it's

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.010 
ones okay and then you can see it's
starting<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.490> get<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.820> rounded<00:02:13.270> profile<00:02:13.780> on

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
starting to get that rounded profile on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.140 
starting to get that rounded profile on
that<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> was<00:02:14.740> working<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:15.790> on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that one I was working on and then on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.570 
that one I was working on and then on
these<00:02:16.330> I've<00:02:17.080> actually<00:02:17.320> got<00:02:17.650> them<00:02:17.830> dry<00:02:18.130> fit<00:02:18.430> in

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
these I've actually got them dry fit in

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.400 
these I've actually got them dry fit in
there<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:21.210> right<00:02:22.210> now<00:02:22.360> it's<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.690> snug<00:02:23.080> fit<00:02:23.380> but

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.340 
there and right now it's a snug fit but
I<00:02:23.620> am<00:02:23.860> able<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.400> very<00:02:24.760> carefully<00:02:25.390> press<00:02:26.170> them

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
I am able to very carefully press them

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.070 
I am able to very carefully press them
down<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.710> there<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.840> take<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:28.990> little

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
down in there and I can take this little

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.510 
down in there and I can take this little
tool<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.830> actually<00:02:30.040> push<00:02:30.250> them<00:02:30.340> back

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
tool I have and actually push them back

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.280 
tool I have and actually push them back
out<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.940> then<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.540> actually<00:02:31.720> going<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.020> glue

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
out and then I'm actually going to glue

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.930 
out and then I'm actually going to glue
them<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.710> tap<00:02:32.950> them<00:02:33.190> into<00:02:33.340> place<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:33.820> it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
them and tap them into place when it's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.940 
them and tap them into place when it's
all<00:02:34.060> final<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:35.140> as<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.560> see<00:02:35.740> they're

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
all final but as you can see they're

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.910 
all final but as you can see they're
already<00:02:36.130> starting<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.640> look<00:02:36.820> pretty<00:02:37.570> nice<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
already starting to look pretty nice you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
already starting to look pretty nice you
can<00:02:39.070> see<00:02:39.190> each<00:02:39.280> one<00:02:39.490> has<00:02:39.700> nice<00:02:39.880> rounded<00:02:40.270> little

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
can see each one has nice rounded little

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.260 
can see each one has nice rounded little
corners<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.110> everything<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.030> then

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
corners and everything and and then

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.360 
corners and everything and and then
actually<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.720> will<00:02:44.200> install<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.980> glue<00:02:45.160> all

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually I will install and glue all

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.610 
actually I will install and glue all
these<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.720> then<00:02:46.959> I'll<00:02:47.050> come<00:02:47.260> back<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
these in and then I'll come back and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.590 
these in and then I'll come back and
finish<00:02:47.860> saying<00:02:48.220> my<00:02:48.430> neck<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.300> way<00:02:49.480> if

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
finish saying my neck and that way if

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.060 
finish saying my neck and that way if
there's<00:02:49.780> anything<00:02:50.050> sticking<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.770> at<00:02:50.950> all

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
there's anything sticking out at all

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.650 
there's anything sticking out at all
which<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.459> see<00:02:51.610> there's<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:52.209> very<00:02:52.240> much

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
which you can see there's not very much

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.199 
which you can see there's not very much
you<00:02:53.020> know<00:02:53.350> if<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.830> any<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.850> if<00:02:54.940> there<00:02:55.060> is

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
you know if there is any but if there is

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.020 
you know if there is any but if there is
it'll<00:02:55.600> be<00:02:55.720> sanded<00:02:56.140> smooth<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:57.760> way<00:02:57.880> will

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
it'll be sanded smooth and that way will

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.430 
it'll be sanded smooth and that way will
feel<00:02:58.180> real<00:02:58.390> nice<00:02:58.570> when<00:02:58.780> you're<00:02:58.930> playing<00:02:59.140> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
feel real nice when you're playing and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.520 
feel real nice when you're playing and
everything<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.910> after<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> shape<00:03:02.260> them<00:03:02.500> and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
everything so after I shape them and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.780 
everything so after I shape them and
everything<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.160> showed<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> last

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
everything like I showed you in the last

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.259 
everything like I showed you in the last
segment<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.650> laid<00:03:05.650> them<00:03:05.800> all<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.370> here<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
segment I laid them all out in here and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.340 
segment I laid them all out in here and
they<00:03:07.870> are<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.489> glued<00:03:09.489> down<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.209> set<00:03:10.959> up<00:03:11.140> and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
they are all glued down and set up and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.670 
they are all glued down and set up and
everything<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.480> leveled<00:03:13.480> out<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.470> should

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
everything and leveled out and it should

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.820 
everything and leveled out and it should
be<00:03:14.830> good<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.130> go<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.760> now<00:03:16.600> after<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.590> strung

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
be good to go and now after it's strung

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.410 
be good to go and now after it's strung
up<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.160> everything<00:03:18.430> if<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.670> find<00:03:18.910> out<00:03:19.090> there<00:03:19.300> is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
up and everything if I find out there is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.630 
up and everything if I find out there is
a<00:03:19.450> high<00:03:19.630> spot<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.290> there<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:21.250> course<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
a high spot here and there of course I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.520 
a high spot here and there of course I
could<00:03:21.850> file<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.269> down<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.450> little<00:03:22.660> bit<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.290> make

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
could file it down a little bit and make

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.220 
could file it down a little bit and make
them<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.370> know<00:03:24.430> perfect<00:03:24.940> but<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.200> can

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
them you know perfect but and you can

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.759 
them you know perfect but and you can
see<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.650> looking<00:03:26.769> pretty<00:03:27.070> good<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:28.769> said

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
see it's looking pretty good I said

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.870 
see it's looking pretty good I said
there<00:03:29.920> could<00:03:30.100> still<00:03:30.220> be<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.489> little<00:03:30.580> bit<00:03:30.730> of

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
there could still be a little bit of

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.430 
there could still be a little bit of
finishing<00:03:31.180> work<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:31.959> when<00:03:32.320> you're

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
finishing work just like when you're

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.050 
finishing work just like when you're
doing<00:03:32.650> regular<00:03:32.980> frets<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.610> same<00:03:33.820> way

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
doing regular frets it's the same way

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.250 
doing regular frets it's the same way
you<00:03:34.120> still<00:03:34.480> have<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.660> work<00:03:34.840> them<00:03:34.989> over<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
you still have to work them over a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.280 
you still have to work them over a
little<00:03:35.380> bit<00:03:35.650> once<00:03:36.340> ever<00:03:36.550> things<00:03:36.790> together<00:03:37.290> but

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
little bit once ever things together but

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.400 
little bit once ever things together but
turned<00:03:39.040> out<00:03:39.190> pretty<00:03:39.340> nice<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.910> think

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
turned out pretty nice I think

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.620 
turned out pretty nice I think
especially<00:03:41.410> for<00:03:41.680> using<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.400> material<00:03:43.300> that's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
especially for using a material that's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.449 
especially for using a material that's
not<00:03:43.720> intended<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.290> guitars<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:47.459> that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
not intended for guitars so but now that
