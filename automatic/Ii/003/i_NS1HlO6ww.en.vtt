00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.500
 hello good compaÃ±eras companies and 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.790
 Well, here I bring you a new video 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.890
 on how to make a record of 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.020
 system recovery is worth this 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.310
 works with windows 7 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.790
 ok and to do this simply 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.550
 we should go to the beginning and we put rec 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.529
 disk true here does not come a little program 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 we give to enter opens this 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.899
 program you have everything is always 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.730
 comes default and here we have 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.490
 to select a slot that we have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 I only have one 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.220
 where are we going to record a CD or DVD worth 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.990
 I recommend dvd in case we are missing 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.120
 so there's no shortage of space 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.050
 but yes 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.870
 if you do not have, you can explore with you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.000
 well we have to put a dvd n in the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.730
 slot and when we had already got it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
 we have to give it to create disk worth 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.880
 this process a little long, I'm going to 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.810
 accelerate and 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.630
 while I say that is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.370
 of system repair what is going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.260
 to do is to help us when we have 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.640
 problems when the computer goes bad 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.610
 we have something that fails not to start 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.630
 example or leave some mistake we put this 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.310
 recovery or repair disk and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.040
 following the steps helps us fix 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.210
 or to solve the errors is a disk 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.370
 that we should always have on hand 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.910
 sometimes they even come to buy 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.170
 the computer come in the box other 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.910
 Sometimes it does not come, you do not have to do it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.400
 but it is just that easy 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.880
 put a disc and open this simple 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.280
 the installer, well, I'm going to accelerate 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 ok because this is a bit long 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.720
 accelerate and we go back 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.009
 good since you do not get message already says 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.810
 that we put a label or that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.220
 put some name is worth so they know 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.330
 What is it 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.120
 and we just close we accept it and already 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.940
 our done 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.319
 our record is good, well, this is 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.390
 everything or I tell you that this album is very very 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.670
 useful then I recommend that all 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.459
 you have it even for security to 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.870
 when you know that some mistake you can 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.140
 use at any time now yes 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.360
 that guards jce and you have it in a 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.680
 site one per computer is worth it because each 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.030
 disk is different depending on the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.640
 operating system and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 and of the requirements, well, this is 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.050
 It's all I hope to have helped if it's like that 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.420
 subscribe give us like so that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.870
 keep uploading new videos and this is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 all 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.290
 goodbye 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.350

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 yes
