network utility and first we're going to
look<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.649> private<00:00:38.280> example<00:00:38.879> comm<00:00:39.210> to

look up that private example comm to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
look up that private example comm to
make<00:00:39.570> sure<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.469> good<00:00:40.800> IP<00:00:41.190> address

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
make sure that we get a good IP address

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990 
make sure that we get a good IP address
for<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.649> we<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> IP

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
for it and we do we see that the IP

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
for it and we do we see that the IP
address<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:47.600> 192.168.1<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> try<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
address is 192.168.1 I'm going to try to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
address is 192.168.1 I'm going to try to
ping<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.210> private<00:00:52.039> example.com<00:00:53.039> website<00:00:54.079> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
ping the private example.com website and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
ping the private example.com website and
it<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:55.739> take<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.789> will

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it will take a little bit but we will

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
it will take a little bit but we will
eventually<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.350> no<00:00:58.800> response

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
eventually see that there is no response

it does take a little while I'll click
on<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.990> show<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.950> doesn't<00:01:17.220> load

immediately but it takes it about a

immediately but it takes it about a
minute<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.590> timeout<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
minute to timeout so we're not going to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.830 
minute to timeout so we're not going to
wait<00:01:21.060> around<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.540> that
