00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
showed three of them well then I

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.870 
showed three of them well then I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
research and there's like 15 up there so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000 
research and there's like 15 up there so
some<00:04:18.150> reason<00:04:18.479> not<00:04:18.989> everything<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.530> listed
