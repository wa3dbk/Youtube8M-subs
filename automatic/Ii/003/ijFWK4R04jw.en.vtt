00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello to everyone as promised yet how easy and 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.510
 just do something on the car 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.660
 helpful today wanted to tell about 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.430
 running when you didn't want to do long ago 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.260
 because basically how would such 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.810
 an accessory that is useful because 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.119
 it will come out even if that day is where 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.590
 such a rain comes that is a machine with 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.500
 additional lights are better seen 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.509
 Mirrors therefore wanted to do for a long time 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.330
 I wanted to do as simply based on that 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.310
 what is already on the car with the smallest 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.660
 alterations and so she doesn't 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.219
 bother that it was not 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.140
 some buttons separately including 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:44.539
 do automate this process 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.309
 Of course the guests running should not 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.170
 work a little differently like me 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.629
 did because they have to turn off 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.199
 when you turn on both rites or near 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.910
 headlights 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.539
 that is, I don’t have one in principle 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.120
 burn constantly and how the engine works 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.469
 and when you turn on my light I did 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.760
 as I stood in staff 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.710
 fog light bulb there already 3 I 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.009
 just died in china ordered half 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.680
 dollar led light bulbs 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.540
 it means diode each bulb pulls on 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.920
 one and a half wool, that is, principle two 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.810
 bulbs 3rd so you can not 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.020
 bother never turn off then 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.509
 have they work all the time all the time 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
 when the car runs on gas i 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.159
 came from that if you feel ashamed 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.790
 for the balloon and equipment when you 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.189
 go in there gas is fed 12 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.360
 volt to the valve that opens the flow 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.100
 gas means I took it from there because 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.890
 I like to read other methods on the Internet 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.009
 there the sea is advised to take there with a relay 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.659
 gasoline pump or with some other kind 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.880
 things well, I don’t want to eat 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.649
 standard wiring is not something to change something 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 there is a principle as it looked looked 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.140
 what is the most safe thing to do 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.700
 gas supply from valve 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.180
 counter tumanki I already stood I 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 live light bulbs changed mean mass 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.660
 You can take, in principle, one of the lamps 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.640
 dim light or where to find 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.160
 actually I take 12 volts 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 stretched the wire means I am a deal 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.140
 provodochek which went from protivotumanok 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.970
 here it means where the shield 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.640
 I started the fuse bottom 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 neatly and got the wire here 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 usual 2 075 ball screws tied one 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.000
 Contact me and put in a break 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.700
 the fuse in FIG of them is already counter 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 tumanki are at the bottom if you call there 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.510
 in u it may have a deep puddle yet 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.090
 somewhere means you teach 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.880
 the fuse in the circuit of this bolt and on 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.820
 wire can be simply laid as convenient 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 there under the engine allows and 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.130
 hold it to the gas pressure valve 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 I also wrapped the wire 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.040
 tape all over the entire length because 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.709
 what kind of insulation is there 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 good well, you never know where it will go 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.250
 the car is moving to while riding there 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.280
 about water day and frayed they are not in 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 what's the clamps and only bracket it 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.930
 He shook his tape as it safely and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.560
 further the second end of the wire means 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.079
 connects here we see the gas valve 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.930
 which opens and here is our wire 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.440
 took this posting took off this mount 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 clip itself carefully wound the clip here 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.510
 wiring 2 connected and in place 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.700
 set now it turns out it means when 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.709
 we turn us on valve served 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.239
 voltage is 12 volts and automatically 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.730
 fog turns on then of course 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.860
 if you have gas equipment then this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.360
 the method will not work for you and if there is something in 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.360
 In principle, I believe that this is the most 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.350
 safe best way to find 12 volts 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.500
 it is under the hood thank you for your attention 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.209
 watch our videos will shoot more 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.450
 Now I took a new machine, therefore 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.160
 We will learn how to do it yourself 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.769
 anti-corrosion treatment 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.450
 liquid fenders to change the rack all 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.650
 the rest see subscribe 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.650
 goodbye
