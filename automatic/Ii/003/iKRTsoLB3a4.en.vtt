00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.250
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.630
 welcome to a new video in the video 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.430
 today I am going to propose you again a 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.559
 dinner with friends or with tim you want 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.510
 invite home you will remember a video 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.010
 that I proposed to do something similar but 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.240
 this time it comes with changes in the first 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.710
 place we're going to do it on the terrace 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.619
 because it takes more I have now my terrace 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.539
 its redecorated opening and we're going to 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.850
 make a snacking dinner before to 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.500
 do these pecking if I'm going to use 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.090
 canned food obviously those that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.100
 have more time than you want you can 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.989
 know the vegetables but good I what 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.089
 what I want in these videos about everything is 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.250
 that the lack of time is not an excuse 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.960
 so as not to prepare this type of plans, 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.420
 and you are overcome not some preserves 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.400
 because there is no excuse or complaint 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.500
 we're not going to start with that first 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.470
 pecking that are basically 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.299
 Mushroom triangles with lacquer 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.489
 ingredients that you are going to need are 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:01:00.670
 chives garlic tender mushrooms cream 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.160
 to cook sheets of egg brick for 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.350
 decorate pepper 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.950
 we eat the mushrooms 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 little ones in a pan we put oil 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.900
 of olive we toss the chopped onion and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 we also leave chopped garlic 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.070
 continue to simmer 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.490
 once it is golden we will throw the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.450
 sautÃ© mushrooms well you 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 add salt and grind black pepper 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.140
 finally we add the cream also 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.550
 you can add that we mix it 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.800
 all right 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.570
 the next thing is to make the triangles 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.910
 using vine leaves be careful 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.040
 because they are very finite leaves and can be 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.620
 break easily with a knife 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.210
 let's make four cuts the curves 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.100
 from the extremes we will not be able to 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.380
 use for this dish on one of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.440
 the strips place a spoonful of the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.230
 mix the tip up you take it and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 you take it down this other point 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.560
 up forming a triangle is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.040
 another tip down we bend one more 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.470
 and we ended up with the help of a 15 and of 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.149
 beaten egg we closed that little triangle and 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.830
 He also threw a little above 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.350
 of egg so that it stays golden when 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.560
 we put it in the oven we repeat once 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.560
 plus 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.400
 when you have all the triangles 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.230
 place them on a ready source 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.760
 meteis oven and baked until 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.860
 be golden 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.870
 My second proposal today are 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 breaded artichokes this is a recipe 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.739
 that I do not know if I knew before or the retro 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.720
 rediscover the other day when I was in 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.159
 Barcelona's book signing results 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.510
 that this is the signature I 'm going to have dinner 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.280
 with some friends and they take out some 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.900
 artichokes enjoyed as crispy 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.849
 super rich and then I was engaged in 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.799
 home try to replicate that recipe because 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.420
 it seemed very simple and quite 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.120
 healthy so these are the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.849
 ingredients that you are going to need 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.980
 artichokes cornstarch and enough salt 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.870
 they take the artichokes and those that are 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 you can divide them by the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.829
 half if they are small you do not have to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 the courts because those are going to undo and 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.639
 they will be very small 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.980
 add it is enough salt over 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.650
 We put oil to heat we pass the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 artichokes for cornstarch and egg and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.790
 we put to the fire it is important that the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.190
 fire is very hot we follow the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.260
 process of cornstarch and egg with the rest 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.079
 of the artichokes we are taking them out and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.639
 we let them drain between skewer and 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.230
 skewer let's go fixing we'll go 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.060
 to be to do these waves pretty 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.099
 I teach them to you in detail 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.049
 in a video that I made special for you and 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.540
 that I shared on my blog but well I do not know 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.790
 if you saw it all with what today 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.620
 quickly teach the technique 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.329
 you basically have to divide the hair 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.829
 in sections and you start working 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.540
 bottom parts as I'm going to teach you 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.430
 those above but I'm going to jump 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.680
 this step to go a little more to the grain 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.420
 basically it consists of rolling each 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 one of the strands in different 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.620
 senses is to say ones for outside and the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.239
 next to in first 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.920
 I put on some gloves because if not 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.900
 I assure you that you are going to burn and I use 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.000
 is styler that in particular is called sun 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.950
 fire and it's the brand and resistive mine 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.349
 we are removing the hair strands for 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.480
 work and apply them first 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.040
 the protective heat spray I grab the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.049
 strand closer to the face and what 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.510
 rolled out with tyler what 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.609
 let act 15 seconds we take the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.400
 next tuft and we rolled it towards 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.139
 in it we let it act and so we continue 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.949
 with all the strands and so that you 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.599
 last a little longer 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.609
 the final hairstyle we simply apply 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.190
 a little bit of the song will keep the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.599
 curls for longer we go back 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.250
 with food and now I'm going to teach you 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.780
 a couple of salads because when 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.759
 So good weather starts and above all 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.289
 a terrace talk like a lot 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.419
 take salads the first of the 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.400
 Salads is one that I usually make 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.180
 parents a lot in summer is very simple 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 the ingredients 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.300
 is that you are going to need are potatoes 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.120
 leeks egg oil vinegar and salt 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.490
 we cook the potato and remove the skin 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.620
 We cut it into slices then into a 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.300
 pretty fountain we place the slices 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.580
 following some circles 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.190
 On the other hand, we take the towns and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.289
 we start in smaller cylinders no 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.570
 very small so that they do not fall apart 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.570
 We are placing on the potato making 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.030
 a nice drawing now let's make a 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.220
 vinaigrette crushed the hard boiled egg until 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.160
 that is well minced the following is 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.340
 add the vinegar and salt oil 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.250
 we stir well 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.870
 if you have parsley, add it too and 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.910
 the last salad that is one of my 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.350
 favorite is the russian salad plus 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.270
 recently discovered these 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.740
 vegetable macedonian compounds that 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.910
 I've done it that way, it's very easy 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.470
 do let's start with the 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.199
 ingredients before overtaking me that 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.680
 they are vegetable macedonia boiled eggs 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.510
 tuna oil vinegar and salt in a bowl 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.970
 big we toss the vegetables 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.949
 next we add the tuna what 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.030
 next thing we do is chop the egg 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.030
 that we have previously known 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.930
 finally we add mayonnaise I have 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.610
 made a homemade because I love it but 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.770
 you can take a boat if you do not have 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.840
 weather 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.160
 now we have to put the nice table in 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.139
 this occasion chosen a tablecloth 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.759
 superchulo that I bought in Portugal and 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.610
 Of course a nice table has to go 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.470
 always with some vases of flowers 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.150
 you notice in these cars milestones of some 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.349
 little details of glitter that really 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.300
 it's very easy to do, I'm going to 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.490
 teach you are going to need some jars of 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.620
 crystal and nail lacquer lacquer 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.419
 nails that have glitter the process 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.400
 It's as simple as painting 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.650
 jars with devil's nail lacquer 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.240
 it's easy not once we have the jar 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370
 painted we can finish the lid 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.440
 adding a little detail in another color 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.310
 This is the result of the two boats 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.789
 decorated we take a bouquet and we're going to 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.190
 divide in two we trimmed the stems 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:37.130
 and we put them in the jars you will be left 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.990
 so bright we can also use 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.500
 the mushroom jars as a holder 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.990
 candles we have a little detail more in 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.729
 our table and now we only have to serve 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.380
 the table we take one hand the 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.569
 Russian salad that is super 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.639
 appetizing we continue with the following 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.400
 pecking on the one hand the artichokes 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.200
 crunchy on the other the triangles of 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.240
 mushrooms that you see the pint that has 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.420
 once they are golden brown and finally 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.100
 the potato salad and leeks if 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.180
 you want me to tell you we have the table 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.160
 ready for our guests 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.930
 I will quickly show you the look that 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.670
 I would choose for an occasion like this always 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.740
 da for choosing white I do not know why to 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.450
 this type of celebrations but I like 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.670
 I think it brings a lot of clarity 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.040
 this pretty simple dress and that 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.810
 yes a nice flat shoe plated but 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.250
 flat to try to run from here 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.410
 from there to the kitchen for the terrace 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.240
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.130
 have you liked please for little fingers 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.660
