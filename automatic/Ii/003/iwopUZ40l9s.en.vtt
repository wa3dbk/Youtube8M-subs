00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.779
 hi girls and a lot in this new one 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.800
 video I finally came back to do the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.040
 video 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.660
 I was missing for two or three weeks before 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.809
 christmas anyway i missed because if 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.189
 follow me on facebook with the wise person 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.290
 use of weapons with the Hon 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.290
 so I wanted some time with 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 he recharged his batteries and 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.109
 anyway I finally came back with a 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.370
 makeup tutorial and this time decided 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.899
 to do a trick inspired by demi lovato 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.149
 just a little fixed with demi lovato e 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.480
 I really like this period 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.280
 his songs and I follow her a lot and find her 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.739
 be a beautiful girl and me 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.839
 she really likes her friend she team 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.540
 very different tricks on occasion 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.479
 but I think one of his signs 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.270
 badges is this eyeliner line 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.800
 also quite thick false eyelashes 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.079
 perfect base that day a lot of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.850
 lips had decided to go for a 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.409
 minute because I was inspired by 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.680
 spelling where she had it 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.540
 these lips completely shot 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.149
 I like the end result 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.140
 if you want other videos of this kind 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.520
 put I like it so I know you have 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.219
 welcome this video so i will 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.539
 I will repeat others and leave you there 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.149
 also a commentary because we liked it 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.799
 as long as I said why it does to me 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.329
 always nice to read your comments 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.070
 see you next hello video 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.759
 we immediately start from the base and I apply 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.340
 the foundation of the ananas the share blog is 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.079
 became my favorite foundation 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.869
 I love finding it perfect especially if 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.789
 you have a dry skin that brightens 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.600
 the face is grateful in a way 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.929
 crazy then went to the concealer and 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.940
 use the ryan crimi always advise 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.120
 in the mass that this is a corrector 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.950
 fantastic super mega covering and also 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 super mega illuminante in fact me 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.180
 use not only to correct it 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:35.959
 chiaie but also to illuminate 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 her face draws her eyebrows with 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.030
 the pencil of our self in beverly 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.650
 hills 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
 I believe this is the product for the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.519
 subtractions at best I've ever had 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.040
 used in my whole life is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.829
 really a fantastic pencil and there 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.109
 advice and does not cost much 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.090
 placed around schoolchildren than with the 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.400
 change then does not become a figure 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.579
 exorbitant but really a product 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.409
 fantastic that I recommend for the 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.959
 eyes today we will use the naked tre 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.760
 of urban decay starts by applying su 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.799
 all the mobile eyelid up to below 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.889
 the arc brow the color more 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.889
 clear 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.990
 I call myself the crease of my eye 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.000
 applying an opaque antique pink I apply 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.220
 the color with a brush in the language of 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.560
 cat then I go to blend it 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.200
 with a gradient brush and then I go 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.060
 areas apply it and hare blend it until 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.540
 I'm not happy with the intensity of the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.540
 color 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.260
 and we arrived at my moment 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.730
 preferred ie the application 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.070
 of the eyeliner this time but we will have to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.530
 draw a fairly thick line the 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.630
 advice I give you and start 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.240
 dashing the thin line and go 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.130
 there then to thicken slowly not 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.709
 draw a thick line directly 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.630
 otherwise you will almost certainly combine 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.790
 a trouble i have to say this is liner 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
 behrami capri volution really is 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.510
 bad I'm using it because I don't want to 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.000
 throw it but it's really really 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.090
 bad and I don't recommend it for having 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.890
 of eyes enslaved like those of 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.240
 demi lovato surely cannot 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.720
 miss fake eyelashes 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.970
 I'm going to apply these that are 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.090
 quite dramatic I must say and then 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.060
 I'm going to combine my natural eyelashes with 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.740
 the fake ones by applying just a little 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.710
 mascara and I'm using the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.390
 greenstream of the furniture in which I am 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.890
 finding it pretty good especially 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.420
 now that the product inside is 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.630
 a little annoyed because the beginning was 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.840
 really really liquid and I really did 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.370
 difficulty applying the heat 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.150
 to the complexion with a little bit of earth e 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.950
 this is a duo of uai with which he was a 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.680
 limited edition so I don't think that 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.930
 be more available but you can like it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.300
 use any browser you have 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.830
 and then I go to do some highlighting 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.870
 using this illuminant 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.110
 of the friend 3 volution that instead me 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.270
 really like it and speed advice 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.110
 it costs very little but lights up in one 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.110
 crazy way 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.730
 trace the contour of the lips with 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.080
 this pencil of her colors and I must say 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.660
 that I was pleasantly surprised 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.730
 from this brand because it has products 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.500
 especially the very pro line very much 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.870
 valleys and very cheap unfortunately not 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.940
 found in italy but online maybe 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.160
 you will be able to find it I apply the 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.080
 lipstick I use big news from 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.310
 mac and then I go to blend the two colors 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.220
 together since the pencil is 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.650
 slightly darker I apply as a touch 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.330
 final a catch blush and make up 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.130
 finished boy I hope you are me 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.060
 liked if it were left as one 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.010
 comment 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.270
 put me like the video we'll see you 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.270
 in the next hello
