00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 yes servus people welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.810
 back to the crysis 3 beta playing tart 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.570
 on the map we already seen 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.010
 have in hunter mode is a very 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 We want to have a cool map again 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.630
 many facets and they have sometimes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.940
 nice this hot slide seen the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 one also from crysis 2 I think has 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 one skillfully and also the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 first you have seen so before 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 this rammer from the air that are so 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.529
 small gimmicks that you can use too 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 an opponent when you're behind me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.320
 Oberin is or bam door on and out 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 but median I have a try 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 blown up the hip and get none 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.030
 then ever nate and somehow was 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.360
 that's nothing at the beginning it is 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 of course very difficult times 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.170
 to get the control straight when you get it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.870
 not used to it 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.070
 I'll say the usual call of duty 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.230
 player is of course very, very 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.699
 otherwise you are used to the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 environment look what are the two doing 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.239
 collegues hey people off we go 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 you have to go on stealth mode 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.479
 Let's go if of course as a call 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.970
 of duty veterans I say through the times 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 bredouille rides, so to speak 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.020
 Of course, quite different one gets used to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.210
 Crysis 3 with heaps of explosions 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.580
 pure realism and it is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.080
 Just what something you have to like that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.470
 I have to say very clearly at the place 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.000
 if you are a fan of the series you will 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.740
 Do not be disappointed , especially the pc 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.409
 player then definitely not this time 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.479
 disappointed it was personal to me as yes 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.710
 How should I say 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.180
 second pc player I am yes 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 mainly xbox game but I want 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 Of course, also very happy on the pc 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 because you just hold this performance 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.079
 can rausholen times 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 which is really in such a game 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.159
 and you have to stop just once 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.649
 admitted as xbox or ps3 gambler 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.890
 People take you to the times 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.800
 throat 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.780
 and say no fun grasp yourself 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.760
 make the nose is called the verdict sums 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.229
 look at them and just say at the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:09.280
 put yes crysis 3 belongs to the pc and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 the pc can only afford what crysis 3 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.350
 at 1 am a graphic wonder is so 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.200
 The thing really looks really cool 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.820
 you will see out of us if we are 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.530
 I'll tell you when I get that 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.090
 upload singleplayer times 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 because we were allowed to with mission 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.020
 captain and I also like you 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.310
 present 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.410
 and I would be happy 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.200
 of course what he says because there is 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.970
 the graphic with full resolution the capt 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.280
 I think you can see it in the same way 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 multiplayer the quality should be here 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.880
 also be good i have extra at 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.730
 render this time care that 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.560
 go full quality pump go 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.540
 that's really cool here 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.780
 let the developers out we have 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.420
 as seen in frankfurt as well as there 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 It does not work on such a game 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.390
 just so you push two three 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.550
 buttons and suddenly there is such a book 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.760
 emerged but then had too 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.650
 Consider how the bus is like blowing 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.720
 because the bush in the wind something in the a for 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.310
 light effects et cetera and I have me 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.290
 That can not be serious I have 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.150
 that looked like again there is one 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.160
 animation i made for one 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 puddle and then you had to first 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.660
 choose which shadow reflections 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.489
 So in the puddle I think so 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.890
 alone if you sit a game and 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.930
 takes 20 minutes 0 for a puddle 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.630
 then I think so can 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.430
 really graphically just really good 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.380
 and now meet here a yes 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.799
 and of course that is not 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.239
 bad 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.620
 I say I tried one 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.880
 we'll show you everything so 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.620
 I think I play the same way 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.959
 short with the sniper if not me 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.910
 everything is wrong but you have to go to the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.840
 Of course, say it is easy 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.090
 won 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.860
 I do not want to say it is 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.630
 habitual thing but it is I think 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.680
 already eckhard habit you have to 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.080
 first get used to it 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.340
 to play this game again it works 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.110
 even if you shot down one 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.100
 you have to have these art dog tags again 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.450
 the left will pick up and 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.490
 the mode we are playing right now 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.490
 is a kind of combination of team 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.770
 deathmatch and domination so you have 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.510
 a point on the map you can see 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.610
 I believe now down here in 40 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.650
 meters where I have to run right now 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.070
 then hold and accordingly so too 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.900
 a kind of 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.549
 I do not want to say capture the flag 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.840
 is not that not because it is not that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.880
 it has to get some flag too 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 no domination because you do not flag 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.960
 that he did not say that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.430
 but such a kind of erhard point would 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.160
 but say so king of the hill 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.930
 You know that from the old ones 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.420
 cs time still there was this game mode 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.670
 actually very often now say that 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.170
 fat was unpacked then I think 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.570
 something can break something I've got 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.760
 The change and raider brought what I 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.560
 So I just wanted to say yes 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120
 These tags are running around his 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.910
 to get a conclusion series 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.250
 one knows from crysis 2 there was one 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.590
 some cool he statements in here 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.230
 drone and then this fat organ 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 strike from above that was already a crysis 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.040
 2 really fat what is there to effect ballerei 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.250
 was operated 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.660
 why i caught you good question 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.360
 I do not know why I died 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.190
 But I'm on the spot just have to 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.960
 The game itself is said to be playing 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.670
 Take a look at it and 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.290
 Of course, also likes to write in the 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.660
 comments what you think of the game itself 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.550
 hold and then I would have said dazzle 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.500
 here at the place was enough to 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.480
 hope you enjoyed it until the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.480
 next time different juul servus
