thing fingers through it and just kind
of<00:02:43.650> kind<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.940> back<00:02:45.300> around<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.810> outside<00:02:46.260> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
of kind of go back around the outside of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.550 
of kind of go back around the outside of
itself<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> grab<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:48.230> pull<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
itself and grab it and pull up like a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.090 
itself and grab it and pull up like a
loop<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.460> okay<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.800> then<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:52.950> just

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
loop like this okay and then you're just

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.050 
loop like this okay and then you're just
gonna<00:02:53.310> feed<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.900> nozzle<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.380> your<00:02:55.500> balloon

whether the mylar paper should all be

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.940 
whether the mylar paper should all be
cut<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> exactly<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.170> same<00:03:22.200> size<00:03:22.680> or

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
different sizes or whatever personally I

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.650 
different sizes or whatever personally I
kind<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.430> them<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.210> little

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
kind of like them a little bit a little

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.180 
kind of like them a little bit a little
bit<00:03:27.780> different<00:03:28.110> sizes<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:28.950> gives<00:03:29.070> it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
bit different sizes I think it gives it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.470 
bit different sizes I think it gives it
kind<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.520> neat<00:03:29.640> texture<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.150> then<00:03:30.210> I<00:03:30.330> can

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
kind of a neat texture and then I can

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
kind of a neat texture and then I can
always<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.110> trim<00:03:31.350> whatever<00:03:32.040> didn't

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430

line<00:03:32.640> up<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.000> way<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.300> wanted<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.990> so

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
line up the way that I wanted it to so

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.530 
line up the way that I wanted it to so
you're<00:03:35.100> gonna<00:03:35.190> put<00:03:35.430> your<00:03:35.580> papers<00:03:35.940> down<00:03:36.240> and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
you're gonna put your papers down and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.940 
you're gonna put your papers down and
you<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.080> want<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.260> make<00:03:37.350> like<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> star

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
you kind of want to make like a star

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.880 
you kind of want to make like a star
formation<00:03:38.640> kind<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:38.970> kind<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.690> fan<00:03:39.960> them<00:03:40.230> so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
formation kind of kind of fan them so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.010 
formation kind of kind of fan them so
that<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.310> usually<00:03:41.580> put<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:41.970> first<00:03:42.360> two<00:03:42.630> down<00:03:42.810> so

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
that I usually put my first two down so

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.070 
that I usually put my first two down so
that<00:03:43.170> they<00:03:43.290> make<00:03:43.440> an<00:03:43.590> X<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.880> then

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
that they make an X like that and then

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.630 
that they make an X like that and then
my<00:03:49.080> third<00:03:49.440> one<00:03:51.860> kind<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.920> goes<00:03:53.100> around<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.490> X

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
my third one kind of goes around the X

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.030 
my third one kind of goes around the X
so<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:53.910> usually<00:03:54.120> use<00:03:54.330> two<00:03:55.170> or<00:03:55.320> three<00:03:55.590> pieces<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
so I usually use two or three pieces of

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.460 
so I usually use two or three pieces of
paper<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:57.270> make<00:03:57.300> it<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.810> I'm<00:03:57.960> just<00:03:58.020> gonna<00:03:58.170> kind

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
paper to make it and I'm just gonna kind

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.100 
paper to make it and I'm just gonna kind
of<00:03:58.530> look<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.910> how<00:04:00.150> how<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.870> kind<00:04:01.050> of

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
of look at it and see how how it kind of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.260 
of look at it and see how how it kind of
lines<00:04:01.350> up<00:04:01.590> nicely<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.370> then<00:04:03.030> I'm<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.240> to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
lines up nicely and then I'm going to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.790 
lines up nicely and then I'm going to
take<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.540> waterway<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.200> gonna<00:04:04.380> drop<00:04:04.620> it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
take this waterway and I'm gonna drop it

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.440 
take this waterway and I'm gonna drop it
right<00:04:04.830> in<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.220> middle<00:04:05.460> now<00:04:05.850> if<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.090> notice

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
right in the middle now if you notice

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.760 
right in the middle now if you notice
this<00:04:06.840> water<00:04:07.110> weight<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.440> kind<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
this water weight it's kind of a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.000 
this water weight it's kind of a
roly-poly<00:04:08.100> thing<00:04:08.730> now<00:04:09.630> this<00:04:10.350> can<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.740> neat

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
roly-poly thing now this can be a neat

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.710 
roly-poly thing now this can be a neat
effect<00:04:11.160> if<00:04:11.550> you<00:04:11.580> want<00:04:11.940> your<00:04:12.090> balloons<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.600> have

effect if you want your balloons to have

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360 
effect if you want your balloons to have
a<00:04:12.750> little<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.260> roly-poly<00:04:13.740> movement<00:04:14.310> to

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
a little bit of roly-poly movement to

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.310 
a little bit of roly-poly movement to
them<00:04:14.520> but<00:04:15.030> most<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.570> time<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> probably

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
them but most of the time you probably

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.920 
them but most of the time you probably
don't<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.160> how<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.520> stabilize<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
way that you stabilize it is with

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.670
