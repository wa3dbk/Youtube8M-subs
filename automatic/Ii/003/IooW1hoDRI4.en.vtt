00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.019
 by 100 until today 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.529
 on the contrary 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.130
 Here we have the closest 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.749
 guided by the lady hours 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.710
 it is very simple 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.100
 very light 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.070
 You can transport your own fuel within the same is very important 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.820
 it works with all types of alcohol, that is, currently the sanitary framework 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.050
 any type of alcohol

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 we open the lid 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.780

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.130

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.530
 and inside 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.690
 we have them on the rubber gasket 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.350
