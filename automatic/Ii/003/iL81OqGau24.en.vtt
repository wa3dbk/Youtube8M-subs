00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
where the robot is now the me and a you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
where the robot is now the me and a you
Chronos<00:01:51.090> believe<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.899> robot<00:01:52.320> was

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
Chronos believe that the robot was

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
Chronos believe that the robot was
actually<00:01:53.130> hidden<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:53.970> moon<00:01:54.509> before<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
actually hidden on the moon before it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
actually hidden on the moon before it
ever<00:01:55.680> got<00:01:56.219> t<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:57.149> origins<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.840> let<00:01:58.049> us

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
ever got t or two origins now let us

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520 
ever got t or two origins now let us
explain<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.280> basically<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.600> believe<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
explain so basically we believe that the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.389 
explain so basically we believe that the
zombies<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.369> moon<00:02:02.759> were<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.869> for

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
zombies on moon were actually there for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.850 
zombies on moon were actually there for
purpose<00:02:05.399> not<00:02:05.759> only<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.630> griffin<00:02:07.200> station

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
purpose not only just griffin station

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
purpose not only just griffin station
but<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> actually<00:02:08.670> build<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:10.080> massive<00:02:10.730> robot

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
but to actually build this massive robot

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400 
but to actually build this massive robot
now<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.330> probably<00:02:12.540> run<00:02:13.020> during

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
now you're probably run during

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.560 
now you're probably run during
where<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.280> heck<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:14.880> they<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.180> kept

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
where in the heck could they have kept

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.230 
where in the heck could they have kept
it<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.530> answered<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.210> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
it and I have answered this there is a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.900 
it and I have answered this there is a
massive<00:02:18.750> chasm<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.980> when<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> play<00:02:20.580> moon

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
massive chasm and when you play moon

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.670 
massive chasm and when you play moon
I'll<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.540> some<00:02:21.750> gameplay<00:02:22.230> right<00:02:22.470> now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I'll put up some gameplay right now

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.470 
I'll put up some gameplay right now
there's<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.160> massive<00:02:23.490> chasm<00:02:23.940> where<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
there's a massive chasm where the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
there's a massive chasm where the
Rockets<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:25.200> stored<00:02:25.500> right<00:02:25.740> before<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.340> are

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
Rockets are stored right before they are

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.900 
Rockets are stored right before they are
supposed<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.180> let<00:02:27.630> out<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:29.070> there's<00:02:29.550> got

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
supposed to be let out and I there's got

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.680 
supposed to be let out and I there's got
to<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.180> some<00:02:30.750> sort<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.230> massive<00:02:31.500> room<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
to be some sort of massive room for a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
to be some sort of massive room for a
1000<00:02:33.690> foot<00:02:33.900> tall<00:02:34.170> robot<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.070> definitely

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
1000 foot tall robot and I definitely

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.630 
1000 foot tall robot and I definitely
think<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.990> robot<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.710> hidden<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
think that the robot was hidden there it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.900 
think that the robot was hidden there it
was<00:02:39.060> created<00:02:39.420> there<00:02:40.020> by<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.470> workers<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
was created there by the workers on the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.710 
was created there by the workers on the
moon<00:02:42.390> unfortunately<00:02:43.380> those<00:02:43.590> workers<00:02:44.720> became

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
moon unfortunately those workers became

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120 
moon unfortunately those workers became
into<00:02:46.050> zombies<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.970> sort<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.600> AI<00:02:49.170> zombie

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
into zombies but the sort of AI zombie

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.240 
into zombies but the sort of AI zombie
robot<00:02:50.550> was<00:02:51.060> sort<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.510> left<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.680> max<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
robot was sort of left there now max is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.760 
robot was sort of left there now max is
told<00:02:53.520> her<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.880> activate<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.900> robot<00:02:55.110> by<00:02:55.560> using

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
told her to activate the robot by using

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.980 
told her to activate the robot by using
the<00:02:55.980> computers<00:02:56.550> which<00:02:56.820> were<00:02:57.000> used<00:02:57.210> for<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
the computers which were used for the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.650 
the computers which were used for the
Samantha<00:02:58.620> says<00:02:58.860> easter<00:02:59.370> egg<00:02:59.550> step<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.390> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
Samantha says easter egg step now that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.720 
Samantha says easter egg step now that
could<00:03:00.840> be<00:03:00.900> either<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.440> Samantha<00:03:02.160> says<00:03:02.400> easter

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
could be either the Samantha says easter

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330 
could be either the Samantha says easter
egg<00:03:02.850> step<00:03:03.150> or<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.900> computer<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
egg step or that one computer in the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.000 
egg step or that one computer in the
starting<00:03:06.240> room<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.630> moon<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.440> totally

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
starting room of moon it's not totally

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.970 
starting room of moon it's not totally
sure<00:03:08.040> which<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.850> now<00:03:09.630> we<00:03:10.440> believe<00:03:10.800> also

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
sure which one it is now we believe also

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.640 
sure which one it is now we believe also
that<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.400> robot<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:12.060> be<00:03:12.300> an<00:03:12.450> AI<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.500> also

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that the robot can be an AI but can also

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.650 
that the robot can be an AI but can also
be<00:03:13.860> controlled<00:03:14.160> by<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.490> person<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.360> sort<00:03:15.630> of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
be controlled by a person that sort of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.870 
be controlled by a person that sort of
goes<00:03:15.810> back<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.350> me<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.680> Iowa<00:03:17.100> gaming's<00:03:17.580> theory

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
goes back to me and Iowa gaming's theory

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.630 
goes back to me and Iowa gaming's theory
about<00:03:18.120> Oregon<00:03:18.930> maybe<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:20.010> has<00:03:20.160> something<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
about Oregon maybe this has something to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.190 
about Oregon maybe this has something to
do<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.209> we're<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> hundred<00:03:22.050> percent

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
do with it we're not a hundred percent

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.190 
do with it we're not a hundred percent
sure<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.490> basically<00:03:24.090> what<00:03:24.240> Samantha<00:03:24.750> did<00:03:24.900> she

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
sure so basically what Samantha did she

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.530 
sure so basically what Samantha did she
activated<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.980> robot<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.520> she<00:03:26.820> summons<00:03:27.330> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
activated the robot and she summons it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.570 
activated the robot and she summons it
to<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.810> surface<00:03:28.050> maxxis<00:03:28.980> tells<00:03:29.220> her<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
to the surface maxxis tells her the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.940 
to the surface maxxis tells her the
coordinates<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.390> reit<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.959> redirect<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
coordinates to the reit to redirect a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.640 
coordinates to the reit to redirect a
teleporter<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:32.970> rerouted<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.959> travel<00:03:34.470> back

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
teleporter and rerouted to travel back

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.890 
teleporter and rerouted to travel back
in<00:03:34.920> time<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.760> nineteen<00:03:36.150> eighteen<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
in time to nineteen eighteen now the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.860 
in time to nineteen eighteen now the
purpose<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.090> we<00:03:39.090> are<00:03:39.240> actually<00:03:39.480> not

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
purpose of this we are actually not

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
purpose of this we are actually not
totally<00:03:40.110> shared<00:03:40.620> definitely<00:03:41.340> when<00:03:41.490> origins

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
totally shared definitely when origins

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.040 
totally shared definitely when origins
comes<00:03:42.270> out<00:03:42.480> we<00:03:42.690> will<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.110> full<00:03:43.620> proof<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.250> why

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
comes out we will have full proof of why

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.840 
comes out we will have full proof of why
Samantha<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:46.230> Maxis<00:03:46.920> did<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.550> and

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
Samantha and Maxis did this and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.150 
Samantha and Maxis did this and
basically<00:03:48.540> samantha<00:03:49.320> gets<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.770> robot

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
basically samantha gets in the robot

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.070 
basically samantha gets in the robot
takes<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.820> teleporter<00:03:51.510> teleports<00:03:51.660> to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
takes it to the teleporter teleports to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.190 
takes it to the teleporter teleports to
France<00:03:52.470> 1918<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.850> robot<00:03:54.300> was<00:03:54.510> designed<00:03:54.660> by

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
France 1918 the robot was designed by

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.170 
France 1918 the robot was designed by
the<00:03:55.380> workers<00:03:55.800> at<00:03:56.220> Griffin<00:03:56.550> station<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:57.030> I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the workers at Griffin station like I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.380 
the workers at Griffin station like I
said<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.989> robot<00:03:58.560> goes<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.520> origins<00:04:00.180> and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
said and the robot goes to origins and

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.900 
said and the robot goes to origins and
that<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.959> where<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.800> now<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.670> our

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that is where it is now that is our

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.300 
that is where it is now that is our
theory<00:04:03.450> personally<00:04:04.050> I<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.290> think<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
theory personally I do think that the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.870 
theory personally I do think that the
robot<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.300> created<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.260> moon<00:04:07.590> definitely<00:04:08.550> not

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
robot was created in moon definitely not

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.350 
robot was created in moon definitely not
created<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:10.010> origins<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.250> think<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.330> a

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
created on origins I think this is a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.630 
created on origins I think this is a
very<00:04:12.540> very<00:04:13.200> good<00:04:13.470> theory<00:04:13.770> all<00:04:14.010> credit<00:04:14.459> goes<00:04:14.489> to

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
very very good theory all credit goes to

great thing but before and this video

great thing but before and this video
actually<00:04:26.700> wanted

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
actually wanted

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.749 
actually wanted
notice<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.840> other<00:04:28.229> things<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.889> treyarch

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
notice to other things that treyarch

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.450 
notice to other things that treyarch
ordinance<00:04:30.599> and<00:04:30.780> put<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.039> origin

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
ordinance and put in the origin

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.279 
ordinance and put in the origin
cinematic<00:04:33.030> trailer<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.479> first<00:04:33.720> thing<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.080> on

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
cinematic trailer the first thing is on

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.260 
cinematic trailer the first thing is on
the<00:04:34.380> top<00:04:34.620> left<00:04:34.889> corner<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.550> moon<00:04:35.789> loading

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
the top left corner of the moon loading

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.839 
the top left corner of the moon loading
screen<00:04:36.599> you<00:04:37.050> can<00:04:37.169> see<00:04:37.440> something<00:04:37.889> named<00:04:38.190> ugly

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
screen you can see something named ugly

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.480 
screen you can see something named ugly
sounds<00:04:39.419> now<00:04:39.569> says<00:04:39.840> 95<00:04:40.259> cents<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.039> there<00:04:41.069> is

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
sounds now says 95 cents and there is

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.999 
sounds now says 95 cents and there is
actually<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.000> robot<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.930> there<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.620> maybe

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
actually a robot in there so maybe

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.610 
actually a robot in there so maybe
Samantha<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.630> big<00:04:45.840> thing<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.440> is

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
Samantha this is the big thing this is

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.100 
Samantha this is the big thing this is
exactly<00:04:47.009> why<00:04:47.310> we<00:04:47.340> think<00:04:47.639> samantha<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.419> in<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
exactly why we think samantha is in the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.860 
exactly why we think samantha is in the
robot<00:04:49.590> samantha<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:50.970> richtofen's<00:04:51.599> body

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
robot samantha is in richtofen's body

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.320 
robot samantha is in richtofen's body
which<00:04:52.199> does<00:04:52.470> make<00:04:52.500> her<00:04:53.099> give<00:04:53.400> out<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.639> very

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
which does make her give out that very

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.650 
which does make her give out that very
gross<00:04:55.020> sort<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.560> sounding<00:04:56.039> voice<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.789> we<00:04:57.419> do

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
gross sort of sounding voice and we do

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.689 
gross sort of sounding voice and we do
believe<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.199> she's<00:04:58.470> sort<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.919> shemale<00:04:59.430> so

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
believe that she's sort of a shemale so

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.450 
believe that she's sort of a shemale so
that's<00:04:59.909> why<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.449> think<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:01.139> says<00:05:01.409> ugly<00:05:01.949> sounds

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
that's why I think it says ugly sounds

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.980 
that's why I think it says ugly sounds
and<00:05:02.610> there's<00:05:02.759> a<00:05:02.819> robot<00:05:03.270> there<00:05:03.539> so<00:05:03.780> that's

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
and there's a robot there so that's

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.559 
and there's a robot there so that's
personally<00:05:04.560> my<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.759> Chronos<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.180> theory

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
personally my and you Chronos is theory

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.920 
personally my and you Chronos is theory
and<00:05:07.319> also<00:05:07.860> i'm<00:05:08.159> back<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.060> Maxis<00:05:09.750> is

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
and also i'm back to the Maxis is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.260 
and also i'm back to the Maxis is
periodic<00:05:10.590> arrangement<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.280> elements<00:05:11.520> if<00:05:12.060> you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
periodic arrangement of elements if you

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.210 
periodic arrangement of elements if you
guys<00:05:12.509> were<00:05:12.720> around<00:05:12.840> for<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:13.500> entree<00:05:14.159> or

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
guys were around for that entree or

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.149 
guys were around for that entree or
Facebook<00:05:14.819> or<00:05:15.000> Twitter<00:05:15.319> the<00:05:16.319> I<00:05:16.349> actually<00:05:16.740> said

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
Facebook or Twitter the I actually said

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.100 
Facebook or Twitter the I actually said
that<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.490> would<00:05:17.580> be<00:05:17.729> releasing<00:05:17.970> weapons<00:05:18.810> of

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
that they would be releasing weapons of

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.050 
that they would be releasing weapons of
different<00:05:19.740> elements<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.430> if<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.669> look<00:05:20.880> at

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
different elements and if you look at

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.240 
different elements and if you look at
the<00:05:21.090> moon<00:05:21.300> loading<00:05:21.659> screen<00:05:21.930> above<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.830> idol

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
the moon loading screen above the idol

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.480 
the moon loading screen above the idol
Idol<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.909> think<00:05:24.210> two<00:05:24.539> or<00:05:24.900> three<00:05:25.440> boxes<00:05:25.800> above<00:05:26.190> it

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
Idol I think two or three boxes above it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.159 
Idol I think two or three boxes above it
you<00:05:26.520> can<00:05:26.819> actually<00:05:27.060> see<00:05:27.300> something<00:05:27.810> called

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
you can actually see something called

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.980 
you can actually see something called
the<00:05:28.380> xenon<00:05:28.889> belt<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.460> xenon<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.240> an<00:05:30.599> element

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
the xenon belt and xenon is an element

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.560 
the xenon belt and xenon is an element
so<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.680> basically<00:05:32.250> proves<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.449> was

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
so that basically proves that I was

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.659 
so that basically proves that I was
actually<00:05:33.930> kind<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.620> right<00:05:34.949> about<00:05:35.370> what

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
actually kind of right about what

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.330 
actually kind of right about what

they're doing so guys that's basically

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.459 
they're doing so guys that's basically
