00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.920 
know what star is for those of you make
international<00:02:31.820> calls<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.420> know<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:32.660> plus

international calls you know what plus

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.410 
international calls you know what plus
is<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.130> lot<00:02:34.460> of<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:34.640> probably<00:02:34.880> don't<00:02:35.330> know

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
is but a lot of you probably don't know

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.600 
is but a lot of you probably don't know
that<00:02:35.780> when<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.930> hit<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.620> button<00:02:36.890> it's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
that when you hit this button it's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.300 
that when you hit this button it's
actually<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.180> shift<00:02:38.570> key<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.560> yes<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.040> have

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
actually a shift key so yes you have

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.610 
actually a shift key so yes you have
access<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.670> those<00:02:40.940> keys<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.020> also<00:02:42.260> have

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
access to those keys but you also have

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.900 
access to those keys but you also have
access<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.190> these<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.700> pause<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.040> wait<00:02:46.040> here's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
access to these to pause and wait here's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420 
access to these to pause and wait here's
the<00:02:46.970> difference<00:02:47.270> between<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.020> two<00:02:48.430> every

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the difference between the two every

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.790 
the difference between the two every
time<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.880> hit<00:02:50.090> pause<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.200> phone<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> going<00:02:51.739> to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
time you hit pause the phone is going to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.220 
time you hit pause the phone is going to
wait<00:02:52.040> two<00:02:52.459> seconds<00:02:52.970> before<00:02:53.180> doing<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.840> next

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
wait two seconds before doing the next

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.100 
wait two seconds before doing the next
action<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.640> let's<00:02:56.330> say<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.900> call<00:02:57.050> a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
action so let's say I have to call a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.979 
action so let's say I have to call a
business<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.980> know<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.520> if<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.940> try<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.810> hit

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
business and I know that if I try to hit

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.990 
business and I know that if I try to hit
zero<00:03:00.290> right<00:03:00.620> away<00:03:00.890> it's<00:03:01.459> not<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.850> do

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
zero right away it's not going to do

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
zero right away it's not going to do
anything<00:03:02.209> but<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:02.989> my<00:03:03.140> phone<00:03:03.350> wait<00:03:03.620> six

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
anything but if my phone wait six

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.880 
anything but if my phone wait six
seconds<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:05.060> will<00:03:05.390> then<00:03:05.660> hit<00:03:05.930> zero<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.560> I'll

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
seconds it will then hit zero and I'll

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.070 
seconds it will then hit zero and I'll
get<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> operator<00:03:07.610> here's<00:03:08.510> how<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.720> do<00:03:08.959> it

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
get the operator here's how you do it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.050 
get the operator here's how you do it
you<00:03:09.230> would<00:03:09.650> dial<00:03:09.890> your<00:03:10.070> normal<00:03:10.520> phone<00:03:10.700> number

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
you would dial your normal phone number

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.080 
you would dial your normal phone number
hit<00:03:11.840> pause<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:13.520> have<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.730> hit<00:03:13.940> this

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
hit pause you then have to hit this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.170 
hit pause you then have to hit this
little<00:03:14.300> shift<00:03:14.600> key<00:03:14.780> again<00:03:15.170> pause<00:03:15.910> pause<00:03:16.910> again

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
little shift key again pause pause again

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.170 
little shift key again pause pause again
and<00:03:17.660> then<00:03:18.080> zero<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.910> phone<00:03:20.090> is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
and then zero so now what the phone is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.250 
and then zero so now what the phone is
going<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.360> do<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.630> when<00:03:20.750> i<00:03:20.780> call<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:21.200> number

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
going to do is when i call this number

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.100 
going to do is when i call this number
it's<00:03:21.769> going<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.980> call<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.400> main<00:03:22.700> phone<00:03:22.940> number

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
it's going to call the main phone number

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.840 
it's going to call the main phone number
wait<00:03:24.110> six<00:03:24.410> seconds<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.100> then<00:03:25.519> it's<00:03:25.670> going<00:03:25.760> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
wait six seconds and then it's going to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.720 
wait six seconds and then it's going to
automatically<00:03:26.450> dial<00:03:26.840> zero<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:28.400> there's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
automatically dial zero now there's

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.699 
automatically dial zero now there's
another<00:03:28.850> alternative<00:03:29.180> which<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.320> lot<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.560> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
another alternative which a lot of you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.970 
another alternative which a lot of you
are<00:03:30.769> going<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.950> probably<00:03:31.160> want<00:03:31.910> instead<00:03:32.540> in

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
are going to probably want instead in

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.340 
are going to probably want instead in
the<00:03:33.980> case<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.220> Apple<00:03:34.790> as<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.209> said<00:03:35.450> sometimes<00:03:36.200> it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the case of Apple as I said sometimes it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.080 
the case of Apple as I said sometimes it
will<00:03:36.530> say<00:03:36.920> what<00:03:37.190> product<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.610> calling<00:03:38.000> about

will say what product you calling about

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.479 
will say what product you calling about
however<00:03:39.080> if<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.620> recently<00:03:39.830> called<00:03:40.340> them

here's<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> trick<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.860> use<00:03:49.150> when<00:03:50.150> you're

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
here's the trick that I use when you're

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.800

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.860 
calling apple you do the 1-800 275 2273
then<00:03:54.769> wait<00:03:55.810> 0<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.549> pound<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.600> what<00:03:59.780> will

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
then wait 0 and pound so what will

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.750 
then wait 0 and pound so what will
happen<00:03:59.900> is<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.410> when<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.769> hits<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.250> menu
