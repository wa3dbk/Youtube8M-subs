today we're we going over this whole
ranked<00:00:12.150> play<00:00:12.330> Division<00:00:12.660> system<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> guys

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
ranked play Division system so you guys

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.620 
ranked play Division system so you guys
can<00:00:13.740> understand<00:00:14.160> how<00:00:14.280> exactly<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.330> into

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
can understand how exactly you get into

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.930 
can understand how exactly you get into
higher<00:00:15.870> divisions<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> maybe<00:00:17.310> even<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.789> that

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
higher divisions and maybe even get that

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
higher divisions and maybe even get that
sought<00:00:18.210> after<00:00:18.390> master<00:00:18.930> division<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:19.920> let's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
sought after master division first let's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.380 
sought after master division first let's
take<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> look<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> divisions<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
take a look at all the divisions that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
take a look at all the divisions that
there<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.320> ranked<00:00:22.619> play<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
there are here in ranked play so the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.009 
there are here in ranked play so the
first<00:00:23.789> division<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.180> will<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.840> you've

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
first division you will be in if you've

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
first division you will be in if you've
never<00:00:25.260> play<00:00:25.529> ranked<00:00:25.800> play<00:00:25.980> before<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.580> if

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
never play ranked play before or if

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
never play ranked play before or if
you're<00:00:26.849> new<00:00:26.939> season<00:00:27.359> starts<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.930> bronze<00:00:28.529> then

of these divisions have its own armor

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
of these divisions have its own armor
set<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> place<00:00:47.160> inside

set that you can get if you place inside

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
set that you can get if you place inside
this<00:00:47.730> division<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> end<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> season<00:00:49.079> now

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this division at the end of a season now

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
this division at the end of a season now
what<00:00:50.100> exactly<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> season<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.140> not

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
what exactly is a season well I'm not

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
what exactly is a season well I'm not
really<00:00:52.440> sure<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:52.949> often<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.670> seasons

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
really sure how often these seasons

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.790 
really sure how often these seasons
happen<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> season<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> month-long

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
happen but a season is a month-long

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
happen but a season is a month-long
event<00:00:56.100> where<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> resets<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.270> division<00:00:57.719> back

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
event where it resets your division back

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
event where it resets your division back
down<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> bronze<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.160> everyone<00:00:59.609> tries

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
down to bronze and then everyone tries

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
down to bronze and then everyone tries
as<00:01:00.149> hard<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> entire<00:01:01.829> month

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
as hard as they can for the entire month

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
as hard as they can for the entire month
to<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> highest<00:01:02.940> division<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.510> can

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to get in the highest division they can

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.969 
to get in the highest division they can
and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> end<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> month

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and then at the end of the month

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.649 
and then at the end of the month
whatever<00:01:05.309> division<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> end<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.510> get

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
whatever division you end up in you get

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
whatever division you end up in you get
the<00:01:06.780> rewards<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the rewards for all right so now you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030 
the rewards for all right so now you
understand<00:01:09.360> seasons<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> divisions<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.920> now

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
understand seasons and divisions and now

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800 
understand seasons and divisions and now
let's<00:01:11.220> talk<00:01:11.369> about<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> whole<00:01:11.909> point<00:01:12.210> system

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
let's talk about the whole point system

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
let's talk about the whole point system
this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> where<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> people<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
this is where a lot of people get a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is where a lot of people get a
little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.700> confused<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.810> each<00:01:15.990> division<00:01:16.229> has

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
little bit confused so each division has

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.710 
little bit confused so each division has
100<00:01:17.400> points<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.479> need<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
100 points to it that you will need to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690 
100 points to it that you will need to
get<00:01:19.049> points<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.710> either<00:01:19.860> gained<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.670> lost

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
get points are either gained or lost

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
get points are either gained or lost
each<00:01:21.240> game<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> play<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> ranked<00:01:22.920> you'll

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
each game that you play in ranked you'll

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.719 
each game that you play in ranked you'll
gain<00:01:23.490> 15<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.450> 25<00:01:24.900> points<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> win<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
gain 15 to 25 points for a win and you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
gain 15 to 25 points for a win and you
will<00:01:26.850> lose<00:01:27.030> 10<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> 20<00:01:27.840> points<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.409> loss

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
will lose 10 to 20 points for your loss

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
will lose 10 to 20 points for your loss
how<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> gain<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.000> lose<00:01:30.180> depends<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
how much you gain or lose depends on if

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
how much you gain or lose depends on if
the<00:01:30.960> game<00:01:31.140> thought<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> fair<00:01:31.950> match<00:01:32.189> or

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the game thought it was a fair match or

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
the game thought it was a fair match or
not<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:32.850> somebody<00:01:33.509> leaves<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.259> so
