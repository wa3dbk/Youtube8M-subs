to<00:05:14.940> go<00:05:15.060> down<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.270> pic<00:05:15.510> Joe<00:05:15.810> up<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:16.740> don't<00:05:16.980> know

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
to go down a pic Joe up and I don't know

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.560 
to go down a pic Joe up and I don't know
what<00:05:17.670> sort<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:17.940> work<00:05:18.150> we're<00:05:18.300> going<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:18.480> do

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
what sort of work we're going to do

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.060 
what sort of work we're going to do
because<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.110> work<00:05:19.260> we<00:05:19.410> got<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.680> actually

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
because the work we got is actually

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.190 
because the work we got is actually
outside<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.090> think<00:05:21.690> that's<00:05:21.930> going<00:05:22.140> to

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
outside so I think that's going to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.390 
outside so I think that's going to
happen<00:05:22.290> at<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.620> moment<00:05:22.950> until<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.340> snow

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
happen at the moment until the snow

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.940 
happen at the moment until the snow
melts<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.940> bit<00:05:24.090> more<00:05:24.240> if<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.690> does<00:05:24.870> but<00:05:25.290> it's

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
melts a bit more if it does but it's

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.320 
melts a bit more if it does but it's
cool<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.520> its<00:05:26.820> calling<00:05:27.150> for<00:05:27.270> snow<00:05:27.390> loving<00:05:27.900> it

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
cool in its calling for snow loving it

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.940 
cool in its calling for snow loving it
yeah<00:05:30.330> it's<00:05:30.630> cool<00:05:30.810> if<00:05:30.960> it's<00:05:31.110> snow<00:05:31.380> over<00:05:31.860> the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
yeah it's cool if it's snow over the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.100 
yeah it's cool if it's snow over the
