00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
product or a tutorial on my blog and I'd

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.660 
product or a tutorial on my blog and I'd
like<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.869> um<00:01:49.640> when<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like to do more of that but um when I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.280 
like to do more of that but um when I
found<00:01:51.000> these<00:01:51.149> YouTube<00:01:51.689> channels<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> kind<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
found these YouTube channels I kind of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
found these YouTube channels I kind of
feel<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.649> would<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.100> more

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
feel like that would just be a more

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.100 
feel like that would just be a more
natural<00:01:54.090> place<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.049> stuff

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
natural place to do this kind of stuff

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.179 
natural place to do this kind of stuff
and<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.399> figured<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.710> start<00:01:58.710> doing<00:01:59.009> one

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and so I figured I could start doing one

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.110 
and so I figured I could start doing one
on<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.610> own<00:01:59.640> beauty

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
on my own beauty

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
on my own beauty

them<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.440> figured<00:02:25.710> I've<00:02:26.040> got<00:02:26.250> stuff<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
them and I figured I've got stuff to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
them and I figured I've got stuff to
share<00:02:26.790> people<00:02:27.510> ask<00:02:27.630> me<00:02:27.690> questions<00:02:28.080> all<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
share people ask me questions all the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.100 
share people ask me questions all the
time<00:02:28.470> about<00:02:28.800> certain<00:02:29.250> things<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.110> figured

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
time about certain things and so figured

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.000 
time about certain things and so figured
it<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> good<00:02:32.670> place<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
it just was a good place to do that and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.650 
it just was a good place to do that and
so<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.220> video<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.670> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> boring<00:02:36.270> sits

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so this video is kind of boring sits

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.330
