happens to be very difficult with these
round<00:00:08.730> balls<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.179> don't<00:00:09.360> get<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:09.690> much<00:00:09.840> but

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
round balls that don't get very much but

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.360 
round balls that don't get very much but
I'll<00:00:10.410> do<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> best<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.889> can

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this is just the very basic stops or

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.259 
this is just the very basic stops or

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
contact move you can mix into your

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.700 
contact move you can mix into your
juggling<00:00:15.540> like<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.109> did<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.590> just

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
juggling like I just did you can just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.120 
juggling like I just did you can just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
I've ever tried give it a go to explain

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.919 
I've ever tried give it a go to explain
in<00:00:30.090> order<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.750> should<00:00:30.900> first

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
in order to do this you should first

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
in order to do this you should first
stick<00:00:31.619> your<00:00:31.769> arm<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.070> stars<00:00:32.399> will<00:00:32.550> go

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
stick your arm out and stars will go

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450 
stick your arm out and stars will go
straight<00:00:33.570> walk<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.290> elbow<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> figure<00:00:35.370> out

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
straight walk your elbow and figure out

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
straight walk your elbow and figure out
where<00:00:35.730> you're<00:00:36.090> balancing<00:00:36.480> point<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.980> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
where you're balancing point is so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
where you're balancing point is so
everyone's<00:00:38.579> arm<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> different<00:00:39.239> mind<00:00:39.540> your

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
everyone's arm is different mind your

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.240 
everyone's arm is different mind your
end<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.739> further<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.129> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
end here or a little further on my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
end here or a little further on my
forearm<00:00:41.640> depending<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.149> how<00:00:42.570> soft<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
forearm depending on how soft and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
forearm depending on how soft and
squishy<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> ball<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> once<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> have

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
squishy the ball is so once you have

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
squishy the ball is so once you have
that<00:00:45.390> position<00:00:45.570> figured<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:47.160> going

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
