 the following exercise 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.099
 we slowly make the body box 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.889
 every exercise we perform 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.109
 goals of a primary school tent 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.839
 the boss wants to say honey 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.210
 feet lap width 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 lightly through the knees 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.929
 log in first 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.089
 we heard ski poles 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.160
 it is according to 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
 celebrate outstretched arms in the small gap 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.200

 quietly exercise with you along your wrists 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.990
 among others

 pinto tuktuk a little weights 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 on the keel is sufficient 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.740
 for example a ski helmet 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.340
 attach the pedro to color more dsm the sun marks the rotterdams allowed 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.520
 the municipal law 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.950
 the same position a ferrari base group relaunch a new book is below 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.350
 the closer to each other from there but then there was movement 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 make sure you don't spend too much percent 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 and slowly becoming parks of the club 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 Group members is easy 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.460
 to the prima 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.170

 eurlings of course 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.810
 calm exercise 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.710
 among other things we stood our as I on the shoulders asscher 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.950
 the connection 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.020
 we are now going to restore the muscles 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 both partners has stopped 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.950
 baking right 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.100
 displacement behind our back 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.040
 from this position, the committee will turn left 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.090
 we're actually going to pull a little 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.340
 amnesty stop so-called take 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 nec can 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.430
 a lot of tension comes on your right shoulder and upper arm, which is an Easter solid 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.220
 still fixed 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.259
 leave in the summer direction I miss a boat 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.630
 your pass will arrive in the city as needed 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.119
 That means that now bottom right s 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.499
 and left is above 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 down toxic substances from there 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.729
 instead of holding on to it you feel the tension 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.149
 at the top at the top with voters 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.079
 it's slowly going up 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.959
 that it feels the tension is sufficient 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 it is hold 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.399
 following exercise this has the basic posture 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.329
 catchy stops behind 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.429
 and then the second round 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:40.789
 stand firm 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.069
 we actually bring our as high as possible so that they don't go any further 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.459
 being able 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.919
 if there is a position that little bit held 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.409
 go slow as possible 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.229
 We actually try the school's slightest difference is that there is a limit 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.089
 something back 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.449
 want to make it a little harder for you to fight two more 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.299
 grabbed to stop drinking will notice that you could then continue 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.779
 super lie and care 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.779
 also fixed 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.079
 also fell last week 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.139
 you have two ski poles 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.749
 to be your boss 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.699
 feet shoulder width it is no longer sag 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.369
 keep a little straight 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.569
 and basically just a stick to pick this up as one 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.739
 cause malfunctions 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 the move slippertje from the right 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.259
 components the moment but now the most powerful 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.529
 is bent 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.779
 the other leg has risen 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:50.009
 staff of b 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.319
 and the Kempen 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.339
 you want to make it even more difficult yourself 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.289
 but then the second position 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:01.149
 very good by a list for think of that way back 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.149
 and goes fresh with your body weight 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.720
 to get even more tension on the thighs and buttock muscles 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.889
 if not yourself yet 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.589
 can go deeper 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 and that suggests that is 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.740
 also the last of the exercise points 5 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.990
 think we don't post 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.650
 well through the crisis field 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.080
 to serve 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.849
 we stop it being have to our anp 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.389
 well by dropping to 9 degrees it feels to the tension on the upper lip 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.529
 hold if this 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.699
 five seconds 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.080
 and relax again 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.490
 then also thirteen seconds 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.830
 for those who do it 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.249
 somewhat heavier 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.449
 against legs 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.830
 spread a little more 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.979
 veendam we can win 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.819
 and actually continue for hours 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.830
 minister has the cream 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.949
 if it's good how much tension now 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.529
 the thighs 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.039
 and on that buttock muscle 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039
 calm down 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.430
 except it definitely again 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.229
 now with more accent 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.339
 a little faster a little deeper on the intensity of exercises 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.339
 I do this checked 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.339
 lay a good foundation with this exercise 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.059
 daley blind spot starting 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.300
 ski trip power and agility 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.310
 Another good reaction from the home is the King Arthur 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.719
 good preparation is certainly not superfluous 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.669
 the preparation only depends on our condition 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.669
 were allowed to wear clothing and materials 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.020
 both determine successful and sporting 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.139
 if your location plays please check our website 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.339
 finally with now 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.539
 or just drop by one of our branches 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.739
 maybe a good band on behalf of top
