 him a very important element of information 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.029
 is colleagues at the meeting cleanliness 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.809
 exclusionary conflict 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.169
 between them and not put otherwise 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.539
 mixes get dirty most 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.270
 mixer in which today use 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.759
 DJ has a set of knobs top 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.420
 parts th 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 this question is flight 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.729
 top regulator usually labeled 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.219
 clinton control the population level it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.460
 same volume turning it i 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 I'm loud for six years we are interested in three 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 lower regulator which controls 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420
 low mid and high frequencies myself 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.910
 it all speaks for itself and Kiev 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.940
 surpasses the little known among them 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 shirvan 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.640
 and the high frequency control is marked 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.330
 high chistopolskaya this 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.020
 for example sound plate 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.000
 to the place of profit industry sewage 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.950
 different among the population for tobacco 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.300
 and other elements as a component 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.109
 study track obama 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.739
 bottom apple and bass on the fact that the court and the public 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.320
 Birkin bags must be taken 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 attempts at asia 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.799
 adjusting the frequency you control 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.790
 loud sound of certain instruments 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.250
 club website 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 you can temper loud synths 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.170
 if necessary, could make it quieter 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.040
 plates if they start to annoy 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.009
 I do not know Adam Booth Stability Pact 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.160
 he felt so bad 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.770
 but let's not talk for long let's 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 let's see how it works 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 this is top 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.440
 choose plates sound becomes bushin 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.330
 now you can turn on another trend baton 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.350
 will take the plates new track 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.609
 as recalled 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.110
 parliamentarian 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 ships mean less is needed 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.330
 synthesizer let's remove all his line 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.920
 except all these smells will be heard but it is already 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.970
 highest among such deals 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.700
 turned the feedback from 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.119
 corruption shop 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.659
 Now you can suppress the barrel apparently 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.659
 like this 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.279
 only cholesterol remained in the cabin 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.280
 at blow 20 were gone I turn 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.169
 regulator back area again on 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:17.889
 place 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.359
 but such control will not recur 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.979
 all frequencies allows you to do 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.979
 middle of a very smooth project segment 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.279
 accordingly let's consider 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.809
 as uses and city in the middle in 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:34.469
 this connection is remembered 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.050
 interfax right 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140
 and me folders and if the first full 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 melodies wide frequency range 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.239
 Ushakova 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.120
 we have one of our customers 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.409
 goblins 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.620
 Now I include this trend in which there is 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.409
 all charges bass synth drums 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.849
 and plates and gradually lazho 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.129
 the next 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.940
 twice 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.220
 to make it more smoothly I clean 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
 bastan iv 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.339
 do you hear how the dish entered 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.339
 now smoothly 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.720
 moskalkova however you can e place 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 better to do risk 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.759
 I changed his main projects from 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.759
 me back 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 view smoothly 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.139
 a bit more 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.219
 now smoothly despise the synthesizer 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.749
 so now the dish so i change 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.859
 note level but also by regulator 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.819
 loudness worth valorization which 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.319
 perform the role of volume control 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.729
 at a certain frequency range for 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.239
 low-rise construction 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.199
 trade union 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.409
 such famous DJs like that is 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.079
 documents and lovers do it very much 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.569
 beautiful and grace so use 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.210
 equalizer join 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210
 police 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.020
 now I want to dwell on that 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.370
 how to succeed 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.520
 although there are two ways as a stronghold first 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.660
 find something where you play music 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.919
 like and want to play yourself 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.020
 on the eve of the visit on May 19 each warehouse 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.130
 talk to those involved 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.070
 presentation organizer 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.540
 offer them your drives offer and 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.279
 discs promoter goods 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.139
 so there is one way to place an advertisement in 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.039
 online and imagine your 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.979
 mixes start making yourself 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.019
 reputation earning your name 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:11.859
 May but the best way to earn 

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:14.129
 fame succeed do it all 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.759
 yourself and start with your own many 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.699
 successful people started that way 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.709
 let's announce more communicate 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:22.639
 invite a couple of hundred friends and 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.939
 familiar to your performances and if you 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.329
 will arrange them once a month and you become 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:29.129
 would talk you would use 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.549
 fame you will be in demand because 

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:33.969
 that you attract a couple of hundred people to the club 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.189
 this is exactly the way out 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.539
 scene creation transforming yourself 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.539
 success scene 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.879
 another very important topic that I want 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.669
 touch processed warm-up public this 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.689
 that's where you probably had a lot 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.459
 to do when you started your career 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:53.460
 DJ 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.300
 it is the hardest work since 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.569
 requires a lot of stress so 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:58.919
 Cathedrals our project 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.089
 for money 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.549
 input some tips to help you 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:05.639
 succeed when warming up the public 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.069
 lyrics wii play that kind of music 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:09.729
 you yourself are happy 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.289
 would listen would have to repeat but she 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.899
 should not be too fast and not 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.099
 too loud and too aggressive 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.339
 choose soft melodic ballads 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.319
 very fast music spn helped over a hundred 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.689
 twenty four minutes does not fit 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.889
 to warm up the audience at the club victory 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.069
 today your task is to 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:29.900
 create an atmosphere of anticipation 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.509
 notes people should have 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.189
 waiting for something exciting what should 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.249
 it would not happen here in the fall 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.110
 so important it is to work all the more 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.770
 that all glory goes to someone 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.349
 to another basangov but if you will be fine 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.819
 cope with it you deserve great 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.849
 respect for since people understand 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.289
 how difficult is the task and so what 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.830
 try to do this job well when i 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.099
 wished success
