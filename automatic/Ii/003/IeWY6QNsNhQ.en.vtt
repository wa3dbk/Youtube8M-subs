most people's ears clean themselves

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.620 
most people's ears clean themselves
naturally<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:14.009> couple<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.759> processes<00:00:14.969> help

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
naturally a couple of processes help

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.410 
naturally a couple of processes help
this<00:00:15.809> alone<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.520> skin<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.180> the

auditory<00:00:20.430> canal<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:21.240> trying<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> remember

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
auditory canal right trying to remember

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.120 
auditory canal right trying to remember
which<00:00:22.380> part<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> ear<00:00:22.800> we're<00:00:22.920> talking

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
which part of the ear we're talking

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
which part of the ear we're talking
about<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.880> skin<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> external<00:00:24.869> auditory

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
about the skin of the external auditory

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.130 
about the skin of the external auditory
canal<00:00:25.350> grows<00:00:26.130> outward<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> conveyor<00:00:27.779> belt

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
canal grows outward like a conveyor belt

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
canal grows outward like a conveyor belt
so<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.650> wax<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> collects<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.970> skin

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so the wax that collects on that skin

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.440 
so the wax that collects on that skin
leaves<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> ear<00:00:31.439> naturally<00:00:32.040> also<00:00:32.700> those

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
leaves the ear naturally also those

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.850 
leaves the ear naturally also those

hairs<00:00:35.280> called<00:00:35.880> cilia<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.930> help<00:00:37.200> sort<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hairs called cilia that help sort of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.880 
hairs called cilia that help sort of
push<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> wax<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.750> most<00:00:40.020> cases<00:00:40.260> if

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
push the wax out so in most cases if

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
push the wax out so in most cases if
you're<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.190> messing<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> ear<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you're not messing with the ear in the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.010 
you're not messing with the ear in the
first<00:00:42.540> place

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
first place

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.529

wax<00:00:43.469> tends<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> come<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.610> its<00:00:44.640> own<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
wax tends to come out on its own the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
wax tends to come out on its own the
best<00:00:45.750> ways<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.440> wax<00:00:46.710> impacted<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> ear

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
best ways to get wax impacted in the ear

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.529 
best ways to get wax impacted in the ear
are<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.280> using<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.090> q-tip

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
are to try and get it out using a q-tip

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
are to try and get it out using a q-tip
usually<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.680> jams<00:00:53.399> wax<00:00:53.730> farther<00:00:54.120> down

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
usually that just jams wax farther down

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
usually that just jams wax farther down
in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> air<00:00:54.809> other<00:00:55.289> people<00:00:55.829> who<00:00:56.070> work<00:00:56.280> in

in the air other people who work in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
in the air other people who work in
noisy<00:00:56.820> environments<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> wear<00:00:57.899> ear

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

noisy environments and have to wear ear
plugs<00:00:58.350> frequently<00:00:59.129> may<00:00:59.699> also<00:00:59.879> find<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
plugs frequently may also find that the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
plugs frequently may also find that the
ears<00:01:00.899> fill<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.469> wax<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.430> happens<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
ears fill up with wax what happens if

make it easier for it to come out you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
make it easier for it to come out you
can<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> solution<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> warm<00:01:18.090> water
