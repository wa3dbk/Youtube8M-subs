you can get more another wort is to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.870 
you can get more another wort is to
plant<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.230> let's<00:02:19.230> say<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.950> was<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.460> blank

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
plant it and let's say this was a blank

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.300 
plant it and let's say this was a blank
area<00:02:23.360> there<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> brand<00:02:26.220> new

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
area there we go so this is a brand new

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.250 
area there we go so this is a brand new
area<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:26.880> planted<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.600> would<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.020> click

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
area I just planted I would just click

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
area I just planted I would just click
and<00:02:28.740> right<00:02:29.220> clicking<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:31.320> will

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and right clicking and that will

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.980 
and right clicking and that will
eventually<00:02:31.800> grow<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.850> stage<00:02:33.330> four<00:02:33.780> so

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
eventually grow up to stage four so

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.620 
eventually grow up to stage four so
that's<00:02:34.050> stage<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.670> that's<00:02:35.670> probably<00:02:36.240> stage

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
that's stage one that's probably stage

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's stage one that's probably stage
two<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.410> stage<00:02:37.800> three<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.490> four<00:02:39.980> not

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
two and that stage three or four not

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.500 
two and that stage three or four not
sure<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.220> they're<00:02:41.370> even<00:02:41.520> as<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> stage<00:02:42.150> four

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
sure if they're even as a stage four

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
sure if they're even as a stage four
because<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.320> don't<00:02:43.470> see<00:02:43.590> them<00:02:43.740> ever<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:44.070> any

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
because I don't see them ever get any

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.590 
because I don't see them ever get any
bigger<00:02:44.490> than<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.700> unless<00:02:45.390> there's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
bigger than that unless there's

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.110 
bigger than that unless there's
something<00:02:45.870> I'm<00:02:46.140> missing<00:02:46.350> anyway<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.400> once

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
something I'm missing anyway so once

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.250 
something I'm missing anyway so once
they<00:02:48.240> get<00:02:48.390> up<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.900> almost<00:02:49.020> see

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
they get up to it you can almost see

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.470 
they get up to it you can almost see
that<00:02:49.440> they're<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.190> shiny<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.880> they're

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that they're kind of shiny and they're

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.670 
that they're kind of shiny and they're
obviously<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> lot<00:02:52.020> taller<00:02:52.260> than<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> other

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
obviously a lot taller than the other

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160 
obviously a lot taller than the other
ones<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.160> click<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.690> get<00:02:54.870> at

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
ones you just click on it you get at

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.230 
ones you just click on it you get at
least<00:02:55.350> four<00:02:55.740> three<00:02:56.130> two<00:02:56.220> four<00:02:56.460> another<00:02:56.610> plant

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
least four three two four another plant

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.740 
least four three two four another plant
another<00:02:57.480> one

another one

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.500 
another one
just<00:02:58.500> keep<00:02:58.680> planting<00:02:59.160> never<00:02:59.370> harvest<00:03:00.330> and

then don't plant replant this Pike took

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.050 
then don't plant replant this Pike took
me<00:03:03.330> maybe<00:03:03.540> about<00:03:03.870> three<00:03:04.200> hours<00:03:05.000> maybe<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
little bit more to build I built it big

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.280 
little bit more to build I built it big
enough<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.970> by<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.330> time<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.720> harvest<00:03:10.140> all
