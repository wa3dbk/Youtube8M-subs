00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
in the fact that it's about to be

that<00:01:08.549> has<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> change<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.750> mathematics<00:01:10.290> or

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that has been a change in mathematics or

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
that has been a change in mathematics or
do<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.460> doing<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.909> his<00:01:12.060> way

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
do you think I was doing it in his way

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
do you think I was doing it in his way
there<00:01:12.479> oh<00:01:12.689> no<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.700> would<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.689> mean<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
there oh no I would I would I mean I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.719 
there oh no I would I would I mean I
would<00:01:17.070> bet<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:19.040> even<00:01:20.040> though<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.460> said

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
would bet that even though I just said

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
would bet that even though I just said
that<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> communal<00:01:22.020> experience<00:01:22.590> leads<00:01:22.890> us<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that the communal experience leads us to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
that the communal experience leads us to
this<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.759> would<00:01:23.939> bet<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.689> goes<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this I would bet that it goes all the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.100 
this I would bet that it goes all the
way<00:01:25.409> back<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:26.720> couldn't<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
way back actually couldn't go back to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.819 
way back actually couldn't go back to
the<00:01:28.829> fifth<00:01:29.610> century<00:01:29.700> BC<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.780> example<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> know

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the fifth century BC for example I know

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
the fifth century BC for example I know
you<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.280> you've<00:01:32.909> moved<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.540> bit

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you I know you've moved on a little bit

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
you I know you've moved on a little bit
from<00:01:33.780> high<00:01:33.900> school<00:01:34.170> mathematics<00:01:34.320> oh<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.280> don't

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
from high school mathematics oh I don't

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.830 
from high school mathematics oh I don't
know<00:01:36.020> no<00:01:37.020> cubic<00:01:37.560> cubic<00:01:38.040> equations<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.030> yeah

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
know no cubic cubic equations is yeah

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
know no cubic cubic equations is yeah
it's<00:01:40.380> still<00:01:40.680> something<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.610> understand

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it's still something we don't understand

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
it's still something we don't understand
this<00:01:42.689> emotion<00:01:43.350> being<00:01:43.590> expressed<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.220> kata

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
this emotion being expressed by kata

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
this emotion being expressed by kata
know<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.530> square<00:01:46.950> root<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.460> negative

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
know about the square root of negative

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.270 
know about the square root of negative
numbers<00:01:48.600> mhm<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.470> still<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.009> still<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
numbers mhm it's still it's still a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
numbers mhm it's still it's still a
thing<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> first<00:01:51.090> find<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.720> them

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
thing when you first find out about them

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
thing when you first find out about them
isn't<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> school<00:01:52.649> student<00:01:53.070> when<00:01:53.159> they

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
isn't it like a school student when they

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
isn't it like a school student when they
teach<00:01:53.549> yeah<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
teach yeah have you one like this is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.670 
teach yeah have you one like this is
still<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> human<00:01:56.219> experience<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.119> thrill<00:01:57.680> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
still a human experience a thrill you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.170 
still a human experience a thrill you
might<00:01:58.860> say<00:01:59.130> yeah<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:00.750> so
