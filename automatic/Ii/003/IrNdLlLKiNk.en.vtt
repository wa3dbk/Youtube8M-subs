00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.020
 that 's the music of moritz where I go 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.810
 in custom roms and we are at 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.130
 it reached jesse james and what the 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.210
 guys really make it absolute 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.970
 madness 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.320
 There is no kettle on it 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.769
 in the boiler we have a base here 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.789
 jumper 22 inch size and enisa basejump 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.089
 probably will probably be 14 14 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.619
 15 16 inch big tom kettle more or 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.129
 be less in it from neuss the bestie 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.020
 Outside is acrylic and the whole is 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.239
 has mounted down again on it 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.800
 a word from the pressure can out 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.180
 So there are also cases mounted on it 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.280
 is really an independent drum 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.769
 and also very cool what you at the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.960
 tom sees there is another event 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.519
 really is open at the side and in 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.960
 this band is again a valve more 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.089
 or less where the pressure from the blow 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.420
 then we go in we have hybrid kettles 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.609
 Acrylic and wood are also very nice 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.369
 cool and otherwise over there but 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.280
 still a set what a matte 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.390
 that could seem plastic 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.159
 be polycarbonate or again one 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.220
 what was inside was set up 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.810
 is illuminated with xlr stefan rahner like that 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.090
 probably with the mixed control 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.460
 still over here but one more 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.149
 couple of fancy kit variants of schels 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.079
 towed looks very very cool though 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.000
 So there are different materials 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.409
 we have something I always have 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.420
 leads because I do know a mirror 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.430
 feels transitions are very very cool 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.100
 Tibet is made of wood, I think very much 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.110
 cool and above 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.350
 this is really work at its best 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.600
 with mother of pearl inlays two different 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.579
 So wood species very very complex 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.329
 rehabilitated and here are even the tom 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.539
 bracket for the site legs with 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.430
 wood worked 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.439
 small tube salmon goes great with the design 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 has always done well here has so 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.890
 a bit of a chessboard 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.500
 or began with gamers has 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.439
 yes, these sloping fields 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.770
 normal continues to be really nice, but deeper 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.480
 from the small diameter base together 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.110
 so again with a mother of pearl 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.760
 inlay on the inside of the strip 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.640
 through salmon and behind him 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.900
 Master is that was the fire but also 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.480
 again worked with wood 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.340
 if we look further up one too 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 lit from inside and there is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.540
 really a black from here 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.310
 been set with holes on it 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.230
 looks very cool from the light something 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.650
 from inside through also shining again 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.660
 the trick jump drive over here very much 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 cool thing that and some still pushes 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.410
 times continue to look like that I also 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.440
 never seen there is actually one 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.650
 door installed here in the snare or what 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.320
 for a drum still that is in 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.300
 principle a fool of snow blower 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.350
 to come to the beach is the door 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 been installed 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.080
 so what the people think of everything 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.280
 let is nothing for the summer 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.420
 but probably looks absolutely 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.560
 great from the back there are still 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.780
 different variants up there with, for example 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.150
 single small lights 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.920
 different colors then we have each other 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.780
 closer to the middle chronically too 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.670
 running looks a bit like one 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.370
 diablo what you throw high with the string 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.630
 and I would catch that again 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.730
 most likely not 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.910
 I see one more in lego optics here 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.490
 to my right top so there they have 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.040
 guys really creativity at the day 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.950
 lay my mens 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.560
 So who in the States is who one 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.209
 bank account has what is proppevoll or there 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.070
 simple buck has to build something 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.260
 leave it and say fuck it what 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.000
 really want to have that should be 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.940
 the guys from scc in any case 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.959
 look and we'll see there are still 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.959
 a few more you want to show yourself
