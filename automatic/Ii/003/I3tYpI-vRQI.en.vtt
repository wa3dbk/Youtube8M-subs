00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.350 
energy from the coils and itself get
heated<00:02:09.850> up

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
heated up

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600 
heated up
now<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:10.869> continuous<00:02:11.470> heating<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.100> coil

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
now if continuous heating of this coil

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.010 
now if continuous heating of this coil
is<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:14.410> there<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.550> simultaneously<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
is is there then simultaneously the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.110 
is is there then simultaneously the
transform<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.739> oils<00:02:18.100> will<00:02:18.310> fill<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.790> pressure

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
transform of oils will fill up pressure

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.800 
transform of oils will fill up pressure
and<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.660> get<00:02:20.110> blast<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.180> purpose<00:02:22.600> we

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and get get blast for this purpose we

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.510 
and get get blast for this purpose we
have<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.110> conservative<00:02:23.860> tank<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.340> the
