 modern society is divided into five 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.980
 fraction of a teenager aged 16 years

 human quality

 the threshold of hard choices 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 having decided on the faction they are no longer 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.939
 shoals of the film so much that I could 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.829
 smash it into slivers but don't do it 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.229
 I will because it is for a teenager 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.450
 teenagers the film is very good 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.399
 about the direction I didnâ€™t notice that Neil 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.740
 Berger tensed I think that in the illusionist 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.719
 areas of darkness he showed himself better but 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.399
 I must say that the berger can put 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.709
 films for two true this time 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.259

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.899
 James, considering all of the above, I will say 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.210
 that the script is good about the plot 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 also all decent theme is not new but 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.340
 hard and not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.360
 shot down on the style of something like 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.519
 The Hunger Games 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.379
