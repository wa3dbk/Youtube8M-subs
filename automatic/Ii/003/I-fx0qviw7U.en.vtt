00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
but still it's not going to be quite

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.920 
but still it's not going to be quite
enough<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.909> really<00:05:02.030> make<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.300> difference<00:05:02.569> here

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
enough to really make a difference here

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.589 
enough to really make a difference here
that's<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.979> tempest<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.550> definitely<00:05:05.479> at<00:05:05.539> a

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
pretty big disadvantage here so

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.610 
pretty big disadvantage here so
especially<00:05:08.120> with<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.750> unit<00:05:08.990> reinforcements

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
especially with the unit reinforcements

especially with the unit reinforcements
coming<00:05:09.800> in<00:05:10.009> here<00:05:10.190> comes<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.520> second<00:05:10.969> colossi

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
coming in here comes a second colossi

and yep reaper you are absolutely
correct<00:05:14.389> what<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> comeback<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.800> would<00:05:16.099> agree

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
correct what a comeback I would agree

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.119 
correct what a comeback I would agree
this<00:05:16.669> is<00:05:16.729> an<00:05:16.969> amazing<00:05:17.240> game<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.830> looks<00:05:19.069> like

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
this is an amazing game it looks like

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.469 
this is an amazing game it looks like
port<00:05:19.460> was<00:05:19.610> going<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:19.849> go<00:05:19.969> ahead<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.240> do<00:05:20.449> a

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
port was going to go ahead and do a

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.180 
port was going to go ahead and do a
little<00:05:20.690> tech<00:05:20.990> rush<00:05:21.199> there<00:05:21.409> but<00:05:21.590> he<00:05:21.830> definitely

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
little tech rush there but he definitely

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.309 
little tech rush there but he definitely
switched<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:22.940> up<00:05:23.030> definitely<00:05:23.870> faked<00:05:24.139> out

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
switched it up definitely faked out

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.390 
switched it up definitely faked out
tempest<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.360> tempest<00:05:26.360> definitely

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
tempest and tempest definitely

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.409 
tempest and tempest definitely
definitely<00:05:28.400> think<00:05:28.909> this<00:05:29.029> game<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.210> going<00:05:29.360> to

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
definitely think this game is going to

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.790 
definitely think this game is going to
be<00:05:29.479> in<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.690> bag<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:30.050> board<00:05:30.289> where<00:05:30.500> but<00:05:30.680> we

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
be in the bag for board where but we

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.559 
be in the bag for board where but we
will<00:05:30.919> have<00:05:31.099> to<00:05:31.219> see<00:05:31.400> does<00:05:31.669> have<00:05:31.819> tempest<00:05:32.449> us

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
will have to see does have tempest us

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.240 
will have to see does have tempest us
have<00:05:32.719> a<00:05:32.779> couple<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.169> mortals<00:05:33.469> here<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:33.860> it

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
have a couple of mortals here and it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.290 
have a couple of mortals here and it
looks<00:05:34.279> like<00:05:34.490> he<00:05:34.580> does<00:05:34.699> have<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:34.969> one<00:05:35.150> day

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
looks like he does have the one day

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.700 
looks like he does have the one day
image<00:05:35.479> upgrade<00:05:35.840> so<00:05:36.080> it's<00:05:36.259> going<00:05:36.409> to<00:05:36.500> be<00:05:36.590> kind

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
image upgrade so it's going to be kind

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.100 
image upgrade so it's going to be kind
of<00:05:36.830> equaled<00:05:37.159> out<00:05:37.250> here<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.639> terms<00:05:37.849> of<00:05:38.110> damage

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
of equaled out here in terms of damage

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.839 
of equaled out here in terms of damage
going<00:05:39.349> back<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.650> forth<00:05:39.949> with<00:05:40.159> upgrades<00:05:40.610> but

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
going back and forth with upgrades but

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.339 
going back and forth with upgrades but
it<00:05:41.029> looks<00:05:41.210> like<00:05:41.270> port<00:05:41.569> where<00:05:41.719> is<00:05:41.900> going<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.259> go

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
it looks like port where is going to go

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.740 
it looks like port where is going to go
ahead<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.889> push<00:05:43.699> ahead<00:05:43.849> with<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.210> colossi

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
ahead and push ahead with the colossi

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.050 
ahead and push ahead with the colossi
and<00:05:45.080> i<00:05:45.770> like<00:05:46.099> i<00:05:46.219> said<00:05:46.400> i<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:46.550> this<00:05:46.849> game<00:05:47.000> is

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
and i like i said i think this game is

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.610 
and i like i said i think this game is
pretty<00:05:47.300> much<00:05:47.479> in<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.659> bag<00:05:47.719> we'll<00:05:47.900> have<00:05:48.289> to<00:05:48.409> see

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
pretty much in the bag we'll have to see

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.439 
pretty much in the bag we'll have to see
yep<00:05:48.919> especially<00:05:49.460> with<00:05:49.550> war<00:05:49.789> can<00:05:50.029> go<00:05:50.210> ahead<00:05:50.330> and

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
yep especially with war can go ahead and

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.689 
yep especially with war can go ahead and
take<00:05:50.659> this<00:05:50.810> as<00:05:51.500> high<00:05:51.710> yield<00:05:51.919> expansion<00:05:52.490> right

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
take this as high yield expansion right

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.379 
take this as high yield expansion right
here<00:05:53.500> looks<00:05:54.500> like<00:05:54.560> Borg<00:05:55.190> did<00:05:55.370> deny<00:05:55.669> tempest

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
here looks like Borg did deny tempest

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.110 
here looks like Borg did deny tempest
the<00:05:56.599> observer<00:05:57.379> scouting<00:05:57.919> although<00:05:58.789> Timbers

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
the observer scouting although Timbers

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.219 
the observer scouting although Timbers
probably<00:05:59.389> does<00:05:59.479> realize<00:05:59.779> just<00:06:00.020> how<00:06:00.139> much

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
probably does realize just how much

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.980 
probably does realize just how much
trouble<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.680> in<00:06:00.800> oh<00:06:00.949> so<00:06:01.879> many<00:06:01.940> zealots<00:06:02.419> vs.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
trouble is in oh so many zealots vs.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.869 
trouble is in oh so many zealots vs.
colossi<00:06:03.529> this<00:06:03.770> is<00:06:03.949> not<00:06:04.310> going<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.610> end<00:06:04.759> well

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
colossi this is not going to end well

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.180 
colossi this is not going to end well
for<00:06:05.000> tempest<00:06:05.569> I<00:06:05.750> think<00:06:06.409> this<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.770> pretty<00:06:07.039> much

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
for tempest I think this is pretty much

going to be in the bag here as these

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.040 
going to be in the bag here as these
outlets<00:06:09.710> were<00:06:09.889> decimated<00:06:10.520> by<00:06:11.029> the<00:06:11.479> colossi

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
outlets were decimated by the colossi

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.619 
outlets were decimated by the colossi

force reinforced with the stalkers in

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.089 
force reinforced with the stalkers in
the<00:06:14.840> centuries<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.409> yet<00:06:15.500> here<00:06:15.710> comes<00:06:15.919> a

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
the centuries and yet here comes a

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.800 
the centuries and yet here comes a
couple<00:06:16.729> extras<00:06:17.120> outlets<00:06:17.419> they're<00:06:17.599> going<00:06:17.719> to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
couple extras outlets they're going to

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.119 
couple extras outlets they're going to
try<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.020> turn<00:06:18.169> the<00:06:18.319> tide<00:06:18.469> but<00:06:18.620> unfortunately

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
try to turn the tide but unfortunately

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.999 
try to turn the tide but unfortunately
it<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.370> not<00:06:19.400> going<00:06:19.789> to<00:06:19.879> be<00:06:19.969> enough<00:06:20.469> and<00:06:21.469> I<00:06:21.710> think

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
it is not going to be enough and I think

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.469 
it is not going to be enough and I think
this<00:06:22.129> is<00:06:22.279> pretty<00:06:22.490> much<00:06:22.610> just<00:06:22.909> going<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> be<00:06:23.240> GG

for tempest here it looks like is a

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.860 
for tempest here it looks like is a
cycle<00:06:27.529> or<00:06:27.620> is<00:06:27.740> going<00:06:27.919> to<00:06:28.039> go<00:06:28.129> down<00:06:28.159> on<00:06:28.870> those
