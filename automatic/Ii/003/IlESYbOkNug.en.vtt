sure all your graphical features are

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.330 
sure all your graphical features are
featured<00:04:46.450> on<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.560> make<00:04:47.950> sure<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.220> do

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
featured on that so make sure you do

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.880 
featured on that so make sure you do
that<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.790> now<00:04:49.150> let's<00:04:49.510> do<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:52.620> it's<00:04:53.620> going<00:04:53.830> to

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
that and now let's do this it's going to

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.970 
that and now let's do this it's going to
make<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.160> pick<00:04:55.090> your<00:04:55.360> face<00:04:55.630> mirror<00:04:56.500> flipped

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
make the pick your face mirror flipped

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.400 
make the pick your face mirror flipped
so<00:04:57.430> this<00:04:57.760> would<00:04:57.910> be<00:04:57.940> flipped<00:04:58.360> in<00:04:59.169> another

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
so this would be flipped in another

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.110 
so this would be flipped in another
direction<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> that's<00:05:01.630> fine

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.780 

tilt<00:05:06.780> your<00:05:06.840> head<00:05:07.110> inside<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.830> square<00:05:08.250> as<00:05:08.580> you

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
could previously then turn your head 90

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.010 
could previously then turn your head 90
degrees<00:05:12.060> toward<00:05:12.389> your<00:05:12.600> left<00:05:12.630> shoulder

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
degrees toward your left shoulder
