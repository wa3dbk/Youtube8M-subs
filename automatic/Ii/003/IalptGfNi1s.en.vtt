along<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.980> other<00:02:28.129> side<00:02:28.659> those<00:02:29.659> 12<00:02:30.370> 13<00:02:31.370> 14<00:02:32.030> and

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
along the other side those 12 13 14 and

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.199 
along the other side those 12 13 14 and
then<00:02:34.909> on<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> bottom<00:02:35.299> side<00:02:36.790> gives<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.879> up<00:02:38.030> to

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
then on the bottom side gives you up to

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.270 
then on the bottom side gives you up to
15<00:02:38.810> 16<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:40.879> that<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.299> hiding<00:02:41.780> was

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
15 16 and the one that was hiding was

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.660 
15 16 and the one that was hiding was
under<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.519> plate<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.970> top<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
under the plate on top this one was the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.339 
under the plate on top this one was the
toughest<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.150> get<00:02:47.299> out<00:02:47.420> by<00:02:47.569> far<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.170> how<00:02:48.290> to

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
toughest to get out by far it's how to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.619 
toughest to get out by far it's how to
do<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> hand<00:02:48.890> screwdriver<00:02:49.480> as<00:02:50.480> it

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
do it with the hand screwdriver as it

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.119 
do it with the hand screwdriver as it
might<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:50.870> stripped<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.680> Phillips

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
might have stripped out the Phillips

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.160 
might have stripped out the Phillips
head<00:02:52.810> once<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.049> those<00:02:54.290> are<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:55.690> it'll<00:02:56.690> come

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
head once all those are out it'll come

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.839 
head once all those are out it'll come
apart<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.590> little<00:02:57.680> easy<00:02:57.980> right<00:02:58.340> here<00:02:58.579> at<00:02:58.730> this

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
apart a little easy right here at this

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.649 
apart a little easy right here at this
five<00:02:59.349> all<00:03:00.349> right<00:03:00.500> got<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.489> popped<00:03:02.450> open

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
five all right got this popped open

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.860 
five all right got this popped open
there<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> trapper<00:03:05.299> we'll<00:03:05.750> be

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
there this is the trapper we'll be

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
there this is the trapper we'll be
replacing<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:07.250> very<00:03:07.700> simple<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.180> get<00:03:08.299> these

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
replacing it's very simple to get these

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.979 
replacing it's very simple to get these
wires<00:03:08.720> off<00:03:09.019> just<00:03:09.260> press<00:03:09.709> down<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:11.810> it

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
wires off just press down and then it

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.140 
wires off just press down and then it
will<00:03:12.109> slip<00:03:12.409> right<00:03:12.650> out<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.879> see<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> little

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
will slip right out you can see a little

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.210 
will slip right out you can see a little
better<00:03:14.329> when<00:03:14.540> do<00:03:14.659> this<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.040> wire

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
better when do this one and this wire

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.000 
better when do this one and this wire
has<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> black<00:03:16.760> stripe<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.889> that's<00:03:18.889> an

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
has a black stripe on it and that's an

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.650 
has a black stripe on it and that's an
indicator<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.579> will<00:03:19.760> connect<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
indicator it will connect to that the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.379 
indicator it will connect to that the
black<00:03:20.900> pin<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.329> press<00:03:23.599> down<00:03:25.180> slide<00:03:26.180> right

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
black pin so you press down slide right

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.940 
black pin so you press down slide right
out

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.220 

to<00:03:30.910> get<00:03:31.030> these<00:03:31.180> screws<00:03:31.540> off<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:32.050> going<00:03:32.170> to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to get these screws off it's going to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980 
to get these screws off it's going to
take<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> seven<00:03:33.450> sixty<00:03:34.450> fourths

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
take a seven sixty fourths

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.180 
take a seven sixty fourths
Tex<00:03:36.030> might<00:03:37.030> be<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.209> metric<00:03:37.600> one<00:03:37.810> that's<00:03:38.190> that

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
Tex might be a metric one that's that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.120 
Tex might be a metric one that's that
works<00:03:39.370> also<00:03:40.110> I'll<00:03:41.110> take<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.440> off<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.680> get

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
works also I'll take this off and get

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.670 
works also I'll take this off and get
back<00:03:42.310> with<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.750> all<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:43.810> here's<00:03:44.140> our<00:03:44.230> final

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
back with you all right here's our final

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.120 
back with you all right here's our final
step<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:46.000> four<00:03:46.330> screws<00:03:46.570> are<00:03:46.810> out<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.290> three

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
step all four screws are out a three

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.970 
step all four screws are out a three
millimeters<00:03:48.850> was<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.570> better<00:03:50.140> size<00:03:50.500> for<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
millimeters was a better size for the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.370 
millimeters was a better size for the
hex<00:03:51.190> screw<00:03:51.850> driver<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.390> 764<00:03:55.390> was

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
hex screw driver but the the 764 was

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.680 
hex screw driver but the the 764 was
working<00:03:56.830> for<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.400> most<00:03:57.520> part<00:03:57.820> all<00:03:58.360> right<00:03:58.480> so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
working for the most part all right so

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.979 
working for the most part all right so
lift<00:03:59.230> off<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.650> assembly<00:04:00.480> here's<00:04:01.480> our<00:04:01.780> bad

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
lift off this assembly here's our bad

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:10.610 
lift off this assembly here's our bad
driver<00:04:06.000> carefully<00:04:07.000> lift<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.390> out<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.600> there

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.729 

and<00:04:11.620> then<00:04:12.489> our<00:04:13.470> new<00:04:14.470> one<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.419> I

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
and then our new one and that is it I

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.780 
and then our new one and that is it I
think<00:04:20.739> some<00:04:21.040> of<00:04:21.070> these<00:04:21.190> might<00:04:21.400> come<00:04:21.430> with<00:04:21.730> a

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
think some of these might come with a

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.840 
think some of these might come with a
small<00:04:22.470> thin<00:04:23.470> layer<00:04:23.650> plastic<00:04:24.220> over<00:04:24.460> them<00:04:24.610> but

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
small thin layer plastic over them but

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.960 
small thin layer plastic over them but
this<00:04:25.030> one<00:04:25.290> does<00:04:26.290> not<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:29.290> just<00:04:29.730> put<00:04:30.730> it<00:04:30.820> back

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
this one does not and just put it back

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.659 
this one does not and just put it back
together<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.600> same<00:04:31.810> way<00:04:32.050> took<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.160> apart<00:04:33.430> I

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
together in the same way took it apart I

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.790 
together in the same way took it apart I
hope<00:04:34.120> this<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.419> helpful<00:04:34.690> tutorial<00:04:35.380> for<00:04:35.650> you
