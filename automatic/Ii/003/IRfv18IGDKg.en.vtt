that<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.619> checking<00:01:58.890> goal<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.880> can't<00:02:00.119> quite

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that is checking goal and I can't quite

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
was I can't remember if it was that is
it<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.740> even<00:02:05.040> better<00:02:05.369> doubtful<00:02:05.909> because

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it is even better doubtful because

formation<00:02:44.849> but<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.719> wanted<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.109> rest<00:02:46.349> one

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
formation but then I wanted to rest one

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.899 
formation but then I wanted to rest one
of<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:46.739> strikers<00:02:47.159> because<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.519> was<00:02:47.609> get<00:02:47.760> long

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
of my strikers because it was get long

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.670 
of my strikers because it was get long
fitness<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.629> still<00:02:49.230> wanted<00:02:49.439> to<00:02:49.500> keep<00:02:49.620> my

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
fitness so I still wanted to keep my

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.409 
fitness so I still wanted to keep my
wing<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> went<00:02:50.939> for<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.150> different

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
wing is so I went for a different

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.740 
wing is so I went for a different
formation<00:02:51.780> i<00:02:51.840> went<00:02:51.989> for<00:02:52.370> 451<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:54.599> actually

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
formation i went for 451 and it actually

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.409 
formation i went for 451 and it actually
works<00:02:55.439> really<00:02:55.739> well<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.819> set

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
works really well and I think the set

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.839 
works really well and I think the set
the<00:02:57.810> sentiment<00:02:58.469> or<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:58.859> yeah<00:02:59.189> the<00:02:59.310> CDM<00:02:59.699> is

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
the sentiment or just yeah the CDM is

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.369 
the sentiment or just yeah the CDM is
actually<00:03:00.120> playing<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.449> sentiment<00:03:00.930> but

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
actually playing in the sentiment but

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
the best team and it's obviously not the

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.610 
this series so far has been really
really<00:04:15.090> good<00:04:15.560> here<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.949> CD<00:04:17.280> him<00:04:17.549> again<00:04:17.969> and

31st minute putting put myself tuning up

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.529 
31st minute putting put myself tuning up
I<00:06:00.050> knew<00:06:00.289> his<00:06:00.710> team<00:06:00.919> would<00:06:01.039> be<00:06:01.159> dangerous

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
I knew his team would be dangerous

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.570 
I knew his team would be dangerous
because<00:06:02.539> he<00:06:02.810> had<00:06:02.930> that<00:06:03.110> pace<00:06:03.380> up<00:06:03.590> front<00:06:03.830> but<00:06:04.280> in

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
because he had that pace up front but in

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.399 
because he had that pace up front but in
just<00:06:05.000> before<00:06:05.090> half-time<00:06:05.449> I<00:06:05.810> get<00:06:06.020> them<00:06:06.199> I

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
just before half-time I get them I

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.499 
just before half-time I get them I
managed<00:06:07.159> to<00:06:07.190> win<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.400> penalty<00:06:07.699> because<00:06:08.090> he

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
managed to win a penalty because he

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.180 
managed to win a penalty because he
fouled<00:06:08.840> me<00:06:08.930> obviously<00:06:09.139> in<00:06:09.409> the<00:06:09.469> box<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:09.889> gets

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
fouled me obviously in the box and gets

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.640 
fouled me obviously in the box and gets
a<00:06:10.310> yellow<00:06:10.460> not<00:06:10.759> red<00:06:10.789> but<00:06:11.719> I'm<00:06:11.960> he<00:06:12.169> does<00:06:12.320> save

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
a yellow not red but I'm he does save

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.529 
a yellow not red but I'm he does save
this<00:06:12.860> so<00:06:13.219> at<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:13.849> same<00:06:14.000> time<00:06:14.150> was<00:06:14.300> thinking

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
this so at the same time was thinking

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.689 
this so at the same time was thinking
you<00:06:14.599> know<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.719> can't<00:06:15.199> I<00:06:15.409> can't<00:06:15.620> slack<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.340> cannot

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
slap because it's what happens and as

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.080 
slap because it's what happens and as
soon<00:06:18.949> as<00:06:19.070> he<00:06:19.130> makes<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.340> bit<00:06:19.430> space<00:06:19.669> tried<00:06:19.969> to

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
soon as he makes a bit space tried to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.939 
soon as he makes a bit space tried to
play<00:06:20.270> him<00:06:20.419> off<00:06:20.509> side<00:06:20.810> but<00:06:21.110> he<00:06:21.259> got<00:06:21.650> through<00:06:21.830> and

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
he has too much pace ready for me to

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.390 
he has too much pace ready for me to
handle<00:06:23.419> he<00:06:23.960> shoots<00:06:24.139> across<00:06:24.320> goal<00:06:24.710> and<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.219> goes

in quite a simple goal for him nothing

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.350 
in quite a simple goal for him nothing
too<00:06:27.830> complicated<00:06:28.190> but<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.729> was<00:06:28.820> very<00:06:28.880> rare<00:06:29.330> i

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
too complicated but it was very rare i

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.640 
too complicated but it was very rare i
was<00:06:29.570> defending<00:06:29.990> really<00:06:30.199> well<00:06:30.349> not<00:06:30.530> only

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
was defending really well not only

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.469 
was defending really well not only
attacking<00:06:31.310> but<00:06:31.580> defending<00:06:31.909> really<00:06:32.090> well<00:06:32.240> here

i<00:06:32.659> will<00:06:33.169> have<00:06:33.469> the<00:06:33.500> option<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.860> cross<00:06:34.130> in<00:06:34.339> and

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
i will have the option to cross in and

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.070 
i will have the option to cross in and
instead<00:06:34.789> of<00:06:34.909> crossing<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.270> in<00:06:35.360> i<00:06:35.419> took<00:06:35.630> shots<00:06:35.900> i

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
instead of crossing it in i took shots i

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.450 
instead of crossing it in i took shots i
knew<00:06:36.229> i<00:06:36.260> would<00:06:36.529> have<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:36.830> ability<00:06:37.159> to<00:06:37.190> win<00:06:37.400> a

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
knew i would have the ability to win a

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.590 
knew i would have the ability to win a
corner<00:06:37.699> and

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
corner and

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.240 
corner and
the<00:06:38.660> corner<00:06:38.930> goal<00:06:39.110> goes<00:06:39.410> in<00:06:39.680> you<00:06:39.770> know<00:06:39.920> how

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
the corner goal goes in you know how

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.940 
the corner goal goes in you know how
overpowered<00:06:40.940> corners<00:06:41.270> arm<00:06:41.450> if<00:06:42.170> you<00:06:42.410> get<00:06:42.830> into

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
overpowered corners arm if you get into

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.070 
overpowered corners arm if you get into
that<00:06:43.100> kind<00:06:43.310> of<00:06:43.370> position<00:06:43.670> taking<00:06:44.540> a<00:06:44.600> shot<00:06:44.870> is

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
that kind of position taking a shot is

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.780 
that kind of position taking a shot is
always<00:06:45.650> a<00:06:45.680> good<00:06:45.830> option<00:06:45.920> because<00:06:46.130> you're

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
always a good option because you're

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.790 
always a good option because you're
you're<00:06:47.090> quite<00:06:47.690> often<00:06:47.990> going<00:06:48.470> to<00:06:48.560> win<00:06:48.710> the

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
you're quite often going to win the

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.620 
you're quite often going to win the
corner<00:06:49.100> which<00:06:49.520> is<00:06:49.670> basically<00:06:49.970> like<00:06:50.090> crossing

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
corner which is basically like crossing

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.940 
corner which is basically like crossing
so<00:06:50.780> you're<00:06:50.930> having<00:06:51.020> a<00:06:51.170> shot<00:06:51.380> and<00:06:51.560> you<00:06:51.650> get<00:06:51.830> in<00:06:51.890> a

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
so you're having a shot and you get in a

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.650 
so you're having a shot and you get in a
corner<00:06:52.220> it's<00:06:52.550> a<00:06:52.610> lot<00:06:52.790> better<00:06:52.940> option<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.450> take

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
corner it's a lot better option to take

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.840 
corner it's a lot better option to take
anyway<00:06:54.530> as<00:06:54.860> you<00:06:54.890> see<00:06:55.130> I<00:06:55.160> got<00:06:55.340> fouled<00:06:55.610> they're
