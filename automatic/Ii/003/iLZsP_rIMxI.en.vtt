00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
latest version it goes to dark Alex calm
and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.649> guess<00:02:01.920> he<00:02:02.069> just<00:02:02.250> puts<00:02:02.429> her<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.789> for

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and I guess he just puts her in them for

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
and I guess he just puts her in them for
a<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.209> number<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.599> there<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.929> then<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
a more a number in there and then it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.779 
a more a number in there and then it
will<00:02:04.259> say<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.679> okay<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.130> updated<00:02:05.670> or

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.809 
will say you're okay you're updated or
not<00:02:05.880> anyway<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.709> this<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.130> PlayStation

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.610 
see the major difference which was the
first<00:04:49.010> difference<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.460> saw<00:04:49.669> that<00:04:50.330> bar<00:04:50.720> let's<00:04:51.470> at

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
first difference I saw that bar let's at

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.520 
first difference I saw that bar let's at
the<00:04:51.770> bottom<00:04:52.100> he<00:04:52.729> dropped<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.150> down<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.360> big<00:04:54.320> law

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
the bottom he dropped it down a big law

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.659 
the bottom he dropped it down a big law
now<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:57.260> next<00:04:57.530> main<00:04:57.710> difference<00:04:58.100> is<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.280> if

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
now the next main difference is that if

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.520 
now the next main difference is that if
you<00:04:58.760> go<00:04:58.910> into<00:04:59.060> advanced<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:02.720> go<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.900> advanced

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
you go into advanced you go to advanced

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.800 
you go into advanced you go to advanced

decided<00:05:56.460> remove<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.940> now<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.600> only<00:05:57.810> issue

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
decided remove that now the only issue

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.660 
decided remove that now the only issue
now<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:58.440> if<00:05:58.650> you<00:05:58.710> have<00:05:58.800> too<00:05:58.950> many<00:05:59.100> you

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
now is that if you have too many you

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.820 
now is that if you have too many you
start<00:05:59.940> hiding<00:06:00.030> behind<00:06:00.270> that<00:06:00.420> toolbar<00:06:00.900> or<00:06:01.110> they

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
start hiding behind that toolbar or they

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.970 
start hiding behind that toolbar or they
start<00:06:02.130> coming<00:06:02.340> down<00:06:02.760> right<00:06:03.750> over<00:06:03.990> like<00:06:04.680> down

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
start coming down right over like down

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.370 
start coming down right over like down
here<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.490> start<00:06:05.910> piling<00:06:06.780> up<00:06:06.930> again<00:06:07.200> if<00:06:07.320> you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
here and start piling up again if you

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.500 
here and start piling up again if you
have<00:06:07.470> enough<00:06:07.770> down<00:06:08.370> here<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:09.030> covers<00:06:09.390> all

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
have enough down here and it covers all

have enough down here and it covers all
the<00:06:09.630> other<00:06:09.750> ones<00:06:10.640> so<00:06:11.640> I<00:06:11.670> kind<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.480> told<00:06:12.630> this<00:06:12.780> to

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
the other ones so I kind of told this to

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.080 
the other ones so I kind of told this to
