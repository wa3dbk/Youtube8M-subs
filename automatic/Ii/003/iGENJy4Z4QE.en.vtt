for<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> trickiest<00:00:30.119> part<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
for it this is the trickiest part of the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.810 
for it this is the trickiest part of the
glitch<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.050> once<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.009> all

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
glitch but once you get it on there all

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
glitch but once you get it on there all
you're<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.420> you're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> walk

you're gonna do is you're going to walk

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
you're gonna do is you're going to walk
up<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.680> while<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.640> down<00:00:35.850> you're<00:00:36.270> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
up and while it's going down you're just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.410 
up and while it's going down you're just
going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.890> hold<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.010> X<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.640> square<00:00:39.000> depending

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
going to hold down X or square depending

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
going to hold down X or square depending
which<00:00:39.510> console<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
which console you're on and well it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
which console you're on and well it
should<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.360> should<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.840> like

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
should do is it should kind of like

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.569 
should do is it should kind of like
breach<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.160> down<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
breach you through you can go down you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
breach you through you can go down you
can<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> floorboards

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
can kind of see through the floorboards

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
can kind of see through the floorboards
if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> stop<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.090> can

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
if you if you want to stop there you can

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
if you if you want to stop there you can
just<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> shoot<00:00:48.809> people's<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:50.070> legs

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
just kind of shoot people's like legs

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.450 
just kind of shoot people's like legs
and<00:00:50.640> stuff<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> also<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:53.100> down<00:00:53.250> again

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and stuff but you can also go down again

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
and stuff but you can also go down again
if<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> correctly<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.739> cannot

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
if you do it correctly and you cannot

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
if you do it correctly and you cannot
under<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> map<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.079> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
under the map and from there you can

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
under the map and from there you can
actually<00:00:58.649> shoot<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.980> couple<00:00:59.129> different<00:00:59.370> areas

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
actually shoot a couple different areas

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
actually shoot a couple different areas
like<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> couple<00:01:00.899> stairways<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:02.460> couple

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
like a couple stairways and a couple

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
like a couple stairways and a couple
other<00:01:02.850> spots<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> that's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
other spots like that and that's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
other spots like that and that's
probably<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.320> favorite<00:01:04.680> part<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
probably my favorite part on on this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
probably my favorite part on on this
glitch<00:01:06.540> personally<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.860> actually

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
glitch personally but you can actually

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.990 
glitch personally but you can actually
go<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:09.170> up<00:01:10.369> like<00:01:11.369> above<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
go all the way around up like above the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.679 
go all the way around up like above the
deploy<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> generator<00:01:13.650> thingamajigger

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
deploy like the generator thingamajigger

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
deploy like the generator thingamajigger
but<00:01:15.689> you're<00:01:16.650> pretty<00:01:16.860> much<00:01:17.100> open<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> getting

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but you're pretty much open to getting

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
but you're pretty much open to getting
killed<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.770> didn't

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
killed if you do that and I didn't

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
killed if you do that and I didn't
really<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.460> spot<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.060> much<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:22.110> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
really like that spot as much you can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
really like that spot as much you can
also<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.950> side<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.640> i<00:01:23.700> think

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
also do it on the other side but i think

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.200 
also do it on the other side but i think
the<00:01:24.150> site<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.780> easier<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:27.060> up

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the site is a little bit easier it's up

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
the site is a little bit easier it's up
to<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:27.810> side<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.799> uh

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to you guys which side you it on but uh

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.649 
to you guys which side you it on but uh
really<00:01:29.430> go<00:01:29.549> try<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
really go try it out it's one of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
really go try it out it's one of the
