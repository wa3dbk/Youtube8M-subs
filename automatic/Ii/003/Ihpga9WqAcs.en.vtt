00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.580
 imagine that they name you boss of a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.559
 great company and the first day of work 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.040
 you discover that the box is totally 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:15.430
 empty and that there are more than 245,000 invoices 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.670
 without paying a total of 1,600 million debt 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.190
 that between 2007 and 2011 four companies 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.650
 closed every day and the unemployment rate 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.870
 had almost tripled going from an 8 to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.060
 21 percent 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.760
 They want to resign and run 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.950
 Truth then, instead of going out 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.860
 running we went to work to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.750
 work hard and fast to pay 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.060
 to all providers so that they do not 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.239
 suspended services and did not have 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.400
 to keep firing more employees 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.140
 faced with this dramatic situation we had 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.420
 two mandatory objectives for 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.300
 reactivate the economy first of all 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.600
 stop the stoppage and the second create 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 job 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.820
 and that's what we did now Balearic 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.879
 it is the only community that accumulates 28 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.640
 consecutive months reducing unemployment 32 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.580
 months youth unemployment and 17 months the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.890
 long-term we also carry 22 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 months in a row creating net employment and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.229
 we are the leading community in increment 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.610
 of affiliation to social security 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.440
 We are leaders in business creation 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.690
 with the highest increase since 2010 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.570
 the first community in increase of high 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.480
 of self - employed leaders in increasing 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.820
 retail sales 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.970
 the autonomy that more business increase 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.530
 and of employment has in the service sector 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.250
 leaders in sales increase of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.090
 housing exports grow 13 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.260
 as 9% in 2013 foreign investment 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.870
 it grew a 365 7 percent with respect 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.660
 to 2010 and many more results 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.910
 important thanks to the great 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.270
 effort of all we manage to stop the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.120
 deceleration in 2011 in 2012 we achieved 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.530
 reverse the trend and in 2013 Balearic 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.930
 grew 0 3% in 2014 the estimate is 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.420
 that will have grown 1 percent and the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.660
 experts suggest that in 2015 they will grow 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.730
 more than double is good news but 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.770
 before starting to celebrate it we still 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.410
 Much work remains to be done and many 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.600
 unemployed people to help if 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.860
 you want to know how we're going to do it come in
