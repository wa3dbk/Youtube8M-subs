00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 environmental saev is responsible for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.389
 supply of treated water for all 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 votuporanga's residents 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 two forms of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.170
 capture this water in a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.720
 surface with withdrawal of stream 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 sailor and underground 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.460
 with stations connected to the GuaranÃ­ aquifer 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.320
 one of the largest springs in the world 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.160
 Let's know a little more about how 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.930
 one of these deep wells works 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 located in the north zone and votuporanga 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 with a capacity of 480 thousand liters per 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.180
 time of flow and responsible for 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 supply 27% of the city 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 we will follow the complex work of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:03.449
 I repair when the station suffers some 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 problem in March 2013 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.640
 teams of the municipality detected 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.950
 electrical panels that light well 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 was no longer an employee. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.180
 pumping water to the surface 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.390
 this pumping is done by a series 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.270
 of equipment weighing 23 gilt 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.170
 that give force to a vertical pump of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 axis located at 177 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 meters deep 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.400
 the axles that turn the pump 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 in the rubber of the bearings with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.329
 the 450-horsepower electric motor does not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.250
 he had the strength to turn the kiss and went 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.250
 automatically disarmed 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.220
 the environmental saev then began 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.140
 The equipment exchange process was 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.760
 hired a crane with 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.860
 to collect objects up to 30 tons 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.290
 the first step was to withdraw 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.070
 all equipment starting with the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.580
 motor 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.800
 the bearing housing and the head after the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.440
 withdrawal from this set begins the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.770
 work inside the well with the withdrawal 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.950
 of 10-inch columns positioned 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.160
 every three meters fastened by bolts 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:25.510
 in total there were 57 by ballot boxes 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.510
 fifty-seven axles and 57 washers 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.190
 a welding company gave the support 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:40.000
 cutting the screws were 1026 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.500
 screws and 2051 doors after release 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.710
 of these equipment 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.190
 you get to the pumping station and Saturday from the well 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.610
 the cranes were cleaned and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.370
 answers and placed one by one at each 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.590
 three meters with new screws 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.300
 a shift service was also made 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.300
 to rectify the washers 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.420
 all this done they put head 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.450
 motor bearing box and has start 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.910
 the cleaning process where it is thrown away 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.670
 all the water gets dirty because of the time 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.340
 after approximately 15 minutes at 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.230
 water becomes clean again and the well is 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.230
 sealed to restart supply 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.090
 throughout the exchange process 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.459
 the population is served with diverted water 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.540
 systems in the southern and 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.790
 central 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.510
 the entire process from the detection of 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.120
 problem until the solution took seven days and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.110
 demanded the outline of 12 employees 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.840
 autarchy 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.450
 a mechanical engineer hired in addition to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.319
 welding and crane company 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.260
 environmental saev is so it works with 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.680
 committed team dedicated to 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.970
 quality water to 100% of the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.970
 votuporanga's residents
