00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
first of all it was in my budget

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.310 
first of all it was in my budget
titanium<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:56.600> twenty<00:01:57.600> dollars<00:01:58.020> or

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
titanium was like twenty dollars or

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.540 
titanium was like twenty dollars or
thirty<00:01:58.770> bucks<00:01:59.009> extra<00:01:59.540> chai<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.810> no<00:02:01.049> way

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
thirty bucks extra chai was like no way

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.300 
thirty bucks extra chai was like no way
but<00:02:02.480> it's<00:02:03.280> right<00:02:04.280> now<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:06.070> pretty<00:02:07.070> good

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
but it's right now it's a pretty good

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.160 
but it's right now it's a pretty good
condition<00:02:07.520> obviously<00:02:08.030> because<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.690> just<00:02:08.750> body

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
condition obviously because I just body

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
condition obviously because I just body
blades<00:02:09.770> are<00:02:09.979> pretty<00:02:10.369> sharp<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.710> it's<00:02:12.950> got

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
blades are pretty sharp and so it's got

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.910 
blades are pretty sharp and so it's got
the<00:02:13.370> smooth<00:02:13.910> edge<00:02:14.330> blade<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the smooth edge blade the in the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.040 
the smooth edge blade the in the
serrated<00:02:16.280> edge<00:02:16.640> blade<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.450> don't<00:02:17.750> exactly

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
serrated edge blade and I don't exactly

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.040 
serrated edge blade and I don't exactly
know<00:02:18.260> what<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.650> part<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.100> right<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:19.670> right

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
know what this part is right here right

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.120 
know what this part is right here right
here<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.340> um<00:02:23.410> obvious<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> be

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
here but um obvious it's going to be

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
here but um obvious it's going to be
useful<00:02:25.280> i<00:02:25.730> guess<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:27.170> um<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:30.050> some

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.760 
useful i guess but um so I got some
accessories<00:02:31.070> for<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.720> besides<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.110> KC<00:02:33.670> ok

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
which I like how it looks black and it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.200

looks pretty tactical so I got these
with<00:02:44.600> these<00:02:45.170> two<00:02:45.470> things<00:02:45.740> they're<00:02:46.430> rubber

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
with these two things they're rubber

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.130 
with these two things they're rubber
yeah<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:51.200> right<00:02:51.640> here<00:02:52.960> so<00:02:53.960> they're

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
yeah going like right here so they're

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.800 
yeah going like right here so they're
like<00:02:55.180> fasteners<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.950> fasten<00:02:57.950> on<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.810> guess

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
like fasteners to a fasten on I guess

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.850 
like fasteners to a fasten on I guess
like<00:03:00.590> you're<00:03:01.040> diving<00:03:01.550> gear<00:03:02.000> or<00:03:02.410> backpack<00:03:03.410> or

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
like you're diving gear or backpack or

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.490 
like you're diving gear or backpack or
anything<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.870> guess

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
anything like that and so that's I guess

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.110 
anything like that and so that's I guess
I<00:03:09.980> guess<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.459> sums<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.060> up<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:12.560> um<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.670> forgot

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
I guess that sums it up but um I forgot

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.240 
I guess that sums it up but um I forgot
what<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.380> tell<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.709> brain<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.340> was<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:19.010> you

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
