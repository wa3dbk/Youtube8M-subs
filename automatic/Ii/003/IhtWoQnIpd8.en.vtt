so I'm told and that of course does make

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.000 
so I'm told and that of course does make
sense<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.500> insane<00:00:58.500> person

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
sense because what insane person

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670

releases a game on the thirty-first of
the<00:01:01.800> 12th<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> almost<00:01:04.439> certainly<00:01:04.880> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the 12th so that is almost certainly you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
the 12th so that is almost certainly you
know<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> date<00:01:06.600> 23rd<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> October<00:01:08.250> well

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's quite reasonable I was predicting

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
that's quite reasonable I was predicting
october<00:01:11.490> november<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:12.900> time<00:01:13.110> to
