00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.099
 hi I am kq that who speaks to you 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.080
 practically connecting is not there 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 I will only show this one this time 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.330
 bet and then build a blade 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 in the last video there is a hooked 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 shopping that we built this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.439
 the classroom together and nova with the video in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.960
 direct let's say and as you can see 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.240
 lacked coordinates for forward pulls and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.800
 aluminum plates for enter on 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.300
 arm and so the hooked part vi 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.300
 will need some aluminum like this 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 this point the only one to see this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.309
 part that is missing is built here 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.809
 this this wrapper in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.510
 another macerated but did not go to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.980
 to end 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.980
 and then you will need screws and bolts 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 now now see the sheet again 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 of aluminum and traced with a pen 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.840
 even better with a felt pen 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.180
 these lines if you want to see 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.750
 they will practically serve as for 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.909
 guideline to cut the hook 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.869
 this one is 4 centimeters long 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 this too is the one here 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.360
 on this one this mixes this side 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.210
 my and i's width depends on the blade 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 3 and 3 centimeters therefore had to do 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.750
 a little smaller the two and a half I believe 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.729
 be a little more beautiful but I don't know is not 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.659
 what as aesthetic x does not matter 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.470
 much this unfortunately this then 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.320
 part here like this is long 5 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.930
 centimeters this is 2 centimeters e 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.439
 half as always this spaced that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.380
 see in the middle is nothing but a 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.869
 the access part of the party that if 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.630
 these holes must be bent 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.189
 will serve for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.689
 to put screws and bolts on it 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.509
 we were when we will have it once 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.500
 clipped to cut it we will use the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.970
 usually 3m is once clipped where it is 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.610
 keep something like this you can see 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.550
 there is this culture inward but 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 this only in aesthetic function therefore 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.610
 the output will not worry but 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.720
 however sometimes do use one 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.890
 very simple there but it seems that the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.080
 roads that I made this sort of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.950
 curvature inward I like e 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.630
 I did it once I got it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.580
 be e-mail take a little bit me 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.440
 don't worry bookies don't seem to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.130
 practically cancels out of 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 aluminum so thickness 2 mm more or less 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.690
 hence the width width of this 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 little space here in the middle then put it here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.510
 put one and then put them in the living 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.079
 so in death you get a grip then you have 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.519
 put me in this position 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:03.000
 once put in the grip as you like 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.410
 I gave him this shape as you can 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.079
 see this object pass perfectly 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.170
 here in the middle as we see as expected 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.480
 and this is the piece now there 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.220
 it only remains to do it to put it then one 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.350
 once finished as you can see we have 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:26.130
 or attached to the old but how 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.049
 you can see I have attached the part 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.850
 hooked if we want to do some tests 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.090
 is a bit cesar gas and hooks have the 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.090
 objects 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.360
 he certainly cannot bear all the weight 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.870
 of a man like in the video game but not 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.989
 I can, however, enough weight now I want 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.159
 do a bit of cazzeggiano I see the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.480
 my first is the facade I have 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.519
 built this crap here it is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.580
 this beautiful crap that would be the ex 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.640
 the taqwa left hand that sucks everything will come 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.319
 rust toe this one reminds him of one 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.530
 broom practically those of iron for 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.750
 testing the leaves so it worked 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.230
 practically worked by hand movement 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.230
 annual 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.079
 this to know if such will remain 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.990
 vaccinated they come to macerate it was 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.030
 so there is what has been this 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.100
 here there is another bolt there 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.610
 tender we make peace so that he does not know 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.840
 we moved this had that cona 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.490
 I concealed and then I tried it anyway been 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.960
 now thinking about doing it works 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.949
 like that of connor would be that yes 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.510
 turns tired I still work if 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.080
 you want to keep up to date in ours 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.900
 projects 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.320
 however I tell you that maybe they are not 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.320
 sure if it falls build after try 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:59.099
 to make a ramona macerated utf that 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.780
 practically it works works better than 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.830
 this is a bit more expensive but not 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.330
 a lot and often this one here though and 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.840
 it's worth our if he will succeed at 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.720
 do it because I do n't know if it will come if you 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.669
 work on important case try if 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.710
 you never try if you never know 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:22.800
 fails it is good then we say goodbye 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.740
 written if you liked the video 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.240
 chat and if you want to see how it is done 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.110
 part let's say from the complete recchia 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.530
 here it is 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.530
 I'll take it right away 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.949
 it's not that good old water 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.440
 fall well we say perfect without having 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.180
 almost ago I will get the link at the end 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.120
 of the video 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.889
 if yes, if you want these follow all
