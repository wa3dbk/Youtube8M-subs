00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.339
 two big eggplant that one 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.920
 Just what we like to eat if I am one 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.550

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.830
 no wonder you I would cook 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.189
 hope 2 so first I will the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.820
 cut off the stalk and put the aubergine in 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:39.629
 Traces peel so partially not 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.809
 whole and then cuts them in so 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.710
 slices 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 These are thicker slices 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.190
 put the eggplants in salt water 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.840
 and resisted the juice of half a lemon 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.540
 to give up 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.850
 So be it so far that's 1100 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.250
 euro appeared goes out and lemon 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.380
 so that the color is preserved otherwise 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.260
 they turn brown and let them be 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.030
 about 15 minutes here in the salt water 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.010
 in it 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.150
 then we need about 500 grams 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.460
 then minced a large private 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.880
 petty with two to three toes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.630
 garlic then half a spoon 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.630
 tomato paste and a half for paprika 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.720
 then your birthday needs salt pepper 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:38.990
 and paprika and dried peoples with 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.860
 I have fried many olive oil and 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.800
 Finally the sun is shining 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:02:02.119
 my clique i have constantly when you are 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:02:05.600
 I would not look at me 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.319
 work a tablespoon of tomato paste and 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.979
 half a tablespoon of paprika and the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.979
 laws 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:38.710
 whole two questions to his many liters 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 water it and make the whole because so 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:48.940
 in front of him, my horse is simmering like 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.970
 you see , she's liquid sitting us 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.220
 there is still going on and on 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.370
 That's how it has to be 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.500
 I dried my eggplants 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.990
 that is very important otherwise nothing 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:12.970
 place and evaluate the oil during the process 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:17.530
 This will be your good chance now 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.460
 he I'll give you two variations 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.560
 demonstrate 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.620
 I have found little ones now 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.320
 Baking dish for each person 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.890
 I'll have three or four first 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:35.760
 Slices or held and then by 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.760
 just give it to my production 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.620
 we can top up the course 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.690
 now only because I give them and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.560
 but I'll fill that up again 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.410
 do not do it now 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.410
 and here is then cheese on it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.370
 so the customers now at 200 degrees about 15 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.650
 until 20 minutes in the shot the second 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.190
 Variation is I have my eggplants 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:08.790
 stayed on a casserole dish and gave 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:11.280
 then my meatloaf about it and now 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:20.510
 the cabin keys with a few slices 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:24.420
 tomato or paprika whatever you want 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.770
 and give them then also 15 to 20 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.530
 minutes in the oven 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.630
 So we both eat very much 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.450
 like and both tastes delicious 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.060
 you just come and try it 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.130
 as a matter of small issues I have 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.040
 already come out of the oven 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.400
 looks really delicious and looks like that 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.530
 pure lusaka in casserole from here 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.840
 comes to either make white or 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.790
 Noodles I hope you have fun exactly 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.590
