00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 with the four processors or the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.790
 processors that you have or with 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 only with one that starts a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.470
 a little bit quicker than it really serves 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.480
 much 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.910
 what does it serve us for so that as 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.080
 I repeat to start a little more 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.080
 fast through 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.770

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.880
 how are we going to do this only 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.360
 we hear the home key more ere and that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.790
 we write more complete 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.790
 ok we give here to accept 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.750
 and here we have what appears 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 little eyelash here we do not see anything 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's go where it starts 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.500
 we select here where it says options 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.970
 advanced here choose the number of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.479
 teachers that you have can 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.540
 have 1 2 3 4 5 6 the ones that you have 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.479
 they choose the maximum if they are 44 then yes 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.479
 There are 6 are 6 are given to accept 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.350
 then we go here to what is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.390
 start windows start windows 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.060
 is with what programs will it start 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.220
 what is the operating system I 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.400
 I recommend that you remove those that do not 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.190
 they use in this case I do not use what 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.980
 what is the sony sport the itunes the 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.450
 facebook that the app these programs are 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.700
 we take them off or you want 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'm just recommending you not to 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.740
 remove none of those that are from intel 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.750
 of adobe audio intel and 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.080
 controllers all other programs 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.180
 that run like this the skype will 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.760
 remove so it does not start with the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.560
 system and take a long time to start a 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.800
 once having all this only what 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.340
 what we are going to do is apply 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.630
 accept and they will ask for a restart 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.420
 then the restart in this case does not 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.530
 because then 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.840
 I already did it and it helped me a lot 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.310
 and then that would be all friends I hope they 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 you liked my video if you liked it 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.330

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.330
