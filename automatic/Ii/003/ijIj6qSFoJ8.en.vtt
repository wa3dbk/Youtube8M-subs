00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
but because you know skid you're so used

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.460 
but because you know skid you're so used
to<00:02:38.670> Sebastian<00:02:39.120> Bach<00:02:39.299> which<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.079> like<00:02:40.230> love

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470

to Sebastian Bach which is like love
with<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.370> combination<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:42.269> said<00:02:43.079> before<00:02:43.200> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
with that combination I said before that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.289 
with that combination I said before that
I<00:02:43.860> thought<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.400> covers<00:02:44.670> Nichelle<00:02:44.910> off<00:02:45.090> with

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
I thought this covers Nichelle off with

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.800 
I thought this covers Nichelle off with
them<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:47.069> just<00:02:47.310> don't<00:02:47.519> work<00:02:47.810> perfectly

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
them then they just don't work perfectly

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.170 
them then they just don't work perfectly
together<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.440> consider<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.700> skid<00:02:50.970> row

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
together I consider this the skid row

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.300 
together I consider this the skid row
without<00:02:51.750> Sebastian<00:02:52.170> Bach<00:02:52.530> works<00:02:52.829> better<00:02:53.099> than

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
without Sebastian Bach works better than

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430 
without Sebastian Bach works better than
Sebastian<00:02:53.549> Bach<00:02:53.879> sola<00:02:54.379> even<00:02:55.379> though

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
