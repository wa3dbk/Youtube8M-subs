 Jakhrani Hello dear ones today I have a small block friendly there 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.940
 have titles as he has already seen the shine recognize 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.410
 came he is such an association to go with the nail polish of fast with 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.009
 I honestly said everything else 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.739
 never so busy APA 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.739
 I think the nail polishes of Jan Bielicki 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.349
 He always sweats a seat at the Heidenheim 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.660
 and I think that's really interesting 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 how did you do that? 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.949
 that is so 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.559
 Such a marketing technique, it can simply be a really very good one 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.680
 flair 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 what do we separate per night just make the trend so 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.240
 the first time where i am in front 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.480
 already heard a nail polish enough that was at the 5 0 5 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 he had told in the pan and then percent 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.360
 was almost 8 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.960
 for me you saw killed for it but somehow something similar m 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.720
 To this top I could just have a very amusing post 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.480
 link the showdown trend color wore 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 Just take a look you'll pay percentages 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 So there I have the first time from Michaela Koller 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.920
 and from Tina Wewer 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 So you know that I have to do not only have to have to do 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 then something looked different 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.440
 those want to go out 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.200
 who paradoxical valley 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.690
 a bit of sense is also still young and but the situation without a driver so 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.440
 insofar a color 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.470
 b who I bought new now is the way Cologne 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 I first thought that I do not give 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 need 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.480
 because like the Grim Reaper it is 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.930
 5 Weiger 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.660
 BayernLB has asked Murray and asks media 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.980
 hpd presented and around 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.180
 But then it was in the evening so no daylight and I have them 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.730
 asked if they still just put it back so I'll go with it 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.929
 White light can try 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.049
 as the buyer but also Cuba 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.609
 without Taddei directly next to the grim reaper and has the am 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.619
 next day the cookbook currently being discussed may 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.199
 where the patients do not see themselves as too similar and then 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.660
 he did not care 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.839
 No, that's a completely different question 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.239
 and that of all mine yes 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.079
 So much for this were a few customers must of course strengthened and 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.679
 He also had quite a bit 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:41.169
 He left Stadtsee roles and this is Green Black, especially since I too 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.379
 Title yes, anyway, so stand and so be it 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:51.159
 Now the IHK researchers are not giving anything to the Chamber of Commerce 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.279
 such a bottle is real word for Sunday 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.139
 But I thought a little bit about that in the sense of one 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.849
 So of course, if I'm a student, that's an incredible amount of money, of course 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.519
 So if I think about what I got his pocket money has that 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.949
 Kate did not spend it anyway, I already own something 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.839
 older faction on there at the Canada Boc etc since that is not quite so 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.859
 dramatically even 22 euros cost even smooth 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.689
 but 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.319
 it's actually such a network you can understand that 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.649
 use 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:28.059
 I always go to the cinema that costs ten euros yes I have reached this I am now 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.439
 soon once orders not "super" wing successfully trained to 3 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.869
 Chic however it was just a good feeling for the St 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.159
 ansich 22 Euro drove Lothar so that is so 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.599
 is of course then in the market relatively but that would be my opinion 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 which would be totally interesting to know 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:54.919
 Now you buy this Sharm El AKEL Breuer because they failed without work 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.799
 the one way down below Brain Challenge simply farmhouse the and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.139
 to make tasty 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.549
 that would interest me now so he writes that in the comments 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.029
 I'm looking forward to a really very lively discussion 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:08.950
 the senses 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.700
 I'm curious about your opinion on the appearance of a phenomenon until then Euro pro 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.879
 cow
