an intermediary between the spirits and

village or community I should imagine
very<00:01:06.150> much<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> spiritual<00:01:07.200> plumber<00:01:07.700> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
very much like a spiritual plumber you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
very much like a spiritual plumber you
know<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.119> people<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> group<00:01:10.140> would<00:01:10.350> have

know that people in the group would have

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
know that people in the group would have
had<00:01:10.680> their<00:01:10.890> own<00:01:10.920> roles<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.640> person<00:01:12.030> who<00:01:12.150> was

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
had their own roles the person who was

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
had their own roles the person who was
best<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.720> hunting<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.439> been<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> hunter

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
best at hunting would have been a hunter

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
best at hunting would have been a hunter
the<00:01:14.820> person<00:01:15.210> who<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.509> best<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.900> talking<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the person who was best at talking to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.969 
the person who was best at talking to
the<00:01:16.530> spirits<00:01:16.920> perhaps<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.180> he<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.740> she

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the spirits perhaps because he or she

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.179 
the spirits perhaps because he or she
was<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> bit<00:01:20.460> pricey<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.960> detached<00:01:22.439> from<00:01:22.890> nor
