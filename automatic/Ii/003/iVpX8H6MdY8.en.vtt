00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.370 
Arduino and it'll be the first length of
the<00:01:09.689> library<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:10.979> easy<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.460> use<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the library it's very easy to use and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.870 
the library it's very easy to use and
yeah<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> real<00:01:13.979> joy<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> program<00:01:14.610> very

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
yeah it was a real joy to program very

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
yeah it was a real joy to program very
quick<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> easy<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.170> project<00:01:16.650> only<00:01:16.860> took

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
quick and easy this project only took

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
quick and easy this project only took
about<00:01:17.360> half<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.540> hour<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.409> wire

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
about half an hour I think just wire

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.300 
about half an hour I think just wire
everything<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> programming<00:01:22.310> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
everything up and get it programming so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
everything up and get it programming so
as<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.939> said<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.630> RF<00:01:24.869> module<00:01:25.200> here

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
as I said there is an RF module here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.060 
as I said there is an RF module here
there's<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:27.200> RF<00:01:28.200> module<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.829> drift

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
there's also an RF module on my drift

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
there's also an RF module on my drift
car<00:01:29.280> over<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:30.600> an

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
DC brushed motor which is controlled by

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.550 
DC brushed motor which is controlled by
ESC<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.720> being<00:01:55.049> easily

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
ESC and that also is being easily

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
ESC and that also is being easily
controllable<00:01:56.280> using<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> server<00:01:57.180> library<00:01:57.479> on

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
controllable using the server library on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.920 
controllable using the server library on
the<00:01:57.689> arch<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.960> always<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> will

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the arch we always well so what I will

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.709 
the arch we always well so what I will
do<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.530> grab<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> controller<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> show

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
do now is grab the controller and show

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.300 
do now is grab the controller and show
you<00:02:03.780> how<00:02:04.290> pressing<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> buttons<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you how pressing the buttons on the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.789 
you how pressing the buttons on the
controller<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:06.110> make<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> car<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.590> things

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
controller will make the car do things

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.580 
controller will make the car do things
so<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:09.030> only<00:02:09.239> using<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.750> hand<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.020> record<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so I'm only using one hand to record and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
so I'm only using one hand to record and
one<00:02:10.709> hand<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> controller<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.450> I'm

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
one hand to do the controller so I'm

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.210 
one hand to do the controller so I'm
sorry<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.260> gets<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.560> little<00:02:13.709> bit

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
sorry if this gets a little bit

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.630 
sorry if this gets a little bit
but<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:16.329> green<00:02:16.540> button<00:02:16.870> Y<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.860> used<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
but the green button Y is used to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.770 
but the green button Y is used to
accelerate<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.180> see<00:02:25.390> there<00:02:25.599> when<00:02:25.750> I

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
accelerate you can see there when I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.399 
accelerate you can see there when I
press<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.439> Y<00:02:26.709> button<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.280> car<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:28.170> car<00:02:29.170> moves

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
press the Y button the car a car moves

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.399 
press the Y button the car a car moves
Ford<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.400> red<00:02:30.760> button<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.659> used<00:02:32.049> for

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
Ford the red button a is used for

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.039 
Ford the red button a is used for
reverse<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:37.209> that's<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.599> you<00:02:37.750> got<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.930> make

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
reverse so that's right you got to make

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.300 
reverse so that's right you got to make
sure<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> button<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:38.950> actually<00:02:39.069> being

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
sure that the button is actually being

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.009 
sure that the button is actually being
pushed<00:02:39.519> down<00:02:39.579> you<00:02:39.760> can't<00:02:39.909> just<00:02:40.030> rapidly<00:02:40.450> have

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
pushed down you can't just rapidly have

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.699 
pushed down you can't just rapidly have
it<00:02:41.140> really<00:02:41.319> bad<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.109> can<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.530> works

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
it really bad so you can see that works

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.869 
it really bad so you can see that works
pretty<00:02:44.890> well<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.739> use<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.280> directional

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
pretty well and I use the directional

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.089 
pretty well and I use the directional
arrows<00:02:49.239> left<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.780> right<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.470> control<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
arrows left and right to control the

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.140 
arrows left and right to control the
steering<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.459> can<00:02:57.609> see<00:02:57.760> that's<00:02:57.970> pretty

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
steering so you can see that's pretty

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.580 
steering so you can see that's pretty
cool<00:02:58.450> as<00:02:58.599> well

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
cool as well

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.229 
cool as well
I<00:02:59.620> haven't<00:03:00.129> mounted<00:03:00.519> everything<00:03:00.879> properly

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
I haven't mounted everything properly

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.149 
I haven't mounted everything properly
onto<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.599> car<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.109> was<00:03:02.319> just<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.620> test<00:03:02.889> to

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
onto the car as this was just a test to

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.979 
onto the car as this was just a test to
see<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.549> could<00:03:03.609> get<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.970> RF<00:03:04.209> module<00:03:04.569> working

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
see if I could get the RF module working

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.110 
see if I could get the RF module working
and<00:03:05.620> they<00:03:06.310> worked<00:03:06.519> really<00:03:06.579> well<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and they worked really well and the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.929 
and they worked really well and the
sneza<00:03:07.840> library<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:08.439> the<00:03:08.709> both<00:03:09.069> for<00:03:09.790> both

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
sneza library for the both for both

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.610 
sneza library for the both for both
fitness<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.450> snez<00:03:10.720> controllers<00:03:11.170> works<00:03:11.379> very

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
fitness and snez controllers works very

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.629 
fitness and snez controllers works very
well<00:03:11.709> as<00:03:12.040> well<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:13.290> did<00:03:14.290> do<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.500> did<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.859> range<00:03:15.189> test

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
well as well I did do I did a range test

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.240 
well as well I did do I did a range test
on<00:03:15.879> these<00:03:15.970> RF<00:03:16.389> modules<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.079> I<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.769> able<00:03:17.949> to

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
on these RF modules and I was able to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.830 
on these RF modules and I was able to
get<00:03:18.609> about<00:03:19.680> 300<00:03:20.680> meters<00:03:21.090> from<00:03:22.090> being<00:03:22.329> inside

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
get about 300 meters from being inside

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.009 
get about 300 meters from being inside
to<00:03:23.319> outside<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:24.299> was<00:03:25.299> very<00:03:25.510> impressed<00:03:25.690> with

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
to outside I was very impressed with

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.900 
to outside I was very impressed with
that<00:03:26.079> range<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.650> apparently<00:03:27.160> they<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.609> go<00:03:27.760> up

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that range and apparently they can go up

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.770 
that range and apparently they can go up
to<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.120> kilometer<00:03:28.419> in<00:03:28.900> open<00:03:29.349> spaces<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.780> going

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
to a kilometer in open spaces so going

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.750 
to a kilometer in open spaces so going
from<00:03:32.049> Bluetooth<00:03:32.379> where<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.129> would<00:03:33.250> only<00:03:33.430> work

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
from Bluetooth where it would only work

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.470 
from Bluetooth where it would only work
in<00:03:33.909> my<00:03:34.030> broom<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:35.199> these<00:03:35.409> RF<00:03:35.859> modules<00:03:36.480> I'm

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
in my broom to these RF modules I'm

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.000 
in my broom to these RF modules I'm
really<00:03:37.900> impressed<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.470> I'm<00:03:38.590> definitely

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
really impressed and I'm definitely

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.000 
really impressed and I'm definitely
going<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.310> use<00:03:39.579> them<00:03:39.879> in<00:03:40.090> leet<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.560> I'm<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.739> plan

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
going to use them in leet so I'm a plan

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.670 
going to use them in leet so I'm a plan
with<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.970> setup<00:03:43.269> here<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.109> create<00:03:44.319> a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
with this setup here is to create a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.280 
with this setup here is to create a
universal<00:03:45.489> arduino<00:03:46.120> controller<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:47.049> i<00:03:47.109> can

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
universal arduino controller so i can

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.520 
universal arduino controller so i can
control<00:03:47.680> all<00:03:47.889> my<00:03:48.040> arduino<00:03:48.430> projects<00:03:48.909> I'm

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
control all my arduino projects I'm

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.189 
control all my arduino projects I'm
thinking<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:51.060> slicing<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.180> cable<00:03:52.629> back<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
thinking of slicing this cable back and

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.409 
thinking of slicing this cable back and
making<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:53.949> I<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.250> clip<00:03:54.609> it<00:03:54.760> unclip<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.180> if

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
making it so I can clip it unclip it if

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.000 
making it so I can clip it unclip it if
it<00:03:55.569> ever<00:03:55.780> needs<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.109> be<00:03:56.199> plugged<00:03:56.409> back<00:03:56.620> into<00:03:56.859> a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
it ever needs to be plugged back into a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.229 
it ever needs to be plugged back into a
snares<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.079> back<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.560> controller<00:03:59.919> I

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
project using this RF module

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.080 
project using this RF module
which<00:04:28.440> I'm<00:04:28.650> hoping<00:04:28.890> will<00:04:29.190> have<00:04:29.520> something<00:04:29.940> -

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
which I'm hoping will have something -

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.380 
which I'm hoping will have something -
where<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:30.660> over<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:32.450> with<00:04:33.450> them<00:04:34.380> I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
where is it it's over here with them I

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.320 
where is it it's over here with them I
was<00:04:36.390> actually<00:04:36.660> going<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.320> plan<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.740> use<00:04:37.980> them

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
was actually going to plan to use them

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.820 
was actually going to plan to use them
for<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:39.420> video<00:04:39.750> but<00:04:40.350> there<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> lot<00:04:40.800> of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
for this video but there was a lot of

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.060 
for this video but there was a lot of
difficulty<00:04:41.820> with<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.560> programming<00:04:43.560> side<00:04:43.860> of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
difficulty with the programming side of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.760 
difficulty with the programming side of
things<00:04:44.420> so<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:45.780> play<00:04:46.170> around<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.710> I

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
things so I just play around this and I

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.770 
things so I just play around this and I
thought<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.070> turned<00:04:47.220> out<00:04:47.280> really<00:04:47.460> well<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.910> if

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780
