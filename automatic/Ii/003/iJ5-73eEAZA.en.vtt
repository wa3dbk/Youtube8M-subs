00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.919
 demonstration of one of the town halls have with 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.400
 this ring is a hymn when you see 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.960
 there our just represented that so this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.839
 it's love it riom and that's the last 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 it's loeb knows where the string will go 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.869
 the night 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.340
 so that 's called a would like it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 simple is what hooked 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 the animate so demonstration I take 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.190
 Lyon city hall 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.340
 game with my life keeping fishing game 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 google 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.920
 that I hold with my finger and it takes 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 well there tight to be able to pass it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.130
 in the noc and still small she 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 would rather forced passage 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.860
 I know I was still too big hop 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:58.600
 it happened in it can in 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:03.119
 doubt one of the rigs a catches up the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.630
 loop to hold it with one hand 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:11.060
 hold all the rest of the line up so 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.700
 the youth is stuck 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.430
 we hold everything with one hand the net the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.689
 loop and town halls we will do some 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:28.330
 turns in it goes well in the middle a 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:33.770
 turn but this pass lose two rounds 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.420
 3 laps and 4th round 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.600
 we're going to stop there why make a 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.649
 too big pats and we have more than 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.479
 shoot the two sons the each their 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.899
 turn for so that it can go down 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.740
 towards mano and a servant for not that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:56.590
 the merlot moves there I do not know if 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.539
 we can see some afssa the ne 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.360
 find that to be sure that 8th me 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.530
 returns a bit like a fear of tiredness 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 before the loops where there is really 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.209
 very hard 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.560
 and so the one that is well hooked to the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 town hall and that should not let go and we 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.700
 will cut the surplus near the do not put 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 too close so they do not come undone 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.650
 Normally that's hip hop soul 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 so we'll put rubbish bins 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 good to check that it's okay 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.420
 hold and that's it over
