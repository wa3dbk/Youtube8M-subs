00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.970
Warning: This reaction uses irritants and corrosive chemicals.

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:11.301
This should be performed with gloves outside or in a fume hood.

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.732
Greetings fellow nerds.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.930
In this video we’re going to make fluorescein; a strongly fluorescent chemical.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:25.189
First we get 166 mg of phthalic anhydride and add to it 220 mg of resorcinol.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:28.890
Then we add on top a few drops of sulfuric acid.

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:33.041
Now we gently heat the mixture until it turns a dark red brown.

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.262
You may have to stir it around a bit to get it mixed.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:40.975
Keep heating it at around 200 degrees celsius for about 5 minutes.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.266
What’s happening is the phthalic anhydride and the resorcinol are reacting to form fluorescein.

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.970
The sulfuric acid is acting as a catalyst for this reaction.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:56.234
When it’s done turn off the heating and let it cool down to room temperature before handling it.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.204
Here we are.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.480
Add in about ten milliliters of water.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:07.267
Fluorescein isn’t very soluble in water so we also add some sodium hydroxide, about 300 mg, and shake.

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.180
Now we have a solution of fluorescein.

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:15.111
To test it we put a few drops in water under ultraviolet light.

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.061
And there it is.

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:23.715
Let’s try that again but without the background sign.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.814
You might be asking why the concentrated solution doesn’t also glow under ultraviolet light.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.365
That’s because it's so concentrated that it absorbs and quenches its own fluorescence.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.406
A diluted solution doesn’t do that.

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.879
Let’s do this one last time close up.

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:48.649
Wow, this is better than a lava lamp.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.611
And that is fluorescein.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.503
Thanks for watching.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:05.006
In this video we’re going to make cadmium selenide quantum dots, a type of nanoparticle with interesting properties.

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:13.057
In this video we’re going to demonstrate temperature sensitive fluorescence, also known as fluorescence thermochromism.
