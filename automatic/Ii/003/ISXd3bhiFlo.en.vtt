00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello guys again and I bring you a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 very expected boxing is not tom raider 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.690
 then say that it took yesterday it seems that it has 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.670
 there were programs with snacks and minutes in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 tomorrow should have arrived yesterday but 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.039
 less 3 tomorrow than version that edition 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.310
 I have not said anything 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.919
 I like auto spur I've done it already 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.019
 made to say that if I will get tom 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.219
 raider is already a bit traditional 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.109
 principles but good I always 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:29.779
 having my principles 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.689
 I'm a pretty volatile being in that 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.589
 good sense is that I have a shirt 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.640
 of ref steel what a tremendous game is 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:42.440
 terrific not bad is very bad and the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.180
 second part is fine but the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.430
 truth is that this shirt or whatever 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.750
 I like this a lot, it 's only good 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.330
 that this game has brought me the truth 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.000
 Horrible horrible you go with all illusion to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.430
 buy the wii buy zelaya thank you 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.920
 steve game disappointment that is bad 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.229
 as good xtralife extra life package 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.229
 as always my regulatory knife 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.769
 and we go live 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.009
 while the box 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.530
 because it cuts us mother 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 repeat 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 so much box for so little thing 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.500
 and here is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.630
 one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.250
 a mushroom of the super mario with the mythical 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.970
 question mark 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:06.320
 thanks xtralife a little kiss and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.830
 castlevania mirror of fate for 3ds 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:16.130
 fuck what I play here is not better and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.200
 there you have it to be backlit ay ay ay 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.840
 I think that I've waited for me like 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.020
 liked the demo as I like this saga not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.420
 he 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.490
 even though he has received criticism not 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.310
 bad but disparate especially for 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.170
 foreign media 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 the truth is that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.700
 I liked what I play, I understand 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.050
 which is another style but the truth is that 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.489
 the castlevania saga and needed 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.180
 to claim, not to say, to renew 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.180
 vindicate 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.860
 because why do I say this I tell myself this 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.260
 because after disinformation there is already 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.550
 you know that the sagas are with a 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.510
 little that that style of play 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.460
 metro and are already going to the 3d because no 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.760
 is that it was very good with those deliveries 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.320
 for the thinker of lamented fine themselves 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.670
 pulsion meats I think it was by the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.930
 second is a pretty good game on 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.310
 first sets 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.750
 and new air was needed because the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.569
 ceremony at the end it stayed like a 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.859
 own saga of portable consoles by 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.579
 example the delivery of game boy advance 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.659
 and nintendo ds and it looked like it did not come out 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.480
 there does not emit a kind of loop 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.130
 weird and from there he did not go out and I think he 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.340
 it was necessary to vindicate 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.660
 I used them I loved it I understand that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.910
 it is another gender different from the usual 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.470
 it does not have to be a plagiarism of god on 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.780
 one is simply a game that 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.480
 belongs a very specific genre and as 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.920
 said of coals on occasion is a 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 game that has its reference clear 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.960
 because in the end the genres 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.090
 they create eggs that is more than obvious 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.850
 so I consider myself a fan of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.620
 castlevania and I defend to death so much 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.390
 the forced and not because it is Spanish to 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.290
 I sweat that is Spanish kuala 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.290
 lumpur that does not matter to me 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.489
 but I think they did a great job 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.489
 good here is 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.290
 for 3ds 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.820
 and the code 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.100
 you already have 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.100
 nice box I love to talk 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.490
 and now these instructions with the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.910
 instructions 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.150
 they are shorter than usual in others 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.150
 games 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.500
 and you can quite 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.330
 You decide poster instructions with the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.540
 protagonists screenshots the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.800
 explanation of the controls is quite 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.800
 Pimp is pretty cool 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.940
 obviously clumsy paras 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.320
 summary 2 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.310
 we are amazed there you have 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.160
 and little more little wishing to play what 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.860
 more I love it is a portable console 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.590
 get in the bed and apart because 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.000
 it's cold and the television is in the background 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.590
 some interesting program that we 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.260
 it interests you to play with your 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.000
 helmets and acojonante I love that of 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.760
 the portable consoles that to be 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.950
 relaxed a comfortable position playing 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.830
 so nothing or oil I'm going to put 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.490
 a good flawed and I'll tell you that 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.800
 I thought 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.210
 corner kids a greeting and thanks to 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.060
 everyone for being here we will see 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.060
 goodbye with more goodbye
