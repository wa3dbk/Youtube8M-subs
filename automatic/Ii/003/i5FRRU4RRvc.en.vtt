00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.450
 always in this video we are going to break and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 let's exterminate another of the myths 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.070
 very large that circulate from mouth to mouth 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.519
 of gym and gym of person in 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.190
 person is already enough the great myth of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 than to lose more weight to burn more 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.930
 fat during your cardio sessions or 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.210
 exercising you should use more 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 You should wear clothing or have more sacks 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 to put on those astronaut suits 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 that they sell so that their more you can 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 use or that you have to use those 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.480
 those strips so that his is more true 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 area and enough with those myths and give them 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 to eat all the marketers and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 companies that see you in this gentlemen is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.530
 only a myth is all that is not going 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.780
 to help burn more fat is not going to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 help burn more calories 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.329
 maximum may increase the burning 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.239
 caloric at 12 percent but really 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 the only thing that does all this is that your 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.250
 again, in other words, the only thing 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 will do is you get dehydrated more than 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 lose more water which makes you think 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 that you are losing more weight but in 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 actually the only thing you're losing is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.920
 water and you're going through a very bad evil 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.440
 moment when exercising with so much 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 clothes and with so much stuff so you know 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.130
 one more myth removed please work 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.990
 to exercise in the most comfortable way that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.929
 you can so that your body can better 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.080
 breathe more and you can have a 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.720
 more comfortable training and in that way 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.920
 enjoy it and you do not hear it now for 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 people who like information 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 directly here the video is over but for 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.280
 People who like to live one of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.330
 my typical stories and why am I 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.450
 saying this let me tell you something 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.420
 I'm telling you this because this person already 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.140
 has gone through all that since my 10 in 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 my 18 years 19 years old I already all this and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.000
 As always Carlos tried all that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.270
 I went out to deal with 34 shirts 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 I jumped rope with clothes on top 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.980
 that one thing could really be 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.170
 silly and stupid by these myths up 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.930
 that I met a friend who was one 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.920
 of my was one of my 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.120
 how would we get tutor is one of my 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.079
 feet when I leave the words in 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.849
 Spanish 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:26.159
 one of my mentors was once 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.310
 may be maybe my first mentor and I 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.380
 He said 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.390
 and do not make this this really is a 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.989
 stupidity and I explain myself and I tell you that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.690
 thanks to that I had already committed the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.370
 mistake and he had made the mistake a lot 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.110
 worst I'll tell you before he 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.870
 return to Colombia and it is instructed the same and 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.760
 tell me all these things before that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.769
 us how we train together from 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.630
 the tennis academy we locked ourselves 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.610
 in the winter in 95 heat chambers 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.519
 degrees fahrenheit gone around 40 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.000
 degrees centigrade to jump rope to 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.620
 can supposedly lose more weight to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.910
 prepare for lathes and tennis 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.299
 for seasons and for 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.310
 competitions which was ridiculous 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.290
 full you realize then all 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.049
 that we already have already suffered 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.610
 we already pay the price of ignorance 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.349
 that's why I share you and tell you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.290
 really that's not worth it and it's not going 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.910
 to make any other or any great 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.150
 Unlike've seen people who messes 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.180
 to the sauna do push-ups of the chest 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.400
 puts his name to exercise 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.790
 I 've seen it in gyms and in 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.129
 clubs is a big mistake the only thing that 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.079
 helps you maybe if you're an athlete 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.409
 high competition is getting used to 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.980
 be able to breathe in higher temperatures 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.159
 but in terms of losing weight it's not going 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.950
 to help at all more than if you 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.260
 would you do in good temperatures or without 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.959
 so many clothes so that was the little 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.049
 story I hope you enjoyed the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.730
