00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.880
 postoperative swelling 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.900
 cult 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.760
 inevitably it is about 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.560
 for large lymphatic clusters 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.259
 liquids in injured tissues 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.840
 prosthetics in this case is impossible 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.300
 remove the swelling and give the cult necessary for 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.900
 prosthetics form will help to thread 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.720
 Full-time therapy will certainly be much 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.460
 easier the process of prosthetics if we 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.030
 We will work with the already prepared 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.940
 cult 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.019
 stump just it will be faster and 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.010
 less painful patient 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.620
 anti-edema therapy can be performed 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.089
 two ways 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.970
 bandaging or using special 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.280
 compression knitwear for bandaging 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.030
 a regular elastic bandage will do 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.339
 the density of the elastic bandage is very important 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.000
 on it should not be very soft but not 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.060
 must be very 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.670
 with increased compression to master the process 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.830
 bandaging is just plain important 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.830
 remember a few important details 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 it is necessary to start from the bottom of the cult 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.460
 bento coil when bandaging should 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.350
 being inside they are outside like this 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.090
 it will be wrong 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.250
 start here so a little pull up 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.030
 catch the thumb here 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:45.640
 further here it is diagonally start up 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 the bandage here is also caught by the finger 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.090
 without folds, this is all we should have 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.410
 surely now we will spread them 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.380
 compression is not at the expense of 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 bento tension but due to the amount of it 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.220
 layers while at the bottom of the cult 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.220
 there should be more than the top all on 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.180
 further this tour was 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.180
 I'm going on this tour 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.610
 here it is a tour 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.930
 below whom come down here 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.840
 you capture that's what we needed 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.000
 grab necessarily another important 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.090
 quality bandaging feature 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.170
 each subsequent round must be half 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.340
 overlap with the previous one that is 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.120
 here it is a tour of the frame I 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.470
 guided wrong and half of this 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.050
 tour up to 1 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:54.430
 here he goes half round 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:58.770
 half of this u2 tour and on 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.360
 to continue already therefore inside 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.670
 hip amputation bandaging 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.860
 I am rather difficult procedure 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.320
 for the patient himself first 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 produce it better standing which is not always 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.540
 possibly considering physiological 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.610
 particular person and secondly on 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.070
 short stump compression bandage 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.560
 elastic bandage is not so good 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.350
 keeps and will subside during the day 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.840
 so when they are amputated at the hip level 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.790
 to create compression specialists like 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.110
 rule recommend use 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.110
 compression knit
