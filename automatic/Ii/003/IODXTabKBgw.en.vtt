00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 the management of ajax will be present on Tuesday afternoon for the presentation of the 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.500
 annual figures for the financial year 2011 2012 and those figures are extraordinary 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.240
 positive for the football club it is a great was completely bald brother 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.480
 and then 100 million limit in sales goes and that it all kills 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.429
 profitability 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.050
 because turnover is nice 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.939
 the money that you receive from me must also have some and nine 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.060
 commercial of the young profit 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 that is certainly an enjoyable day of ajax that are the pillars in depth 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.800
 good luck 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.070
 It is important that we participated last year in the teams that are going 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.240
 talk that a million dollars can be made with a lot of money 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.340
 what we have seen again last year in total no less than 25 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 million 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.560
 from the champions league may have credited so that the 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.530
 blame enjoyable 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.460
 for the rest also on the transfer market how should we look carefully what happened last year 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.110
 sat was demy de zeeuw and maarten stekelenburg 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.990
 that have been transferred and then they are 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.700
 yes for some extra income we can provide 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.940
 what also falls is that the operational result that was last 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.920
 positive year too I come to school he said above 13 million positive 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.810
 how is that the explain and the cover that it came about 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.050
 he might be the color 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.720
 best news of the day because after surgery to the state shows that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 and then samang is therefore work income and expenses of the daily course of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.680
 Affairs 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.540
 and if that's so suitable 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.160
 much of mine also goes down to 13 million indeed 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.100
 and then that is an improvement that law full of confidence and help 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.799
 the matter is in order here and that of course has to do with higher costs 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.930
 controlled 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.590
 the income can always be put on a higher plan and the first one you can join 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.760
 cost makes the card set the player salaries 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 well that have 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.010
 a decline in being known last year 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.420
 Well-paid players left Ajax again and yes youth has the future 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.570
 So self-educated players with a lower salary come for a place that is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.480
 something we naturally influenced the cost structure 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.830
 In addition, it will be better than expected in the area of ​​tax matters 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.479
 to hold 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.529
 there is a strike from there falls so leaves it too so that would just be elements that 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 had a positive impact on the operating result 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.499
 are the points in the figures have not been made public we say 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.139
 as an impossible bit too much money 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.959
 yes very unfortunate is the crisis levy that nevertheless come in 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.699
 had a significant impact, two million have processed no less than the trend lock 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:32.720
 texts 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.459
 taxation that 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.810
 imposed by the government that has an is an effect 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.659
 and we have by leaving players as it looks nothing in android 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.529
 which is still a nice one in which the book about him 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.359
 we have to write off a total of over 3 million but already 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.189
 all in all, the figures are really good and therefore ajax is on the way to the so-called 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.220
 take off the champions league jacket 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.800
 and that income from the champion ball occurs as pure profit we can 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.560
 consider 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.560
 well there we are a sure solid front and back 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.619
 it indicated that 50 million and the baby could be earned 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.409
 That is gross transfer then there must of course be all the costs that you incur 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.459
 to take part in that tournament 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.530
 well and 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.809
 we have your registration good nine commercial of million 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.079
 Then you see that a large part of the extra earnings from the IMF swallow 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.579
 as a result, if you are allowed to continue, you may end up with that 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.939
 is of course not what attracts attention and violence 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.690
 the story about it 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 what happens when the imf league plays what shapes its superiority 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.029
 expected next year are therefore positive again 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.569
 Daniel pronounced normally considering that there was also no player 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.239
 that this season 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.400
 and that we were a number of transfer-free on the transfer market last summer 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.419
 but that the new year fall like 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.049
 jan vertonghen anita gregory van der wiel 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.180
 And then the foundation has been laid to the assumption that we will continue next year 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.750
 both operational and net 9 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.979
 below the line 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.439
 and there is no proper reaming
