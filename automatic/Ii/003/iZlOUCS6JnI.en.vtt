00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so we go so you get an instruction

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.490 
so we go so you get an instruction

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
pamphlet and we get a case for the SD
card<00:02:20.120> or<00:02:21.120> should<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> say<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> SD<00:02:21.959> flashcard<00:02:22.560> no

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.500 
card or should I say the SD flashcard no
I'm<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.730> gonna<00:02:23.880> pop<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.420> open<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:27.270> that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I'm just gonna pop this open and that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.080 
I'm just gonna pop this open and that's
what<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.020> now<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> side<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.610> SD

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
what it is now on the side of this SD

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.280 
what it is now on the side of this SD
card<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:31.440> also<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> security<00:02:32.840> clip<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
card you also have a security clip so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.559 
card you also have a security clip so
you<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.530> turn<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.160> push<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> up<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.330> down

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
you can turn you can push it up or down

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.710 
you can turn you can push it up or down
so<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:38.010> obviously<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.819> do<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.600> your

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
so up it's obviously you can do all your

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.490 
so up it's obviously you can do all your
data<00:02:40.020> transfers<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.450> videos<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.810> copy

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
data transfers and videos you can copy

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.040 
data transfers and videos you can copy
right<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.489> everything<00:02:44.910> onto<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.720> SD

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
right to it and everything onto this SD

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.620 
right to it and everything onto this SD
card<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.700> close<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:47.970> down<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
card and then you can close it down and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.040 
card and then you can close it down and
then<00:02:49.050> no<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.950> could<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.810> write<00:02:51.810> anything

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
then no one could really write anything

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900 
then no one could really write anything
on<00:02:52.290> there<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.100> still<00:02:53.280> has<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.459> sort

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
on there so it still has that sort

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.850 
on there so it still has that sort
function<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.380> basically<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
function on there so it basically is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.949 
function on there so it basically is
than<00:02:56.100> an<00:02:56.190> SD<00:02:56.519> card<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> has<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.780> Y

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
than an SD card it all it has is just Y

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.550 
than an SD card it all it has is just Y
flat<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.890> when<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.160> connect<00:02:59.550> it<00:03:00.230> into<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.380> Wi-Fi

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
flat so when you connect it into a Wi-Fi

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.710 
flat so when you connect it into a Wi-Fi
device<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.610> will<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> instructions

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
device it will have all the instructions

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.420 
device it will have all the instructions
that<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.959> normally<00:03:04.080> have<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.980> connect<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that you normally have to connect to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.290 
that you normally have to connect to
Wi-Fi<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.500> my<00:03:07.709> review<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.700> C<00:03:09.060> bar

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
Wi-Fi so that's my review on the C bar

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.840 
Wi-Fi so that's my review on the C bar
