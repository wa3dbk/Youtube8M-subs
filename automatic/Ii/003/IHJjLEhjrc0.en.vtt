00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
bit today because we took a little

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.660 
bit today because we took a little
longer<00:00:31.869> than<00:00:32.019> we<00:00:32.169> thought<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.649> prepare<00:00:33.070> some

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
longer than we thought to prepare some

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.830 
longer than we thought to prepare some
of<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.880> action<00:00:34.270> which<00:00:34.450> is<00:00:34.630> little

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
of the action which is little

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.930 
of the action which is little
complicated<00:00:35.200> but<00:00:35.860> we<00:00:35.980> shot<00:00:36.219> about<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.520> hundred

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
complicated but we shot about a hundred

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.560 
complicated but we shot about a hundred
and<00:00:37.000> thirty<00:00:37.180> days<00:00:37.719> which<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:38.829> not<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.329> long

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
and thirty days which is not so long

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.229 
and thirty days which is not so long
actually<00:00:40.780> for<00:00:41.140> an<00:00:41.230> action<00:00:41.500> film<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:42.640> haven't

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
actually for an action film it haven't

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.750 
actually for an action film it haven't
stopped<00:00:43.719> so<00:00:44.170> many<00:00:44.200> times<00:00:44.590> I<00:00:44.710> mean<00:00:44.829> not<00:00:45.280> really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
stopped so many times I mean not really

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.670 
stopped so many times I mean not really
there<00:00:46.059> was<00:00:46.149> just<00:00:46.180> one<00:00:46.480> gap<00:00:46.899> we<00:00:47.110> started<00:00:47.469> we<00:00:47.559> had

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
there was just one gap we started we had

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.040 
there was just one gap we started we had
some<00:00:47.829> complications<00:00:48.129> with<00:00:48.520> dates<00:00:48.879> also<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:49.930> we

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
some complications with dates also so we

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.869 
some complications with dates also so we
started<00:00:50.410> shooting<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.920> then<00:00:51.100> realized<00:00:51.730> that

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
started shooting and then realized that

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.630 
started shooting and then realized that
maybe<00:00:52.510> we<00:00:52.719> should<00:00:52.930> wait<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.739> little<00:00:54.010> longer<00:00:54.190> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
maybe we should wait a little longer and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.520 
maybe we should wait a little longer and
just<00:00:54.730> plan<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.750> rest<00:00:55.899> of<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.230> action

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
just plan the rest of the action

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.860 
just plan the rest of the action
sequences<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:57.070> bit<00:00:57.309> better<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:57.910> these<00:00:58.600> are<00:00:58.750> just

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
sequences a bit better so these are just

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.319 
sequences a bit better so these are just
boring<00:00:59.440> production<00:00:59.920> things<00:01:00.129> in<00:01:00.309> yeah<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.239> is

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
boring production things in yeah this is

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
that it is a copy of a Bond film but

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.140 
that it is a copy of a Bond film but
it's<00:01:22.540> not<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.470> bollywood<00:01:23.979> time<00:01:24.369> yeah<00:01:24.939> but

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's not in a bollywood time yeah but
that<00:01:25.299> would<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> mistake<00:01:25.840> because<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.710> know

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that would be a mistake because you know

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
special and their budgets also so

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.760 
special and their budgets also so
different<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:31.810> they<00:01:31.990> can<00:01:32.140> do<00:01:32.259> justice<00:01:32.740> to

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
character it doesn't show so much what

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.520

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
she doesn't like it but she's remarkably

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.479 
she doesn't like it but she's remarkably
good<00:04:01.090> at<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.500> she's<00:04:02.500> got<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.709> very<00:04:02.829> intense<00:04:03.190> kind

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
good at it she's got a very intense kind

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.610 
good at it she's got a very intense kind
of<00:04:03.609> expression<00:04:04.120> or<00:04:04.239> so<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:05.019> think<00:04:05.350> this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
of expression or so and so I think this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.229 
of expression or so and so I think this
role<00:04:05.799> suits<00:04:06.100> are<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> lot<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.790> good<00:04:06.970> part

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
role suits are a lot it's a good part

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.110 
role suits are a lot it's a good part
and<00:04:07.450> then<00:04:07.870> she's<00:04:08.230> great<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.830> we're<00:04:09.819> lucky

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
and then she's great in it we're lucky

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.570 
and then she's great in it we're lucky
of<00:04:11.019> course<00:04:11.080> but<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.560> think<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:12.250> she's<00:04:12.549> more

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
of course but I think that she's more

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.210 
of course but I think that she's more
into<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.569> dancing<00:04:14.200> part<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.709> film<00:04:14.950> and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
into the dancing part of the film and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.789 
into the dancing part of the film and
the<00:04:15.340> same<00:04:15.549> I'm<00:04:15.790> sure<00:04:15.819> I'm<00:04:16.690> sure<00:04:16.750> but<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.409> can't

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
the same I'm sure I'm sure but you can't

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.560 
the same I'm sure I'm sure but you can't
tell<00:04:18.039> which<00:04:18.250> part<00:04:18.519> she's<00:04:18.760> into<00:04:19.090> more<00:04:19.299> than<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
tell which part she's into more than the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.479 
tell which part she's into more than the
others<00:04:19.810> when<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.049> see<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.349> film<00:04:20.530> but<00:04:21.130> inside

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
others when you see the film but inside

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.180 
others when you see the film but inside
I<00:04:21.519> think<00:04:21.940> she<00:04:22.900> does<00:04:23.080> prefer<00:04:23.409> the<00:04:23.560> dancing<00:04:23.919> them

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
I think she does prefer the dancing them

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.880 
I think she does prefer the dancing them
I<00:04:24.310> love<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.849> mood<00:04:25.419> restaurant<00:04:26.050> she<00:04:26.770> has<00:04:26.860> a
