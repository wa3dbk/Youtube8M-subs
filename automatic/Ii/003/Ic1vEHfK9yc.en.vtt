00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.540
 the pink panther and i play black 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.440
 ops 2 softcore team deathmatch on the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 map newtown as you can see 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 yes and the game is not even like that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.150
 bad run I'm like that 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 really surprised and that has 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.050
 mostly the advantage that you have the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.449
 shoot down people lying down easily 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 can and can surprise her 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.530
 yes, but it is not my topic today 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 but grow up become puberty 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 family that there was such a thing 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.640
 a little bit but that is a topic where 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 I like to talk to you about it 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.480
 For one thing, my nephews have me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.420
 posted the micro and the angelo 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 and they are often asked if I am 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 really am her uncle and so on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.170
 So they do not believe that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.629
 so first nice greetings to mine 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 both nephews are actually 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.590
 my nephews and the other yes my 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.189
 Son man is also just in the age 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.320
 So where does one actually grow up? 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes a bit more in the direction 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 But adults should be grown up 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 just given to parents and parents 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.000
 children or adolescents always 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 fundamentally different opinions are because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.520
 We should also go our own way 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.320
 go and that's right and so 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.110
 that's why it separates like that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 bit but i just want to too 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 Let's call that the parents once 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.020
 little bit more understanding for the boys 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.270
 people rather remaining and just times 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.840
 try to understand what they are 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770
 just going on in their world and those 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.619
 just a bit 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.100
 free space and let free rein 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.159
 I find that very important but me 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.409
 I would also like to call the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.079
 Start teenagers 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.479
 but they should also understand 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.150
 the parents wanted the parents 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.310
 yes, nothing else that the kids what 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 make reasonable 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.349
 and also reasonable here or 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 make your life reasonable and 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.170
 That's why they're watching, of course 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.050
 a bit closer to what's happening there 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.370
 and that did not happen 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.830
 can understand that you to 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 for hours in front of the pc hang this 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.920
 it is logical 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.510
 yes they want you to be sensible 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370
 training and so on 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.150
 they want you to be on their own 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.220
 but is well the opinion drifting there 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.580
 very far apart there is one 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.080
 opinion i will be football star or now 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.150
 I know what and the parents see that 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.459
 just not as idiocy and want 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.330
 that the children accordingly what 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.040
 reasonable learning and there you can 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.560
 just do not be mad about it 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.650
 because they just worry about it 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.280
 After all, you want her to be right afterward 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.720
 can stand on their own feet and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.060
 Do not make any nonsense where you are 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 then in the end much time wasted 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.980
 and there's nothing wrong with that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.160
 also her a little bit of understanding and 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.019
 especially also respectful of that 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 For example, I find that very important 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.900
 and if you respect the parents 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.390
 yes loses then it is clear that there 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.829
 That's why it's the worst smear 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.620
 very important that it is always of both 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.709
 somehow it works that way 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.880
 both respect each other also 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.859
 what one does in each case so and then 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.569
 someone wrote me about because of him 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.400
 would be bullied because of year 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.549
 both have pimples and such stories 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.840
 acne simple and that's what i find 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.190
 just totally bad 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.069
 yes, because that is part of growing up 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.489
 In addition the body reacts stop 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.130
 accordingly not as you would 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.010
 would like to have and pass it quite a lot 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.260
 weird things and that's why 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.769
 then being bullied I really think 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.770
 next to it, people respect you 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.260
 each other yes 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.220
 that is how life can be so much 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.959
 be more beautiful 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.700
 instead of getting each other 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.860
 always somehow yes mod or otherwise 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.820
 something that is logical that one 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.480
 then feels uncomfortable because of it 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.570
 please try it and go with yours 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.970
 compared to just fair to the best 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.850
 as you yourself is for you like 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.640
 if you did not run then you do not run 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.980
 just to hurt somebody else there 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.170
 what you do not heal for yourself either 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.430
 you want and that's what most people 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.770
 just forget 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.420
 they make fun of it and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.670
 Just make the other one down 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.190
 so that they feel better 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.990
 because she is probably very angry herself 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.060
 problems have somehow with yourself 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.580
 straight and that's why you just have to 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.800
 others are killed with it 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.610
 you feel better and you do not know if 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.280
 that must be 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.010
 so think about it before if 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.390
 you somehow put somebody in the pan 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.940
 want to punch or something 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.850
 because you want that for yourself 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.410
 probably not at all and me 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.670
 always say as beautiful as you in the forest 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.870
 It shouts out 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.070
 but now at the end of the 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.180
 Gameplay and I think that was it 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.810
 not so bad so I have 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:45.090
 really fun 35 9 almost 4 ak d 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.090
 Well, many thanks for watching 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:54.549
 gaming which come from the band- 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:08.280
 or search and hide if 43 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:13.100
 a little too much and are like pink 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.100
 panther says pink panther fr
