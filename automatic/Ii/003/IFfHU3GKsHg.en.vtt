00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
let's trick to actually let me check the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360 
let's trick to actually let me check the
quality<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.380> only<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.950> skins

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
quality of that so not only do get skins

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
quality of that so not only do get skins
but<00:02:38.700> then<00:02:38.880> they're<00:02:39.000> also<00:02:39.410> they<00:02:40.410> all<00:02:40.530> have

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
but then they're also they all have

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.320 
but then they're also they all have
different<00:02:40.680> qualities<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.760> either<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.150> been

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
different qualities so either it's been

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.850 
different qualities so either it's been
out<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> battlefield<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> long<00:02:43.560> time<00:02:43.830> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
out the battlefield for a long time that
