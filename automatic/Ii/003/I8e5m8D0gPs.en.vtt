in<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.980> turn<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.279> turn<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> screw<00:00:18.180> but

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
in there and turn it turn the screw but

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
in there and turn it turn the screw but
wrapped<00:00:19.289> around<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.980> screw<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.520> these

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
wrapped around the screw are these

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.320 
wrapped around the screw are these
threads<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.100> these<00:00:23.100> threads<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.820> really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
threads and these threads are really

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.689 
threads and these threads are really
like<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:24.840> incline<00:00:25.529> that's<00:00:26.099> wrapped<00:00:26.490> around

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
like an incline that's wrapped around

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
like an incline that's wrapped around
the<00:00:27.420> screw<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.710> pieces<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the screw and if you have two pieces of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.120 
the screw and if you have two pieces of
wood<00:00:31.160> say<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.410> you<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> screw

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
wood say like this and you put the screw

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.650 
wood say like this and you put the screw
into<00:00:35.399> them<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> screw<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.590> tight

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
into them then as you screw it in tight

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
into them then as you screw it in tight
the<00:00:39.660> screws<00:00:39.960> cutting<00:00:40.320> through<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> wood<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the screws cutting through the wood the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540 
the screws cutting through the wood the
head<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> screw<00:00:42.200> catches<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.950> piece<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
head of the screw catches this piece of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
head of the screw catches this piece of
wood<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> pulls<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.260> tight<00:00:46.559> against

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
wood here and pulls it up tight against

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.010 
wood here and pulls it up tight against
the<00:00:47.250> other<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.420> fasten<00:00:48.870> two

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the other one so you can fasten two

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
the other one so you can fasten two
pieces<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> wood<00:00:49.620> together<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> screw

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pieces of wood together with the screw

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.299 
pieces of wood together with the screw
the<00:00:51.239> force<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> exert<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.770> turn<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the force that you exert to turn on the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.450 
the force that you exert to turn on the
screw<00:00:53.610> gets<00:00:54.210> multiplied<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.649> angle<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
screw gets multiplied by the angle of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
screw gets multiplied by the angle of
the<00:00:56.610> threads<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.870> those<00:00:58.020> threads<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.680> an

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the threads think of those threads as an

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660 
the threads think of those threads as an
incline<00:00:59.640> wrapped<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.350> screw<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
incline wrapped around the screw and you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
incline wrapped around the screw and you
can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> trade-off<00:01:03.660> between<00:01:03.690> force<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
can see the trade-off between force and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
can see the trade-off between force and
distance<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> realize<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
distance if you realize that you have to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
distance if you realize that you have to
turn<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.470> screw<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> turn<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
turn the screw a lot you have to turn it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.120 
turn the screw a lot you have to turn it
around<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.380> several

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
around and around and around several

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
around and around and around several
times<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> screw<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.140> advance

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
times just to get the screw to advance

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
times just to get the screw to advance
maybe<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.310> inch<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> fraction<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.540> inch

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
maybe an inch or a fraction of an inch

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.499 
maybe an inch or a fraction of an inch
so<00:01:16.470> there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> lot<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.159> turning<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so there's a lot of turning going in to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.140 
so there's a lot of turning going in to
get<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.500> small<00:01:19.650> motion<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
get out a very small motion and that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.149 
get out a very small motion and that
gives<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.689> screw<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> large<00:01:22.439> mechanical

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
gives the screw a large mechanical

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
gives the screw a large mechanical
advantage<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.880> screws<00:01:24.600> also<00:01:24.979> designed

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
advantage a screws also designed

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
advantage a screws also designed
intentionally<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> friction

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
intentionally to have a lot of friction

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
intentionally to have a lot of friction
it's<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.579> efficient<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> good

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's not very efficient there's a good

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's not very efficient there's a good
bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.079> energy<00:01:31.320> lost<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.860> friction<00:01:32.130> because

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
bit of energy lost to friction because

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.330 
bit of energy lost to friction because
you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> screw<00:01:33.299> coming<00:01:33.720> loose

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
you don't want the screw coming loose

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
you don't want the screw coming loose
but<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> does<00:01:35.909> multiply<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> force

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
but it does multiply the force

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
but it does multiply the force
considerably<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> picture<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> what's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
considerably this is a picture of what's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.389 
considerably this is a picture of what's
called<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.540> screw<00:01:42.899> jack<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.439> sometimes<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.100> jack

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
called a screw jack or sometimes a jack

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
called a screw jack or sometimes a jack
screw<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> threads<00:01:46.229> down

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
screw and you don't see the threads down

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
screw and you don't see the threads down
in<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.009> they're<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.340> inside<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
in here but they're down inside this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.770 
in here but they're down inside this
metal<00:01:49.140> pole<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.159> runs<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.210> inside

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
metal pole right there runs down inside

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.910 
metal pole right there runs down inside
and<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.590> threaded<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.729> inside<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
and it's threaded down inside here and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.740 
and it's threaded down inside here and
so<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.399> take<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.850> top<00:01:57.180> part<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so you could take this top part and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200 
so you could take this top part and
twist<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.439> start<00:01:59.009> unscrewing<00:01:59.490> it<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
twist it and start unscrewing it and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.380 
twist it and start unscrewing it and
this<00:02:00.329> top<00:02:00.570> part<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.110> rise<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:02.210> another<00:02:03.210> way

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this top part would rise up another way

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
this top part would rise up another way
to<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> top<00:02:04.320> part<00:02:04.729> rotates

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to think of it is this top part rotates

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.260 
to think of it is this top part rotates
and<00:02:06.000> screws<00:02:06.360> down<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.220> base<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and screws down into the base here this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
and screws down into the base here this
thing<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> foot<00:02:10.050> tall<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.739> see

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
thing is about a foot tall you can see

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440 
thing is about a foot tall you can see
this<00:02:11.129> part<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.790> handle<00:02:12.300> just

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
this part right here is a handle just

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.160 
this part right here is a handle just
for<00:02:12.720> holding

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
for holding

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
for holding
so<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.830> gives<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.130> an<00:02:14.220> idea<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.550> how<00:02:14.670> big<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so that gives you an idea of how big it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
so that gives you an idea of how big it
is<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.660> usually<00:02:15.990> very<00:02:16.319> sturdy<00:02:16.680> made<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.160> steel

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
is is usually very sturdy made of steel

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.059 
is is usually very sturdy made of steel
and<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.330> hole<00:02:18.599> right<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.830> stick<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and this hole right here you can stick a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.370 
and this hole right here you can stick a
pipe<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.610> there<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> metal<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.900> metal<00:02:21.930> object

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
pipe in there or a metal a metal object

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.280 
pipe in there or a metal a metal object
suppose<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.069> stuck<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> long<00:02:23.910> metal<00:02:24.540> pipe<00:02:25.020> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
suppose you stuck a long metal pipe in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.010 
suppose you stuck a long metal pipe in
here<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.989> then<00:02:27.989> instead<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.560> unscrewing<00:02:29.520> this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
here and then instead of unscrewing this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.410 
here and then instead of unscrewing this
you<00:02:31.020> start<00:02:31.380> putting<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.100> force<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.880> end<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
you start putting a force on the end of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.210 
you start putting a force on the end of
this<00:02:33.569> pipe<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.470> you're<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> force

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
this pipe so it's you're going to force

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.090 
this pipe so it's you're going to force
it<00:02:35.370> around<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.600> way<00:02:36.840> you're<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.890> be

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it around this way you're going to be

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.970 
it around this way you're going to be
rotating<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.480> unscrew<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.769> can

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
rotating that to unscrew this you can

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.940 
rotating that to unscrew this you can
generate<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> tremendous<00:02:41.930> upward<00:02:42.930> force<00:02:43.260> you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
generate a tremendous upward force you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.160 
generate a tremendous upward force you
get<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.190> mechanical<00:02:44.760> advantage<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
get the mechanical advantage of the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.130 
get the mechanical advantage of the
screw<00:02:47.010> due<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> angle<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> threads

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
screw due to the angle of the threads

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.830 
screw due to the angle of the threads
and<00:02:49.410> then<00:02:50.010> also<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.880> mechanical<00:02:51.030> advantage

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
and then also the mechanical advantage

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.710 
and then also the mechanical advantage
of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.140> lever<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.190> lever<00:02:53.489> arm<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> you

hundreds with a jack screw like this
this<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.819> they<00:03:02.940> use<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.269> lift<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.200> house

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
this is what they use to lift up a house

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.130 
this is what they use to lift up a house
if<00:03:05.040> they're<00:03:05.580> trying<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.030> stabilize<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.660> house

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
if they're trying to stabilize a house

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.460 
if they're trying to stabilize a house
or<00:03:07.500> actually<00:03:08.190> lift<00:03:08.790> up<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.330> house<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:10.019> put<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.350> on

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
or actually lift up a house to put it on

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530 
or actually lift up a house to put it on
something<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:11.069> move<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.360> they

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
something to move it this is how they

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.720 
something to move it this is how they
lift<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.959> they<00:03:13.170> use<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> jack<00:03:13.709> screw<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.280> these

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
lift it they use a jack screw and these

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.000 
lift it they use a jack screw and these
can<00:03:15.060> generate<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.450> tremendous<00:03:15.750> upward<00:03:16.680> force

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
can generate a tremendous upward force

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.920 
can generate a tremendous upward force
because<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.030> very<00:03:18.269> large<00:03:18.540> mechanical
