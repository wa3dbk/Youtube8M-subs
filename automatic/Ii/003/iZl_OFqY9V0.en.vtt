there is also a show progress feature
which<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.489> think<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:09.940> not<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.690> useful<00:04:11.640> it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640

a percentage both of the overall book
and<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.440> chapter<00:04:17.650> but<00:04:18.010> since<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.459> think<00:04:18.519> reading

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
and a chapter but since I think reading

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.050

should<00:04:19.180> never<00:04:19.389> be<00:04:19.539> a<00:04:19.570> chore<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:21.699> won't<00:04:21.880> have

should never be a chore you won't have

to use that very much now in the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
settings page probably the most

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.870 
settings page probably the most
important<00:04:29.740> setting<00:04:30.070> you'll<00:04:30.220> deal<00:04:30.430> with<00:04:30.460> deal

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
important setting you'll deal with deal

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.150 
important setting you'll deal with deal
with<00:04:31.090> are<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.449> font<00:04:31.660> settings<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.860> what<00:04:33.039> we're

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
with are the font settings so what we're

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.750 
with are the font settings so what we're
able<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.550> do<00:04:33.699> is<00:04:33.940> change<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.449> font<00:04:34.690> family

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
able to do is change the font family

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.920 
able to do is change the font family
let's<00:04:36.760> change<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.300> courier<00:04:38.610> font<00:04:39.610> size<00:04:39.970> why

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
let's change it to courier font size why

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.960 
let's change it to courier font size why
don't<00:04:41.139> we<00:04:41.200> turn<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.590> up<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.570> 28<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.970> font

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
don't we turn that up to 28 and font

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:55.580 
don't we turn that up to 28 and font
weight<00:04:46.740> let's<00:04:47.740> hold<00:04:48.130> our<00:04:48.460> weight<00:04:48.580> our<00:04:48.940> font<00:04:49.979> so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.700 

as<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.610> see<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> font<00:04:57.090> size<00:04:57.300> has<00:04:57.510> changed

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.990 

so<00:05:01.710> again<00:05:01.980> this<00:05:02.070> is<00:05:02.220> probably<00:05:02.640> one<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.880> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
so again this is probably one of the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.610 
so again this is probably one of the
most<00:05:03.120> important<00:05:03.720> features<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.200> an<00:05:04.320> e-reader
