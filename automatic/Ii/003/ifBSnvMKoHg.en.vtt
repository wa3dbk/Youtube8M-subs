00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.670
 how are they and I hope they are very very 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.960
 well in this event I find myself very very 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.790
 excited because we're going to record the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 club unboxing 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 If you do not know what is placed to whom 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.049
 You must have agreed where I already had you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 talked about this so we hope 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.980
 we start 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.600
 the gray color is a device in the 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.670
 which you can play through reality 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.800
 virtual what does this mean that you 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.900
 you feel inside the game and when you put yourself 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.900
 these virtual lenses to wherever you 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.190
 you multis are inside him if as well as 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.050
 the anime knows where it gets in a 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.880
 very similar device but it is a 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.890
 kind of helmet and you enter a game in 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.080
 which are trapped but in this 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.059
 you are not going to be trapped or if 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.059
 well let's start to open it 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.430
 this is the box usually the 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.430
 little boxes are a little 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 difficult to talk to us about April 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 it was the ship 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.520
 let's play music 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.799
 well that's the little box where it comes 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.290
 I am very excited to see you already 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.950
 you saw it first before me 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 cool 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.200
 wow good as everything has if your 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.600
 little bit so that in the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 way my journey and all that do not know not 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.830
 hit, let's see 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.880
 I think this is the little camera which is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
 detecting your movements in which part 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.510
 and that you're watching the game so that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.340
 can follow it the lens has also 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.980
 a cable that is connected to the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.560
 clubs rif and the camera in the camera and 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.090
 towards the light these lenses are if your 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 view is not very good you can adapt 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.150
 so that you see correctly as I 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 they thought of me here we have others more 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.140
 a lot we put here next and well already 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 appeared safe salt 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 now our close 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.690
 curd is super great 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.690
 see it 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.730
 it's like a kind of glasses eyeglasses 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.730
 of goals I do not know how they want to call 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.620
 here brings 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.090
 bring a cablecito a eliminator for a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.090
 current flowing towards light 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.849
 on this side is where they go for your head 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 here your eyes go where the lenses are 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.239
 the changes of the rhythms you can remove 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.829
 in case you need them you have some 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.260
 video game developer and you need 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.329
 cables here you can exit and in this part 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.709
 is the button to turn on what is 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.150
 very important because then what 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.540
 we connect and we see that that works 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.360
 night and it really is not on 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.990
 and our planet to clear it clear 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.810
 this goes 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.790
 to clean the lenses these and those that 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 they are inside not here that this is not 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.580
 it's useless here you can connect the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.230
 little camera and towards the light 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.730
 and these are to connect them in the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.190
 computer 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.349
 and as all 80 tried the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.530
 instructions how to use it but of course 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.530
 this 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.730
 it's okay that we'll read 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.830
 but first let's see what it brings here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.100
 has the device of the current to 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.100
 the light 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.280
 and here are more connectors for 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.920
 to be able to assemble our entire package 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.130
 demonstrate here we have things to see 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.440
 are the other little cables here come 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.450
 here they come to assemble and connect them 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.860
 Now let's see which lenses are 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.880
 those that remain for us to be able 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.020
 play super good 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.020
 and good 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.690
 Well now I'm going to connect it to 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.690
 put us to play so 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.549
