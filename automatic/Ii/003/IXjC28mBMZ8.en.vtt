00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.280
 let's make an overview of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.150
 probe 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 346 of the initials of iu means that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.220
 this probe has the possibility of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 probing with the polling system down 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
 imagine that it gives us a semi image 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.539
 photographic background before you start 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 take a look at the functions of that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.079
 probe is to say that the knobs are like 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.840
 in all the zones jaÃ©n well very 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.820
 similar has very easy use 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 we have the key to start up and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.090
 turn off we have the view key that is for 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 go to the next page or the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 next view the exit exit key that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.289
 serves to the contrary to return to the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 Previous view also serves to exit 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 of a page the menu key that we 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.980
 offers venus express venus 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.900
 express means that if we press one 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.059
 Once the options appear 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.770
 most common for the screen in the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.690
 we are now we 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.970
 we found a probing screen 2 of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.760
 It offers us to change sensitivity 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.490
 upper limit scale or smaller scale 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 speed of the letter and then with 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.020
 this command of 4 cursors we move in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 these menus and let's go for example I 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.030
 I can vary this 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.630
 now when I clack you if I get out of this 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.149
 This screen or this menu is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.409
 on this screen we see a poll are 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.539
 god where are we in mode of 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.579
 simulation in the upper part we 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.860
 indicate the depth of meters then 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.740
 the temperature in new centigrade and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 then the speed that we carry in knots 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 in the units can be changed 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.840
 on the next screen we press the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 key gave the next screen we have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.650
 the zoom screen is a zoom or 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.330
 automatic in this part in that strip 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.369
 from here we see a window that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.560
 it is always moving automatically 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 above the background and what appears 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 limits that in this window are the x 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 they are expanded and expanded to be 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.160
 see the background in detail without having 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.220
 that we change the scale of this 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.570
 scale is automatically changing 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.470
 if we press the view key again 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.060
 we went to a screen in which 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.580
 we have background 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.710
 polling all the graphics but 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.350
 superimposed on top we have a 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.540
 digital information that in this case 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.120
 We have depth and meters 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.640
 temperature of the centigrade the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.370
 knot speed the time that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.950
 We have been navigating the distance 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.240
 traveled the battery voltage and the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.570
 speed through which we have carried 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.390
 This data can be configured to 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.400
 through the menu as you will see in the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.400
 tutorial on the menu of these probes 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.900
 we press again and this is a kind of 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.230
 very particular presentation 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.590
 that imitates the ancient waves of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.580
 flashes this is used there are certain 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.440
 fishermen 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.500
 and that they use it quite especially 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.060
 to fish on ice 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.580
 both in canada in russia but it 's little 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.650
 usual in the rest of the rest 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.050
 of fishermen this screen can be 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.390
 hide by menu I'm also in the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.710
 tutorial you can see how you can 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.070
 do so that we no longer see this 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.380
 screen press again the live key and 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.550
 Here we already see the poll down 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.760
 imagine the sounding of and imaging is that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.350
 is done at a frequency of 455 that 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.450
 the cycles that is a very frequency 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.150
 high and it produces an image 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.550
 practically photographic or as if 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.200
 was an underwater ultrasound ie 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.650
 that the background looks pretty much like 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.900
 it was a three-dimensional image we are going to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.750
 press a view key and this screen is 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.030
 very interesting because it shows us in the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.520
 top survey system in 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.280
 two two-dimensional the classic and in 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.520
 the lower part the sounding in down 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.080
 imagine why it is important because 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.750
 sailors we are used to 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.370
 use the 2d survey and sometimes we go 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.989
 to consulates to interpret 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.540
 the images we see in probing 2 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.510
 but not in down imagine then the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.720
 to be able to use this double screen 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.639
 allows us to learn to interpret what 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.669
 that we were used to seeing in 2d 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.160
 to see it with the echographic sounding and 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.690
 this way we can progress much more 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.449
 quickly take advantage 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.240
 of sounding bores and therefore the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.180
 have a double screen 2 of the image 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.600
 It's very good because it was important 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.340
 this is the overview of this probe 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.979
 to turn it off as we will tighten this 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.419
 button we would keep it pressed until 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.419
 tell us that you disconnect
