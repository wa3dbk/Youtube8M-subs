anyway so it's a little flashlight that
uses<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.590> single<00:00:35.590> double<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.430> battery<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:43.210> one

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
uses a single double a battery just one

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
uses a single double a battery just one
you<00:00:44.530> can<00:00:44.710> use<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> regular<00:00:45.489> alkaline<00:00:46.390> or<00:00:46.769> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you can use a regular alkaline or a

battery<00:00:52.559> double-a<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.309> when<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:57.969> twist<00:00:58.420> it

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
battery double-a and when you twist it

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.910 
battery double-a and when you twist it
on<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.930> runs<00:01:02.800> at<00:01:03.040> about<00:01:03.239> 35<00:01:04.239> million<00:01:04.920> 35

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
on it runs at about 35 million 35

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.810 
on it runs at about 35 million 35
illumined<00:01:10.200> gave<00:01:11.200> twist<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.830> little<00:01:12.100> more<00:01:12.640> you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
illumined gave twist a little more you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.590 
illumined gave twist a little more you
get<00:01:13.140> 115<00:01:14.220> lumens<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.399> it's<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:16.210> bit<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.509> a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
get 115 lumens and it's a bit of a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.270 
get 115 lumens and it's a bit of a
difference<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:21.810> ya<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.140> we'll<00:01:23.710> switch

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
difference see ya and so we'll switch

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.000 
difference see ya and so we'll switch
there<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.619> could<00:01:26.800> have<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.520> momentary<00:01:28.390> on

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
there and you could have a momentary on

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.050 
there and you could have a momentary on
or<00:01:31.439> switched<00:01:32.439> on

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.700 

so<00:01:38.850> pretty<00:01:39.850> incredible<00:01:40.060> little<00:01:40.710> flashlight

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
so pretty incredible little flashlight

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.480 
so pretty incredible little flashlight
it's<00:01:41.979> very<00:01:42.369> bright<00:01:43.890> give<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:44.979> an<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.460> only

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
it's very bright give it an it's only

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.100 
it's very bright give it an it's only
one<00:01:46.240> double<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.990> battery<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.759> box<00:01:49.149> comes<00:01:49.960> with

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
one double a battery this box comes with

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.679

and<00:02:03.429> your<00:02:03.640> ten<00:02:03.939> large<00:02:04.659> hair<00:02:05.470> long<00:02:06.570> okay<00:02:08.880> yeah<00:02:09.880> I

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
and your ten large hair long okay yeah I

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.949 
and your ten large hair long okay yeah I
don't<00:02:10.690> already<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.350> just<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:13.660> bigger

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
don't already like it just it's bigger

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.350 
don't already like it just it's bigger
than<00:02:13.989> flash<00:02:14.410> by<00:02:14.590> itself<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> read<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
than flash by itself so I read it you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
than flash by itself so I read it you
know<00:02:16.450> no<00:02:16.660> flash<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.350> pick<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.860> land<00:02:18.100> your

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
know no flash I can pick the land your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.400 
know no flash I can pick the land your
idea<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:20.170> comes<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.440> extra<00:02:21.720> boot<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> bun

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
idea it comes with extra boot with a bun

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:35.100 
idea it comes with extra boot with a bun
and<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:24.090> washer<00:02:26.670> okay<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:33.780> workers<00:02:34.780> inside

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and a washer okay and I workers inside

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.350 
and a washer okay and I workers inside
as<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.319> step-up<00:02:37.590> dc-to-dc<00:02:38.849> converter<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.120> there

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
as a step-up dc-to-dc converter in there

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.680 
as a step-up dc-to-dc converter in there
here<00:02:40.750> inside<00:02:41.560> built<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.299> takes<00:02:43.480> out

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
here inside built in so it takes out

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.120 
here inside built in so it takes out
well<00:02:44.160> 1.5<00:02:45.160> volts<00:02:45.790> or<00:02:45.940> 1.2<00:02:46.720> volts<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.859> steps

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
well 1.5 volts or 1.2 volts and it steps

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.410 
well 1.5 volts or 1.2 volts and it steps
up<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.790> about<00:02:49.739> 3.5<00:02:50.739> or<00:02:50.769> 2.6<00:02:51.700> boats<00:02:52.090> because

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
up to about 3.5 or 2.6 boats because

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.160 
up to about 3.5 or 2.6 boats because
LEDs<00:02:55.420> added<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.959> are<00:02:56.049> no<00:02:56.170> 1.5<00:02:56.950> volt<00:02:57.220> LED<00:02:58.170> y

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
LEDs added there are no 1.5 volt LED y

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.890 
LEDs added there are no 1.5 volt LED y
le<00:02:59.380> these<00:02:59.650> why<00:02:59.950> LEDs<00:03:00.400> are<00:03:01.920> need<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:02.950> wallet<00:03:03.910> 3.53

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
le these why LEDs are need a wallet 3.53

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.610 
le these why LEDs are need a wallet 3.53
point<00:03:05.500> 6<00:03:05.769> volts<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.639> light<00:03:07.510> up<00:03:09.720> 1.2<00:03:10.720> volts<00:03:11.139> one

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.309 
point 6 volts to light up 1.2 volts one
point<00:03:11.829> three<00:03:11.859> votes<00:03:12.250> will<00:03:12.489> power<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:13.319> infrared

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
point three votes will power a infrared

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.360 
point three votes will power a infrared
LED<00:03:15.600> directly<00:03:16.600> without<00:03:16.989> stepping<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.680> whether

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
LED directly without stepping up whether

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.720 
LED directly without stepping up whether
Y<00:03:18.639> LED<00:03:19.150> requires<00:03:19.690> three<00:03:19.930> point<00:03:20.170> 6<00:03:20.380> volts<00:03:21.090> so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
Y LED requires three point 6 volts so

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:52.450 
Y LED requires three point 6 volts so
yeah

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
especially you have two little holes for

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.590 
especially you have two little holes for
the<00:03:55.320> land<00:03:55.590> yard<00:03:55.890> but<00:03:56.220> again<00:03:56.820> our<00:03:56.970> very
