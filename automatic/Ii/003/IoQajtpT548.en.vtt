because<00:02:23.379> that's<00:02:23.769> typically<00:02:24.280> one<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
because that's typically one of the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.160 
because that's typically one of the
things<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.540> have<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.690> hard<00:02:25.870> time<00:02:25.989> finding

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
concealers for myself because that they

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.790 
concealers for myself because that they
always<00:02:28.330> end<00:02:28.660> up<00:02:28.930> settling<00:02:29.200> into<00:02:29.500> my<00:02:29.620> lines

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.300 
foundation over my blush and everything
else<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.500> actually<00:03:05.709> really<00:03:06.099> impressed

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
else but I was actually really impressed

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.550 
else but I was actually really impressed
with<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:06.849> because<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.599> gives<00:03:08.260> your<00:03:08.470> skin

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
with this because it gives your skin

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.110 
with this because it gives your skin
kind<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.160> natural<00:03:09.489> glow<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.940> can

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
kind of that natural glow and you can

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.400 
kind of that natural glow and you can
definitely<00:03:10.390> still<00:03:10.930> see<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.170> through<00:03:11.319> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
definitely still see it through the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.350 
definitely still see it through the
foundation<00:03:11.829> but<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.430> not<00:03:12.549> overpowering<00:03:12.819> so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
foundation but it's not overpowering so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.069 
foundation but it's not overpowering so
I<00:03:13.390> would<00:03:13.750> definitely<00:03:14.170> give<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.099> thumbs<00:03:15.340> up

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
I would definitely give this a thumbs up

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.360 
I would definitely give this a thumbs up
the<00:03:17.079> next<00:03:17.319> step<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.769> foundation<00:03:18.250> if

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
the next step is the foundation if

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
the next step is the foundation if
you've<00:03:18.640> used<00:03:18.790> mineral<00:03:19.239> based<00:03:19.390> foundations

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
you've used mineral based foundations

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.900 
you've used mineral based foundations
before<00:03:20.410> then<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.709> know<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.950> drill<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.670> put<00:03:21.879> a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
before then you know the drill you put a

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.640 
before then you know the drill you put a
little<00:03:22.209> bit<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.540> powder<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.170> cap<00:03:23.349> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
little bit of the powder in the cap and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
little bit of the powder in the cap and
then<00:03:23.799> you<00:03:23.980> swirl<00:03:24.519> your<00:03:24.670> brush<00:03:24.730> around<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.389> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
then you swirl your brush around and you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.050 
then you swirl your brush around and you
want<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.690> tap<00:03:25.840> off<00:03:25.959> any<00:03:26.079> excess<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.250> go

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
want to tap off any excess and then go

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.670 
want to tap off any excess and then go
in<00:03:28.269> small<00:03:28.569> circular<00:03:28.810> motions<00:03:29.109> around<00:03:29.410> your

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
in small circular motions around your

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.430

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
face to apply it one thing about this

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.990 
face to apply it one thing about this
foundation<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.010> really<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:33.850> is

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
foundation that I really like is it is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.970 
foundation that I really like is it is
definitely<00:03:34.150> buildable<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.799> as

definitely buildable so you can have as

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.250 
definitely buildable so you can have as
little<00:03:36.370> or<00:03:36.579> as<00:03:36.639> much<00:03:37.180> coverage<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.079> want

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260

my<00:03:39.099> first<00:03:39.340> impression<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.030> foundation

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
my first impression of this foundation

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.750 
my first impression of this foundation
is<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.620> made<00:03:41.829> my<00:03:41.980> skin<00:03:42.040> look<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.609> little

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
is that it made my skin look a little

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.059 
is that it made my skin look a little
bit<00:03:42.940> powdery<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.510> then<00:03:43.959> as<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.650> day<00:03:44.769> went<00:03:44.980> on

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
bit powdery but then as the day went on

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.680 
bit powdery but then as the day went on
you<00:03:45.280> know<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> half<00:03:45.670> hour<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.090> an<00:03:46.120> hour<00:03:46.329> later<00:03:46.599> I

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
you know a half hour to an hour later I

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.059 
you know a half hour to an hour later I
kept<00:03:47.079> looking<00:03:47.349> in<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> mirror<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
kept looking in the mirror and I

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.159 
kept looking in the mirror and I
couldn't<00:03:48.310> believe<00:03:48.430> how<00:03:49.120> my<00:03:49.389> skin<00:03:49.690> honestly

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
couldn't believe how my skin honestly

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.589 
couldn't believe how my skin honestly
just<00:03:50.380> kind<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.739> looked<00:03:51.370> just<00:03:51.849> very<00:03:52.120> natural

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
just kind of looked just very natural

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.650 
just kind of looked just very natural
very<00:03:52.810> even<00:03:53.530> toned<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.730> not<00:03:54.910> powdery<00:03:55.299> at<00:03:55.480> all

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
very even toned and not powdery at all

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.740 
very even toned and not powdery at all
so<00:03:55.959> once<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:57.310> know<00:03:57.430> initial<00:03:57.940> hour<00:03:58.209> or

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
so once that you know initial hour or

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.659 
so once that you know initial hour or
whatever<00:03:58.989> goes<00:03:59.230> by<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.739> everything<00:04:00.310> kind<00:04:00.609> of

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
whatever goes by and everything kind of

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.129 
whatever goes by and everything kind of
just<00:04:00.730> settles<00:04:01.180> into<00:04:01.480> your<00:04:01.599> skin<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.109> just
