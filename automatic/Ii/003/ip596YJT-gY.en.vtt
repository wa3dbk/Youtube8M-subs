favor of tattoos they love them and they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
favor of tattoos they love them and they
don't<00:01:44.759> judge<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
don't judge but I think a lot of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
don't judge but I think a lot of
employers<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.130> unfortunate

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
employers do and it's unfortunate

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
employers do and it's unfortunate
because<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.540> goes<00:01:48.899> beyond<00:01:49.259> tattoos<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> feel

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because it goes beyond tattoos I feel

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
because it goes beyond tattoos I feel
like<00:01:50.399> people<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.119> judged<00:01:51.390> by<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.810> they

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like people get judged by the way they

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
like people get judged by the way they
look<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.799> dress<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.399> their<00:01:53.579> hair

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
look the way they dress what their hair

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
look the way they dress what their hair
is<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.360> opposed<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:55.079> their<00:01:55.229> skill

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
is like as opposed to what their skill

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410 
is like as opposed to what their skill
is<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:55.979> their<00:01:56.130> intellect<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.390> a

is or what their intellect is I'm not a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
is or what their intellect is I'm not a
huge<00:01:57.659> fan<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> tattoos<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> would<00:01:58.799> never

huge fan of tattoos but I would never

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.679 
huge fan of tattoos but I would never
let<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.250> stop<00:01:59.399> me<00:01:59.700> from<00:02:00.149> getting<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.509> know

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
let that stop me from getting to know

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
let that stop me from getting to know
someone<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.110> from<00:02:01.409> hiring<00:02:01.619> someone<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.460> were

couldn't get away with that but he can

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790 
couldn't get away with that but he can
so<00:05:05.389> there<00:05:05.540> is<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.690> taboo<00:05:06.080> when<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.380> comes<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.710> the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
so there is a taboo when it comes to the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.350 
so there is a taboo when it comes to the
difference<00:05:07.070> between<00:05:07.100> men<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.520> women<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.060> think

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
difference between men and women I think

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.870 
difference between men and women I think
it's<00:05:08.479> evolving<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.770> do<00:05:09.919> say<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.520> there<00:05:10.729> is

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
it's evolving but I do say that there is

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.870 
it's evolving but I do say that there is
a<00:05:10.910> branding<00:05:11.770> element<00:05:12.770> there<00:05:12.979> like<00:05:13.190> if<00:05:13.430> if

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
a branding element there like if if

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.570 
a branding element there like if if
someone<00:05:14.389> is<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:14.990> like<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.320> action<00:05:15.740> sports<00:05:16.190> or

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
someone is in like the action sports or

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.940 
someone is in like the action sports or
if<00:05:17.000> they're<00:05:17.419> in<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.630> industry<00:05:18.080> but<00:05:18.380> also<00:05:18.560> if

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
if they're in that industry but also if

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.040 
if they're in that industry but also if
someone's<00:05:19.460> doing<00:05:19.729> inspirational<00:05:20.510> things<00:05:20.780> and

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
someone's doing inspirational things and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.570 
someone's doing inspirational things and
they<00:05:21.200> have<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.410> backstory<00:05:21.710> words<00:05:22.190> like<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.370> used

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
they have a backstory words like I used

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.640 
they have a backstory words like I used
to<00:05:22.700> be<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.850> criminal<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.600> now<00:05:23.780> I'm<00:05:23.990> changing

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
to be a criminal and now I'm changing

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.320 
to be a criminal and now I'm changing
people's<00:05:25.100> lives<00:05:25.160> that<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.610> do<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:25.970> it

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
people's lives that have to do that it

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.820 
people's lives that have to do that it
fits<00:05:26.539> with<00:05:26.690> their<00:05:26.840> brand<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.200> also<00:05:27.350> think<00:05:27.650> women

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
fits with their brand I also think women

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.250 
fits with their brand I also think women
can<00:05:28.070> embrace<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.550> too<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:29.060> think<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.750> it's

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
can embrace that too I think that it's

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.190 
can embrace that too I think that it's
more<00:05:30.710> difficult<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:31.640> harder<00:05:32.030> but<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.960> think

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
more difficult it's harder but I I think

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.370 
more difficult it's harder but I I think
that<00:05:33.560> if<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:34.580> embrace<00:05:34.910> that<00:05:35.300> element<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:36.140> you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
that if you embrace that element of you

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.800 
that if you embrace that element of you
and<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:37.280> can<00:05:37.490> package<00:05:37.760> it<00:05:38.030> right<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.330> can<00:05:38.539> get

and you can package it right you can get

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.429 
and you can package it right you can get
away<00:05:38.930> with

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:40.439
