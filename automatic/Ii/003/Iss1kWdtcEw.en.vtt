of that twisted cord group of yarns is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.630 
of that twisted cord group of yarns is
going<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.340> looped<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:36.890> typically<00:02:37.890> take<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
going to be looped I typically take that

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.360 
going to be looped I typically take that
loops<00:02:39.030> bit<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.580> run<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.970> into<00:02:42.120> my<00:02:42.300> carabiner

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
grab the other end of your yarn and just

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.170 
grab the other end of your yarn and just
tie<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.640> around<00:02:53.989> your<00:02:54.989> hand<00:02:55.170> mixer<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.850> doesn't

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
ciara now step back and this is the fun

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.070 
ciara now step back and this is the fun

part turn on the blender turn it on low
and<00:03:28.080> get<00:03:28.230> started

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and get started

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.680 
and get started
now<00:03:29.849> what<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.840> go<00:03:31.349> by<00:03:31.530> feel<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:33.450> like

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
now what I do I go by feel and I like

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.110 
now what I do I go by feel and I like
the<00:03:33.870> pretty<00:03:34.260> dense<00:03:34.590> twisted<00:03:35.220> cord<00:03:35.519> pretty

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the pretty dense twisted cord pretty

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
the pretty dense twisted cord pretty
hard<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> over-tighten<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.470> actually

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
hard to over-tighten it it's actually

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.339 
hard to over-tighten it it's actually
possible<00:03:38.480> one<00:03:39.480> way<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.690> know<00:03:39.900> when<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.140> stop

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
possible one way you know when to stop

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.990 
possible one way you know when to stop
when<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> see<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.860> starting<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.370> kink<00:03:41.760> like

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
when you see it starting to kink like

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470 
when you see it starting to kink like
this<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:43.590> pretty<00:03:43.920> much<00:03:44.069> time<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.580> stop<00:03:44.880> but

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
this it's pretty much time to stop but

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.509 
this it's pretty much time to stop but
one<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.840> real<00:03:46.080> foolproof<00:03:46.590> ways<00:03:46.920> when<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
one of the real foolproof ways when you

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.970 
one of the real foolproof ways when you
know<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:47.849> time<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.299> stop<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.870> when<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> starts

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
know it's time to stop is when it starts

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.410 
know it's time to stop is when it starts
to<00:03:50.160> kink<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.549> itself<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.030> can<00:03:51.150> see<00:03:51.299> this

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
to kink on itself and you can see this

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.390 
to kink on itself and you can see this
one<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.780> kinking<00:03:52.170> pretty<00:03:52.680> hard<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.370> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
one is kinking pretty hard this is a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.130 
one is kinking pretty hard this is a
really<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.000> probably<00:03:54.420> tighter<00:03:54.690> than<00:03:54.989> you

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
really this is probably tighter than you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
really this is probably tighter than you
want<00:03:55.319> your<00:03:55.380> twisted<00:03:55.860> cord<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.190> be<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.060> I'm

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
want your twisted cord to be so I'm

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.440 
want your twisted cord to be so I'm
gonna<00:03:57.269> let<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:58.049> did<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.709> let<00:03:59.069> it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
gonna let it I just did I just let it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.220 
gonna let it I just did I just let it
unwind<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.599> little<00:04:00.630> bit

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
unwind a little bit

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.170 
unwind a little bit
but<00:04:01.560> now<00:04:01.950> let's<00:04:02.160> see<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.489> made<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.700> unwind

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
but now let's see if I made it unwind

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.650 
but now let's see if I made it unwind
too<00:04:03.420> much<00:04:03.950> pull<00:04:04.950> forward<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.000> nicely

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
too much pull forward it's so nicely

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.050 
too much pull forward it's so nicely
kinking<00:04:07.349> upon<00:04:07.620> itself<00:04:07.980> we<00:04:08.519> can<00:04:08.640> use<00:04:08.849> this

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
kinking upon itself we can use this

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.539 
kinking upon itself we can use this
twisted<00:04:09.510> cord<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:11.130> done<00:04:13.549> I'm

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
twisted cord just as it is I'm done I'm

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.740 
twisted cord just as it is I'm done I'm
gonna<00:04:14.790> take<00:04:15.209> my<00:04:16.049> hand<00:04:16.380> blender<00:04:17.389> put<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.539> down

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
gonna take my hand blender put it down

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.830 
gonna take my hand blender put it down
I'm<00:04:19.079> done<00:04:19.350> with<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.889> now<00:04:20.459> we're<00:04:20.669> going<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
I'm done with it and now we're going to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.950 
I'm done with it and now we're going to
fold<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.430> twisted<00:04:23.850> cord<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.360> half<00:04:24.539> but<00:04:24.810> it's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
fold this twisted cord in half but it's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.379 
fold this twisted cord in half but it's
really<00:04:25.350> really<00:04:25.800> important<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.970> keep

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
really really important that you keep

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.000 
really really important that you keep
the<00:04:27.600> tension<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.139> twisted<00:04:28.560> cords<00:04:28.919> you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
the tension on the twisted cords you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490 
the tension on the twisted cords you
want<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.250> completely<00:04:29.880> manage<00:04:30.360> how<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:31.289> going

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
want to completely manage how it's going

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.550 
want to completely manage how it's going
to<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.740> twisting<00:04:32.190> upon<00:04:32.460> itself<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.930> as<00:04:34.260> you<00:04:34.440> can

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
to be twisting upon itself so as you can

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.440 
to be twisting upon itself so as you can
see<00:04:34.710> here<00:04:34.950> I'm<00:04:35.100> using<00:04:35.130> one<00:04:35.639> finger<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.389> you

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
see here I'm using one finger if you

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.600 
see here I'm using one finger if you
have<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> really<00:04:37.020> really<00:04:37.050> long<00:04:37.650> twisted<00:04:38.310> cord

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
have a really really long twisted cord

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.820 
have a really really long twisted cord
you<00:04:39.210> might<00:04:39.389> need<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.660> have<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.840> friend<00:04:40.229> give<00:04:40.740> you

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you might need to have a friend give you

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.420 
you might need to have a friend give you
a<00:04:40.889> hand

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
a hand

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.469 
a hand
I<00:04:41.960> fold<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.610> keep<00:04:44.610> holding<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.120> on<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.270> other

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
I fold it keep holding it on the other

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.010 
I fold it keep holding it on the other
side<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:47.130> take<00:04:47.580> just<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.419> end<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
side and I take just the end of the
