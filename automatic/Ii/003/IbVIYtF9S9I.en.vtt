grade bands performed together we have
gotten<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.059> big<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.450> I've<00:00:12.509> been<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.750> this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
gotten so big and I've been in this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.230 
gotten so big and I've been in this
district<00:00:13.170> almost<00:00:13.410> 30<00:00:13.590> years<00:00:13.679> now<00:00:14.059> we've<00:00:15.059> got

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
district almost 30 years now we've got

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
district almost 30 years now we've got
so<00:00:15.599> big<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.379> could<00:00:16.529> no<00:00:16.680> longer<00:00:16.710> fit<00:00:17.220> on

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
so big that we could no longer fit on

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
so big that we could no longer fit on
the<00:00:17.460> stage<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.470> certainly<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> able

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the stage and certainly we would be able

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.140 
the stage and certainly we would be able
to<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.189> everybody<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:20.760> I've<00:00:21.000> talked

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to get everybody and I think I've talked

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
to get everybody and I think I've talked
to<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.390> point<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.080> we've<00:00:22.260> had<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.680> buy<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to that point so we've had to buy the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
to that point so we've had to buy the
band<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.760> been<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.119> interesting

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
band and it's been an interesting

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.970 
band and it's been an interesting
challenge<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.019> me<00:00:25.230> because<00:00:25.350> I've<00:00:25.650> never<00:00:25.830> done

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
challenge for me because I've never done

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
challenge for me because I've never done
just<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> seventh<00:00:26.939> grade<00:00:27.000> band<00:00:27.359> before<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
just to seventh grade band before so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.570 
just to seventh grade band before so
thinking<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> music<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.310> different

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
thinking the music is a little different

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.589 
thinking the music is a little different
we<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> support<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> eighth

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we don't have to support the eighth

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
we don't have to support the eighth
grade<00:00:30.810> plans<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.550> it's<00:00:32.550> been<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.759> interesting

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
grade plans and it's been an interesting

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
grade plans and it's been an interesting
challenge<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.899> I've<00:00:34.020> enjoyed<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
challenge but one I've enjoyed a lot the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
challenge but one I've enjoyed a lot the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
almost like the field points and that's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.500 
almost like the field points and that's
actually<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.500> agility
