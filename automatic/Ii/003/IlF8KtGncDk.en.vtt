 Hello everyone, this time I pointed out quickly how to clean the 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.949
 your computer internally 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.019
 OK 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.759
 after a few months of use you will write down your computer will accumulate 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 and this often compromises the proper functioning of your brand 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.779
 so first procedure is to take out that thicker dirt 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.370
 you'll get a little uncertain of an inch that kind of pressure you 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.420
 in any building material store 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.720
 and you feed yourself will pass and step on the motherboard 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.310
 about this 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.249
 finally the ukulele rises to attack 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.249
 you will do a small scan on your computer 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.290
 coincidences 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.460

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.730
 and the money tailors to resort 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.680
 this initial dirt 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.510
 why after this procedure we are going to the more specific Olympiad more 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.550

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.820

 is a special target 'of cleaning electronics 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.270
 never use the common target as this will damage your equipment 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.500
 but we take this stop and we obey a cotton swab which is not necessary 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 too much 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.300
 we passed the swab 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.750
 on the motherboard 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.740
 the one who has the songs on the goias 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.790
 about the true delefin ambassador we pass on all the fields that accumulate 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.050
 dust 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.550
 update according to procedure 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.370
 we are going to the final procedure that cleans memory but we remove or 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.030
 ivoti memory from your computer

 executives years a common rubber 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.030
 bullock follow 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.170
 Of Head 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.780
 we use to clean this metal part of the memory what of its part 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.119
 more practical river looks like metallic teeth 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.919
 we pass late rubber 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.599
 the ocde 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 we also spend the other side 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.149
 this part she usually hosts partly 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:28.279
 If you can get the sedation we pass this rubber 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.669
 then we also passed a swab with out lusa the enrico himself 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.149
 which gave more footprint and memory 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.059

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.379
 silver 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.659
