00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good this is worth we are in a new 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 video and well then we were again in 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.429
 the computer screen since today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.260
 I wanted to do another tutorial on the one 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.849
 paste sometimes all windows on 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 that people still see that it has 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.260
 many doubts and this is not that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.890
 be new 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.800
 about how to record the play3 by hdmi and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.660
 without a splitter that is something that a topic that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.700
 it's pretty easy not to say so and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.350
 Well, in this case, I record with 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.320
 good because I do not record but what he recorded 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.530
 he recorded it with the media life gamer 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 portable 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 it's good that you download it and such 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 It is interesting that the program is already 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.059
 I have open why he does not look at the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.059
 good icon 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.610
 so good then I'm going to leave 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.380
 here a little bit the video of how 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.989
 you have to place the cables and such for 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.070
 the stop give half to see everything 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.070
 an hdmi and now we go back 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 It's good because we're here and where the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 pressure with the mobile will be a quality 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.830
 potato but good the important thing is that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 you see 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.880
 and well, here we have the average view 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.350
 as you see and to record by hdmi that we 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.870
 will leave but good with what I'm going 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.450
 to say now so I 'm going to leave you 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.520
 it's a way to record by hdmi but 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.320
 well now I explain and well then 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.690
 we have to have the cable that goes from the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.810
 have average to the computer 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.970
 here plugged in then well I have 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.770
 computer and quite far because here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 I do not play the play but like to but 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.050
 for test but to record what I have 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.390
 to have here good because the cable this 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.630
 the little one we have the one on the right the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.079
 of the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.520
 as it puts here the link we have it 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.630
 have the play and the out to the TV 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.950
 sorry and then I 'm on the computer now 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.600
 more easy 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420
 well once you have the cables 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 well put then you will have to download 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.890
 the software they leave you is folder and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.300
 we open just 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 this nothing else this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 and once we open it, well, I'll take it off 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.950
 I'm a bit tired because it will not go away 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.000
 we put this in Spanish out there I do not know 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.830
 where do you look here right 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 and the first thing we have to do is 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.330
 give advanced configuration of the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.670
 right and to record the play we have 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.990
 I put it game console and a whole 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.990
 hdmi because if not 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.380
 if we put it by components not 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.750
 We will have no problem but 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.460
 if we put it on hdmi and we want to record 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.320
 directly from our program 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.780
 will give us an error because it is 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.140
 protected by a problem that had 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.420
 because people recorded movies because 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.940
 has bluray the play and recorded 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.060
 movies and they passed them to friends 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.130
 well for free not then they put this 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.880
 shit protection that to people with 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.280
 a bit of a head because it bothers us 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.750
 quite at the time of recording and good 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.810
 this one for me is the best way to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.000
 you can record this without a splitter because 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.220
 It's worth money and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.200
 well, that also bothers pretty good 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.860
 so we have to put everything in hd 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.680
 main 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.600
 well this in p4 I have it that is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.900
 the easiest and most important thing the least 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.120
 in me the 1,080 all like this all this like 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 you see hdmi and good the microphone of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.570
 I do not have a place to stop 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.570
 complicate me and good then when you have 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.070
 all this we will have you ready and 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.260
 in theory we have to be seeing 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.140
 the place and we have the cables and such good 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.580
 put and well then when you see the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.270
 play that is being seen there all right and 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.350
 as you see it from the TV the 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.990
 We try to record and as you can see 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.630
 You can because it is protected as it is 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.230
 I said and then for me the best is 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.209
 record this this window from a 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.770
 program that capture the entire screen 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.650
 of the computer for example I tried with the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.690
 sing if to record only this part but 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.720
 for white but if that goes a long way 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.720
 slow because he sings 7 was very much and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.269
 What has happened best to me? 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.210
 nothing has been with another program that stops 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.020
 I go a lot better than it is the medium and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.610
 It is action that is used by a lot of people and 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.620
 I do not have it bought 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.060
 because he did not record anything 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.560
 with special and then it's a can and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.169
 at the moment I do not plan to buy it 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.260
 but later on we'll see to see 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.330
 what's happening and well, well, this we can go 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.300
 closing since good first you 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.970
 we will have to give this 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.009
 and we can put to record all the 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.430
 screen this time yes we can put you 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.830
 to record all this or if we do not put it on 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.820
 tiny and we adjust it to the little window 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.210
 well we do not adjust it and such 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.630
 but good once we do this has 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.630
 what to leave 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.630
 here this 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.090
 and we will give you to record and such when 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.430
 everything is ready but good 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.470
 as I have already done a test because no 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.750
 I can record everything with the singing and such 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.479
 because as I said sucks a lot 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.150
 done a test before and well then it has 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.610
 come out this 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.159
 you see a hdmi completely 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.289
 I recorded it with micro and such but good 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.169
 is the barÃ§a try it and as you can see 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.879
 go totally in hd to see is not a 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.819
 good game and nothing if I go I 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.129
 stripping me but good for you to see 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.849
 that totally records hd does not go with anything 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.590
 of delay to 1080 goes perfect well this 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.699
 I get this out here because it's the demo 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.039
 but good after doing all this 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.569
 it does not come out that it's perfect that now 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.310
 from now on I can calm the 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.990
 town that asks me so much whites two 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.419
 when I want to play the play 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.180
 I do not have any wins but good 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.759
 Well, as you can see, everything is perfect 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.169
 great and you can record everything that 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.259
 you want in hdmi 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.689
 without delay or anything and without paying a 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:25.270
 big bucks with buying splitter without 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:27.810
 hdmi cables that also a section 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.090
 and because white also the because good 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.060
 well then then this the video 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.660
 we drag it good where we have it 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.660
 guarded 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.620
 the program with which we did it and if 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.290
 we do not want to edit it because we upload it 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.810
 directly from here that good 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.330
 it just keeps going the same I have not 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.740
 explained quite well alright fine but 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.210
 well done what I could and I think 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.910
 is going to help you a lot when it comes to 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.870
 record with the nightmare of the middle ader 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.090
 and htc so well then I hope that today 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.650
 is there any witch doubt that has helped you and 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.650
 see you next ciao
