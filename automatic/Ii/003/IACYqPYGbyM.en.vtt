to<00:02:32.220> come<00:02:32.460> at<00:02:32.640> him<00:02:32.880> he's<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.080> whine

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to come at him he's not going to whine

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
to come at him he's not going to whine
about<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.740> cry<00:02:35.220> about<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.720> not<00:02:36.720> gonna<00:02:36.900> point

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
about it cry about it not gonna point

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.130 
about it cry about it not gonna point
fingers<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:39.710> that's<00:02:40.710> what<00:02:41.580> he<00:02:41.730> feels<00:02:42.140> my

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
fingers but that's what he feels my

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.510 
fingers but that's what he feels my
opinion<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:46.350> know<00:02:46.500> I'm<00:02:46.830> mixed

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
opinion on it is that you know I'm mixed

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840 
opinion on it is that you know I'm mixed
I've<00:02:47.940> mixed<00:02:48.270> opinions<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:49.410> first<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.490> think

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I've mixed opinions at first I think

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.450 
I've mixed opinions at first I think
that<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.890> big<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.250> deal

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
that it's like not that big of a deal

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.420 
that it's like not that big of a deal
because<00:02:53.850> they<00:02:54.090> were<00:02:54.150> all<00:02:54.390> clean<00:02:54.810> hits<00:02:55.160> most<00:02:56.160> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
because they were all clean hits most of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.770 
because they were all clean hits most of
them<00:02:56.550> were<00:02:56.670> actually<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.690> them

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
them were actually not all of them

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.540 
them were actually not all of them
obviously<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:58.950> were<00:02:59.010> flags<00:02:59.250> on

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
obviously because there were flags on

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.820 
obviously because there were flags on
some<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.420> most<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.960> them<00:03:01.050> were<00:03:01.110> clean<00:03:01.530> hits

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
some but most of them were clean hits

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.200 
some but most of them were clean hits
and<00:03:03.860> not<00:03:04.860> just<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.310> game<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
and not just this game but on all the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.930 
and not just this game but on all the
games<00:03:06.390> they<00:03:06.510> had<00:03:06.660> bounties<00:03:07.020> for<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:08.820> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
games they had bounties for and if you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.120 
games they had bounties for and if you
have<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> pay<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> bounty<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.960> make<00:03:10.110> them<00:03:10.260> make

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
have to pay a bounty to make them make

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.580 
have to pay a bounty to make them make
players<00:03:11.670> play<00:03:12.030> harder<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.630> mean<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.080> not

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
players play harder I mean that's not

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.610 
players play harder I mean that's not
necessarily<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.520> bad<00:03:15.150> thing<00:03:15.210> if<00:03:15.720> they're

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
necessarily a bad thing if they're

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.940 
necessarily a bad thing if they're
playing<00:03:17.390> harder<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:18.720> you're<00:03:18.900> when<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.650> go

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
playing harder but if you're when you go

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.170 
playing harder but if you're when you go
to<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> point<00:03:20.400> where<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.640> try<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.820> hurt

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
to the point where you try to hurt

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.060 
to the point where you try to hurt
somebody<00:03:21.210> that's<00:03:22.020> where<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.440> draws<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.920> line

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
somebody that's where it draws the line

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.300 
somebody that's where it draws the line
and<00:03:23.430> that's<00:03:23.970> why<00:03:24.270> it's<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.480> problem<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.980> good

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
and that's why it's a problem it's good

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.710 
and that's why it's a problem it's good
that<00:03:26.460> they<00:03:26.550> were<00:03:26.610> playing<00:03:26.880> hard<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:27.480> playing

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that they were playing hard and playing

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.310 
that they were playing hard and playing
clean<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.950> mean<00:03:29.510> if<00:03:30.510> you're<00:03:31.020> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> play

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
clean but I mean if you're going to play

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.800 
clean but I mean if you're going to play
dirty<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.160> try<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.580> injure<00:03:32.970> someone<00:03:33.210> that's<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
dirty and try to injure someone that's a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.320 
dirty and try to injure someone that's a
problem<00:03:34.070> now<00:03:35.070> another<00:03:35.340> thing<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:36.030> happened

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
agent it was the hot commodity the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.600 
agent it was the hot commodity the
Saints<00:03:49.770> were<00:03:49.860> doing<00:03:50.040> everything<00:03:50.280> they<00:03:50.550> could

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
Saints were doing everything they could

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.870 
Saints were doing everything they could
to<00:03:50.820> sign<00:03:51.180> him<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:53.100> comes<00:03:53.400> up<00:03:53.670> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
to sign him and then this comes up and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.580 
to sign him and then this comes up and
there's<00:03:54.300> probably<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.290> there's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
there's probably because of this there's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.370 
there's probably because of this there's
probably<00:03:55.800> suspensions<00:03:56.640> maybe<00:03:57.630> lots<00:03:57.960> of<00:03:58.140> draft

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
probably suspensions maybe lots of draft

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.420 
probably suspensions maybe lots of draft
picks<00:03:58.590> fine<00:03:59.460> stuff<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:02.190> I'm

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
picks fine stuff like that so if I'm

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.010 
picks fine stuff like that so if I'm
breeze<00:04:02.760> I'm<00:04:03.090> thinking<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.540> got<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:03.990> of

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
breeze I'm thinking I got to get out of

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.920 
breeze I'm thinking I got to get out of
here<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.370> Saints<00:04:05.940> made<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> smart<00:04:06.780> move

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
here but the Saints made a smart move

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.280 
here but the Saints made a smart move
and<00:04:07.350> franchise<00:04:08.070> tag<00:04:08.460> breeze<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.630> he<00:04:09.900> has<00:04:10.140> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
and franchise tag breeze so he has to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.590 
and franchise tag breeze so he has to
play<00:04:10.440> another<00:04:10.770> year<00:04:11.160> with<00:04:11.340> them<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.850> he<00:04:12.300> can't

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
play another year with them and he can't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080 
play another year with them and he can't
leave<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.200> hopefully<00:04:13.830> hopefully<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.850> Saints

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
leave and hopefully hopefully the Saints

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.650 
leave and hopefully hopefully the Saints
are<00:04:15.150> hoping<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.540> this<00:04:16.530> will<00:04:17.130> all<00:04:17.220> be<00:04:18.150> water

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
are hoping that this will all be water

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.240 
are hoping that this will all be water
under<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.080> bridge<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.710> everything<00:04:20.070> will<00:04:20.160> be

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
under the bridge and everything will be

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.430 
under the bridge and everything will be
fine<00:04:20.430> by<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.820> time<00:04:20.910> Brees<00:04:21.570> contract

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
fine by the time Brees contract

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.220 
fine by the time Brees contract
negotiation<00:04:23.479> negotiations<00:04:24.530> restart

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
negotiation negotiations restart

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.860 
negotiation negotiations restart
and<00:04:26.380> that's<00:04:27.010> kind<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:28.060> what<00:04:28.210> they<00:04:28.360> tried<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.630> do

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and that's kind of what they tried to do

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.540 
and that's kind of what they tried to do
there<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.500> think<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.800> was<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.920> very<00:04:30.160> smart

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
there and I think it was a very smart

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.240 
there and I think it was a very smart
move<00:04:30.730> on<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.060> Saints<00:04:31.390> part<00:04:31.860> considering<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
move on the Saints part considering the

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.330 
move on the Saints part considering the
stuff<00:04:33.880> that<00:04:34.030> they're<00:04:34.150> dealing<00:04:34.330> with<00:04:35.340> now

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
stuff that they're dealing with now

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.760 
stuff that they're dealing with now
that's<00:04:37.000> pretty<00:04:37.900> much<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:38.290> have<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.560> talk

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
that's pretty much all have to talk

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.040 
that's pretty much all have to talk
about<00:04:38.950> today<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:40.210> give<00:04:40.360> my<00:04:40.540> feelings

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
about today just give my feelings

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.490 
about today just give my feelings
telling<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.560> what<00:04:41.770> happened<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:43.020> mean<00:04:44.020> that's

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
telling you what happened I mean that's

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
telling you what happened I mean that's
I<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.480> move<00:04:46.660> with<00:04:46.930> breeze<00:04:47.340> because<00:04:48.340> he

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
I like the move with breeze because he

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.520 
I like the move with breeze because he
is<00:04:48.640> an<00:04:48.760> elite<00:04:49.000> quarterback<00:04:49.300> um<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:53.290> that's

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
is an elite quarterback um so that's

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.600 
is an elite quarterback um so that's
pretty<00:04:53.950> much<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.190> for<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.640> video<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:56.340> do<00:04:57.340> want

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
pretty much it for this video I do want

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.420 
pretty much it for this video I do want
to<00:04:57.700> say<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:58.180> right<00:04:58.390> now<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.800> VCU<00:04:59.800> Drexel
