00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.239
 danone 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.699
 when 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.069
 the bottom 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.040
 again for a few months for shares and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 it's a dinner 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.239
 it's not a fit 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.510
 daniel j 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.220

 that is the title of the coming piano for two years 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.290
 that provides connection 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.989
 in short but he is 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.479
 at the baquba 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.559
 I am not worried more than the demand in power 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.089
 the chances of a different date being different because I have to say no, you know 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.709
 what 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.969
 but I was completely ready to play 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.779
 afterwards was a problem 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.199
 become the points 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.199
 but the wage demands 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.409
 my own agenda 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.709
 something the opta in value 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.479
 Daniella Batman and the lead always made that 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.389
 except for that 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.580
 then it all went 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.539
 In addition, the old crafts are also added 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.849
 then it all went 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.759
 we have not made the subject too long 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.640
 when I actually did it 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.569
 on Monday 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.779
 then it all went 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.069
 On top of that, we don't have too long 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.259

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.849
