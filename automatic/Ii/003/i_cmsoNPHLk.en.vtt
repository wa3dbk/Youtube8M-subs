it and it's really pretty and this only

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
it and it's really pretty and this only
needs<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> coast<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.329> still<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
needs like to coast it's still kind of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050

sheer<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.640> away<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.970> just

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
sheer but you can get away with just

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840 
sheer but you can get away with just
using<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.780> coats<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.860> love<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.579> well
