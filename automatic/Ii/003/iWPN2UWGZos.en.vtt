00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and then gang beauty that spoke to today ig 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.130
 came to bring you a gameplay here 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.230
 of sabotage or sabotage for those who 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.420
 think i'm hunger games 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 microsoft servers is wrong one that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.100
 I really like it too, and I miss motegi. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 that is the same site there but I want to have it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
 at least one site that hunger games 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.250
 ipva is in the description and I'll try 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.019
 explain a little to you 45 seconds 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.119
 that I have is starting game 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 how does it work that sabotage 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 sabotage will be the vote the baggage is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.360
 Crazy, you're on then, come on, you go. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.329
 enter the game you will have three classes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.290
 here are the saboteurs the detective and the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 innocent 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.420
 here you will only have a number of detective 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 innocent in few saboteurs but 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.489
 basically this so can at the end 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.710
 to win only the saboteurs or the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.399
 innocent and the detective tone how 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.750
 it works 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.239
 think of that game you have to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.649
 discover the killer you being the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 saboteur you have a little advantage 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 Because you can know who wants your 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 own team and who is your enemy 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.030
 Since you're being innocent, you're not 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 Can you tell who is who you are? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.390
 have to do some testing some 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 so let's say that you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 always be suspicious of someone who 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 You're close to you, you have to know. 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.259
 if the cacique finds out if the face is or 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 not a friend or foe in the case 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.430
 So when the match started, it 's us. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 have to run to get chests 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 that 's a chelsea leader a bonbon of 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 pick up because they usually come bon jovi a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 take party was not that good 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 because as I have seen it is that the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 server or parents speaks of faith is one thing 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 so cool, I'm fine now 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 so what will happen as I am the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 single VIP here probably personal goes 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.420
 I suspect the saboteur because I 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.329
 I used a live start I can use the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.210
 saboteur bar calls the deal you 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.340
 will be placed on the list of three 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.219
 saboteurs or three jeeps can be 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 chosen as saboteurs but I am not 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.820
 the only one will have other saboteurs here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.310
 around then what is my goal 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
 here kill all the innocents that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.479
 I will appear with the green name and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 the only detective to appear with the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.289
 blue name and everybody knows who it is 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.670
 innocent detective and saboteurs 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.020
 obvious that they also know then 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.760
 What I try to do here in the beginning of 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.160
 game kill the guys who are like this 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.800
 Alone because if I come and attack 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.030
 it will be 3,600 that the faces are together 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.920
 they will distrust me 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 boot maybe frame back here beauty 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 I killed the first innocent the guys go 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 distrust of me then it has to be 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.750
 always always cautious always in the caution 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.030
 hiding one by one 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.860
 I'm going to have to give something back here. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.890
 I think it's cool to tell you when 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.330
 You kill a guy that you have to kill. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.360
 that is your goal when you 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.819
 buy a goal you will win face 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.650
 the face is the score you get 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.560
 the game resumes I think with 500 and not 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.720
 I remember and are represented in the books 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.769
 of experience in the case I have there 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.450
 saboteur face 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.569
 So this guy who belongs to my team at 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.890
 case of 15 thousand 985 experience points 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.500
 of karma né 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.510
 karma occupies the guy takes a party 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.100
 caracas and when you kill a guy from 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 your team in case you kill a saboteur 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.810
 now I'm going to lose this job 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.580
 Another cool thing to show 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.769
 for you here only I usually do not 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.230
 I use a lot because I do not have it, I do not have it 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.180
 custom to actually use is the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.209
 mall and the in-game store that you 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.400
 can buy some items some bonuses 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.019
 if you press here you can bar 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.030
 see some advantages you can 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.030
 I usually buy a body. 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.859
 because I know there for some reason I 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.140
 I like to save the car I accumulated 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.400
 The more cars you have, the more 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.950
 Legal understood 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.359
 basically this shows the level you 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.180
 in the game but also has no 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.459
 problem of buying items that this 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.380
 dude, I sometimes had to buy 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.900
 for example pmt because I was half 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.790
 Who trapped in the game is naughty booted here? 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 I'm going back here. 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.209
 I died who is this guy that 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.400
 face that is not a saboteur then you have to 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.799
 kill also the face is with hand armor 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.950
 bastard 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.019
 Our car has risen to blame opa. 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 here is a bit different from the bus and not 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.060
 have that soup as if if you can 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.859
 wanting to have the drug guy in 2005 I'm going 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.329
 have to go to the guys who do not 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.700
 has a soup system is a bit more 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.010
 complicated you died died understood 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.799
 Wow, I really like playing with 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.500
 two innocents and hit them do not know 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.850
 that they really are 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.730
 understood why they are not aware 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.710
 only the saboteurs who know who they are 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.240
 who invested to fall below did not 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.550
 fell on top I'll try to kill him from here 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.250
 a did not give popular way then 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.380
 community as the guys said they did not 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.360
 know who to understand why this 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.790
 router is a bit of an advantage over the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.070
 The least I like a little sometimes I 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.130
 I end up playing innocent and if I 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.980
 lucky I get along well and do not go through drugs 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.020
 fish this one is one of the guys that I 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.130
 I have to kill 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.810
 Let me see if there's any more 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.870
 saboteurs with me 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.580
 The guy is up there, I can not see 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.260
 But I think I think I'm the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.390
 Hell, it's all going to be a little late now. 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.340
 difficult staff will distrust me and 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.750
 will try to kill me 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.150
 Let's see here I'll try to get this one. 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.620
 face that is dead love is not alone 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.220
 was killed 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.610
 I enjoyed that I already told the detective dead 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.770
 For anyone who ever plays, you can 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.780
 examine bodies that are dead 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.850
 it's a good thing you can know who 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.200
 killed who if I'm not mistaken is this me 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.000
 I do not really like playing on the edge for 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.190
 tell the truth my business is to play the 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.979
 saboteur to leave killing everyone plays 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.919
 also alone here to try 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.640
 eliminate the guys, they changed the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.350

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.630

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.220
 they did there in Spanish then they have 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.200
 some maps that I do not know much about 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.810
 well because there are some parts we're going 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.370
 say so secrets and can enter and is 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.410
 hard to figure out 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.960
