to install a tempering valve now for
some<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:59.210> 120<00:01:00.210> degrees<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.699> good

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
some reason 120 degrees is a really good

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.460 
some reason 120 degrees is a really good
temperature<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.199> grow<00:01:04.440> bacteria<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:06.470> 140

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
temperature to grow bacteria and 140

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.740 
temperature to grow bacteria and 140
degrees<00:01:07.610> kills<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.380> found<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
degrees kills it what they found is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.590 
degrees kills it what they found is
certain<00:01:12.750> people<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.230> getting<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.530> sick<00:01:14.160> and

you got sick from your water heater

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.430 
you got sick from your water heater
because<00:01:21.810> your<00:01:22.590> doctor<00:01:23.100> may<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.150> a

because your doctor may just see it as a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.650 
because your doctor may just see it as a
respiratory<00:01:25.440> infection<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.120> pick<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.510> up

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
respiratory infection you can pick it up

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.050 
respiratory infection you can pick it up
in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> shower<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.980> steam<00:01:29.370> mist<00:01:29.730> if<00:01:29.940> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
in the shower from the steam mist if you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
in the shower from the steam mist if you
inhale<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:30.870> know<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> bacteria<00:01:32.190> will

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
inhale it you know the bacteria will

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
inhale it you know the bacteria will
travel<00:01:32.940> right<00:01:33.210> through<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.510> pipes<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.080> come

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
travel right through the pipes and come

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.000 
travel right through the pipes and come
out<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.580> also<00:01:35.730> get<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
out you can also get it if you got in to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.250 
out you can also get it if you got in to
drink<00:01:38.010> hot<00:01:38.250> water<00:01:38.330> supposedly<00:01:39.330> there's<00:01:40.170> a

drink hot water supposedly there's a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.370 
drink hot water supposedly there's a
couple<00:01:40.650> things<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:42.090> grow<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.990> that

couple things that can grow in here that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
couple things that can grow in here that
are<00:01:43.530> pretty<00:01:43.740> bad<00:01:43.980> one<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.640> Legionnaires

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
are pretty bad one is Legionnaires

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.900 
are pretty bad one is Legionnaires
disease<00:01:45.330> which<00:01:46.110> everybody's<00:01:46.620> heard<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
disease which everybody's heard of the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.630 
disease which everybody's heard of the
other<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:50.600> NTM<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.410> is

there<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.200> don't<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.410> any<00:02:26.680> hard<00:02:26.980> numbers

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
there you don't have any hard numbers

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970 
there you don't have any hard numbers
now<00:02:27.640> because<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:29.080> isn't<00:02:29.410> being<00:02:29.530> looked<00:02:29.800> at

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
now because this isn't being looked at

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.100 
now because this isn't being looked at
properly<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:30.760> they<00:02:31.030> suspect<00:02:31.600> there's<00:02:32.050> a

properly but they suspect there's a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.980 
properly but they suspect there's a
possibility<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.130> between<00:02:33.910> five<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.630> twelve

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
possibility that between five to twelve

possibility that between five to twelve
thousand<00:02:35.650> people<00:02:35.800> are<00:02:36.130> dying<00:02:36.430> from<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
thousand people are dying from this a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.050 
thousand people are dying from this a
year<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.980> said<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.370> cure<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.700> very

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
year so like I said the cure is very

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.600 
year so like I said the cure is very
simple<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.830> run<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.100> water<00:02:42.250> heater

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
simple you have to run the water heater

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.660 
simple you have to run the water heater
or<00:02:42.850> 140<00:02:43.510> degrees<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:44.650> order<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.400> and

this and make sure to make sure it's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.050 
this and make sure to make sure it's
right<00:03:10.300> now<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.110> valve<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.680> take<00:03:11.890> off<00:03:12.070> 5000

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
right now this valve the take off 5000

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.930 
right now this valve the take off 5000
is<00:03:13.270> really<00:03:13.630> nice<00:03:13.810> valve<00:03:14.140> because<00:03:14.920> it's<00:03:15.730> got

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
is really nice valve because it's got

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.509 
is really nice valve because it's got
high<00:03:16.150> flow<00:03:16.480> rate<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.530> will<00:03:17.709> flow<00:03:17.920> about<00:03:18.160> 20

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
high flow rate this will flow about 20

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.430 
high flow rate this will flow about 20
gallons<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:19.000> minute<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:20.050> it<00:03:20.110> won't<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.410> a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
gallons a minute so it won't be a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.259 
gallons a minute so it won't be a
restriction<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.640> could<00:03:21.850> still<00:03:22.090> take

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
restriction so you could still take

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.940 
restriction so you could still take
multiple<00:03:22.720> showers<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.380> can<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> dishes

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
multiple showers you can do the dishes

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.270 
multiple showers you can do the dishes
at<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.250> same<00:03:24.519> time<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.110> also<00:03:26.260> got<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.950> lot

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
at the same time and it's also got a lot

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.060 
at the same time and it's also got a lot

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
mixes the two together out to your sinks

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.850 
mixes the two together out to your sinks
and<00:04:27.639> 120<00:04:28.639> degrees<00:04:29.229> but<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.320> key<00:04:30.530> thing<00:04:30.830> here

and 120 degrees but the key thing here
and<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.850> should<00:04:32.000> be<00:04:32.030> done<00:04:32.300> on<00:04:32.960> all<00:04:33.440> hot<00:04:33.620> water

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
and this should be done on all hot water

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.610 
and this should be done on all hot water
installations<00:04:34.639> is<00:04:35.060> there's<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.990> thermal<00:04:36.350> trap

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
installations is there's a thermal trap

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.800 
installations is there's a thermal trap
now<00:04:36.919> what<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.070> thermal<00:04:37.430> trap<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.449> drop

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
now what a thermal trap is it's a drop

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.060 
now what a thermal trap is it's a drop
from<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.800> hot<00:04:39.979> water<00:04:40.010> outlet<00:04:40.870> down<00:04:42.070> before

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
from the hot water outlet down before

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.500 
from the hot water outlet down before
you<00:04:43.280> go<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.850> sinks

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
you go to the sinks

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.350 
you go to the sinks
what<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.229> does<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.949> it<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.460> traps<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.180> hot

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
what this does is it it traps the hot

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.870 
what this does is it it traps the hot
water<00:04:47.660> in<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.740> water<00:04:48.979> heater<00:04:49.280> when<00:04:49.729> you're

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
water in the water heater when you're

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.300 
water in the water heater when you're
not<00:04:50.000> running<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.540> faucets<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.380> that

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
not running the faucets and that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.670 
not running the faucets and that
increases<00:04:52.820> efficiency<00:04:52.940> if<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:54.169> pipe<00:04:54.410> just

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
increases efficiency if the pipe just

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.830 
increases efficiency if the pipe just
came<00:04:54.860> out<00:04:55.039> and<00:04:55.190> went<00:04:55.310> straight<00:04:55.580> up<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.630> hot

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
came out and went straight up the hot

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.900 
came out and went straight up the hot
water<00:04:57.139> would<00:04:57.470> constantly<00:04:58.070> chase<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.639> cold

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
water would constantly chase the cold

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.480 
water would constantly chase the cold
pipes<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.080> would<00:05:00.199> constantly<00:05:00.680> be<00:05:00.800> losing

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
pipes and it would constantly be losing

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.670 
pipes and it would constantly be losing
heat<00:05:01.729> out<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.030> water<00:05:02.210> heater<00:05:02.510> this<00:05:03.260> this

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
heat out of the water heater this this

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.860 
heat out of the water heater this this
traps<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.880> wolf<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.210> hop<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.630> heat

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
traps that and the wolf the hop the heat

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.390 
traps that and the wolf the hop the heat
can't<00:05:06.199> come<00:05:06.410> out<00:05:06.530> on<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.740> water<00:05:06.949> heater<00:05:07.160> when

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
can't come out on the water heater when

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.800 
can't come out on the water heater when
it's<00:05:07.550> off<00:05:07.789> but<00:05:08.630> what<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.900> also<00:05:08.960> does<00:05:09.350> is<00:05:10.039> it

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
it's off but what that also does is it

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.450 
it's off but what that also does is it
lengthens<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.900> life<00:05:12.199> of<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.620> valve<00:05:12.860> because

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
lengthens the life of the valve because

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.430 
lengthens the life of the valve because
this<00:05:13.580> has<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:13.760> thermostatic<00:05:14.570> element<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:15.199> there

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
this has a thermostatic element in there

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.189 
this has a thermostatic element in there
and<00:05:15.680> if<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.699> have<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.120> tied<00:05:17.479> in<00:05:17.690> right<00:05:17.960> out

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
and if you have this tied in right out

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.990 
and if you have this tied in right out
of<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.440> hot<00:05:18.620> outlet<00:05:19.220> it's<00:05:19.729> going<00:05:19.940> to

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
of the hot outlet it's going to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.990 
of the hot outlet it's going to
constantly<00:05:20.600> be<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.680> know<00:05:21.770> 24/7<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:22.850> going

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
constantly be you know 24/7 it's going

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.550 
constantly be you know 24/7 it's going
to<00:05:23.060> be<00:05:23.150> trying<00:05:23.389> to<00:05:23.570> open<00:05:23.930> because<00:05:24.080> it's<00:05:24.350> hot

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
to be trying to open because it's hot

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.409 
to be trying to open because it's hot
you<00:05:25.070> want<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.310> give<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:25.550> valve<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:25.970> break<00:05:26.210> you

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
you want to give this valve a break you

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.150 
you want to give this valve a break you
only<00:05:26.570> want<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:27.020> run<00:05:27.229> when<00:05:27.800> you're<00:05:27.979> actually

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
only want it to run when you're actually

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.070 
only want it to run when you're actually
running<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.700> hot<00:05:28.849> water<00:05:29.120> so<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.539> that<00:05:29.870> does

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
running the hot water so that that does

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.529 
running the hot water so that that does
two<00:05:30.289> things<00:05:30.320> for<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:31.060> what<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.150> want<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.419> do

is make sure your contractor puts this

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.390 
is make sure your contractor puts this
trapping<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:36.050> what<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.410> need<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.860> at<00:05:37.070> least
