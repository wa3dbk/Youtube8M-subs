00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.590
 sado 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 a product with nanotechnology that is 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.540
 revolutionizing the engine market 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.240
 history in oil drilling 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.660
 from Russia it was discovered that the drill bits of 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.939
 perforation were maintained without wear 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.970
 studied the clay and synthesized it in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.150
 laboratory this paste applied to the engine 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.150
 of the car allows to revitalize the engine and 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.309
 retrieve it like when it was new as 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.129
 save gas according to reports of 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.030
 customers there is a savings of up to 5 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.980
 gallons in a tank of 15 this is a 33 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 percent of road savings but 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.550
 wait, this is not all 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.950
 increase compression 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.690
 Sado levels and increases the compression of 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.180
 the cylinders from 130 to 140 psi this 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 means more strength better pique is 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.290
 that sado has filled all the spaces 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.080
 worn out wait there's still more emission 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.020
 of gases the gases of monoxide and dioxide 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.140
 of carbon are burned in their entirety 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.080
 in the camera reducing them or eliminating 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.420
 the some testimonies confirm that if 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.630
 they have passed the review but there is more 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.090
 noises the noises of the internal parts 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.060
 as the thrusters and valves are 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.740
 almost immediately remove all this with 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.820
 a single treatment for 100 thousand 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.580
 kilometers look at those who try it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.890
 oil consumption you say your engine 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.780
 it's fine but notes that change to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.630
 change you have to add maybe a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.509
 quarter or more of oil this is not normal 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.420
 is that it escapes in the form of smoke and not 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.670
 you see it you already have wear on the engine 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.539
 but you do not feel use certificates 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.619
 volkswagen volvo man op the mercedes benz 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.179
 general Motors 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.630
 in short savings in gasoline 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.880
 refinement of gas emission engine 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.100
 maintenance but you lack something else the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.739
 driving pleasure when you feel the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.069
 new sensation in your hands rebates to 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.160
 others you leave behind feel speed 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.070
 power to the maximum until you ask yourself is 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.510
 This my used car gives you the guarantee of 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.390
 functioning 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.250
 It does not matter if your car is new or used 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.280
 You have protection for 100,000 kilometers 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.170
 Now that you know how it works 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.140
 then you will understand that if you save 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.420
 fuel that does protect you and even 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.580
 You can sell it at a better price

 sado the solution
