the<00:00:02.190> idea<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.210> develop<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.170> camera

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the idea to develop a camera

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.130 
the idea to develop a camera
stabilization<00:00:05.069> system<00:00:05.850> like<00:00:06.060> Luth<00:00:06.299> came<00:00:06.960> up

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
stabilization system like Luth came up

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.230 
stabilization system like Luth came up
from<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:07.529> own<00:00:07.710> needs<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.309> was<00:00:08.639> filming<00:00:08.910> with

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
from my own needs I was filming with

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.509 
from my own needs I was filming with
action<00:00:09.660> cams<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> past<00:00:10.530> eight<00:00:10.800> years<00:00:11.040> and

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
action cams for the past eight years and

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.340 
action cams for the past eight years and
always<00:00:12.269> an<00:00:12.719> adaptive<00:00:13.290> shaky<00:00:13.860> footage<00:00:15.170> to<00:00:16.170> get
