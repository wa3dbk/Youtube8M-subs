00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.600 

just<00:05:36.160> like<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.560> even<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.740> app<00:05:38.950> supports

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.090 
just like that and even the app supports
multi-touch<00:05:40.410> multitasking<00:05:41.410> features<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.070> we

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
multi-touch multitasking features so we

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.360

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
can go out there go in here and then

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.210 
can go out there go in here and then
we're<00:05:46.330> gonna<00:05:46.420> go<00:05:46.720> back<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.410> we'll<00:05:47.860> be<00:05:47.980> right

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220
