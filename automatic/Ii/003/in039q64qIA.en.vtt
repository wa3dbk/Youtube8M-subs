whilst<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:56.210> yeah<00:00:57.210> it's

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
whilst I just do this and yeah it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
whilst I just do this and yeah it's
pretty<00:00:57.449> much<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.809> I've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.020> assure<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
pretty much all I've got assure you I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
pretty much all I've got assure you I
think<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.219> uses<00:00:59.489> sixty<00:00:59.820> percent<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
think it uses sixty percent of the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479 
think it uses sixty percent of the
special<00:01:00.809> bear<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.559> not<00:01:01.770> too<00:01:01.949> bad<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
special bear which is not too bad to be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
special bear which is not too bad to be
honest<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.149> hit<00:01:03.570> twice<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
honest you can hit twice if you have a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
honest you can hit twice if you have a
spec<00:01:06.150> restore<00:01:06.540> portion<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> pretty

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.969 
going to go out I'd suggest switching
your<00:01:43.409> prayer<00:01:43.799> book<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.640> normal<00:01:45.360> book<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
your prayer book to the normal book and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.240 
your prayer book to the normal book and
get<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> few<00:01:47.340> errands<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:49.250> casting

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
get in a few errands and then casting

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
get in a few errands and then casting
windrush<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.450> allow<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> attack

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
windrush which will allow you to attack

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
windrush which will allow you to attack
them<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.340> only<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.820> click<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.409> allow<00:01:55.409> you

them with only one click and allow you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
them with only one click and allow you
to<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> fastest<00:01:56.189> kills<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to get the fastest kills because it's

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.550 
to get the fastest kills because it's
absolutely<00:01:57.600> packed<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.110> they'll<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.439> like
