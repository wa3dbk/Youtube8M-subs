find this absolutely intriguing and that
is<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.620> fact<00:00:36.890> that<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:37.940> may<00:00:38.120> have<00:00:38.149> found

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
is the fact that we may have found

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.600 
is the fact that we may have found
evidence<00:00:38.870> of<00:00:39.350> an<00:00:40.190> ancient<00:00:40.370> culture<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.420> people

evidence of an ancient culture of people

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.990 
evidence of an ancient culture of people
that<00:00:43.610> may<00:00:43.820> well<00:00:44.059> in<00:00:44.269> fact<00:00:44.540> be<00:00:45.019> a<00:00:45.760> subspecies<00:00:46.760> of

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
that may well in fact be a subspecies of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.619 
that may well in fact be a subspecies of
human<00:00:47.629> being<00:00:47.870> that<00:00:48.260> died<00:00:48.500> out<00:00:49.180> now<00:00:50.180> what<00:00:50.570> I'm

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
human being that died out now what I'm

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.479 
human being that died out now what I'm
going<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.809> show<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.050> our<00:00:51.409> examples<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.280> this

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
going to show you our examples of this

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.570 
going to show you our examples of this
and<00:00:52.820> why<00:00:53.629> academia<00:00:54.589> has<00:00:54.739> not<00:00:54.949> taken<00:00:55.159> interest

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
and why academia has not taken interest

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.450 
and why academia has not taken interest
I<00:00:55.879> have<00:00:56.089> no<00:00:56.239> idea<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:59.379> these<00:01:00.379> are<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.280> two

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
I have no idea but these are the two

that they are the result of cranial
deformation<00:01:21.700> however<00:01:22.720> there<00:01:23.720> are<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.049> number

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
deformation however there are a number

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.450 
deformation however there are a number
of<00:01:24.470> factors<00:01:25.000> which<00:01:26.000> seemed<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.420> indicate<00:01:26.720> that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
of factors which seemed to indicate that

of factors which seemed to indicate that
these<00:01:28.460> may<00:01:28.820> in<00:01:29.120> fact<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:30.550> different

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
these may in fact be a different

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.990 
these may in fact be a different
subspecies<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.480> humanity

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000

for<00:01:35.000> example<00:01:35.710> what<00:01:36.710> I'm<00:01:36.800> going<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:37.070> show<00:01:37.250> you

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
for example what I'm going to show you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.740 
for example what I'm going to show you
is<00:01:38.830> what<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:39.920> regarded<00:01:40.070> as<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:41.000> normal<00:01:41.420> human

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
is what is regarded as a normal human

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.630 
is what is regarded as a normal human
skull<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:45.440> one<00:01:45.940> we<00:01:46.940> know<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:48.640> from

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
skull this one we know that this is from

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.290 
skull this one we know that this is from
the<00:01:49.670> Inca<00:01:50.180> period<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.900> it's<00:01:51.080> approximately

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
the Inca period so it's approximately

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.900 
the Inca period so it's approximately
600<00:01:53.300> years<00:01:53.480> old<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.100> what<00:01:55.310> your<00:01:55.520> skull

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
600 years old this is what your skull

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.820 
600 years old this is what your skull
basically<00:01:56.690> looks<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> important

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically looks like the important

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.900 
basically looks like the important
feature<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:59.140> here<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.040> see<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.280> number<00:02:01.730> of

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
feature is here you see the number of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.270 
feature is here you see the number of
cranial<00:02:02.750> plates<00:02:03.110> there<00:02:03.560> are<00:02:03.710> three<00:02:04.010> major

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
cranial plates there are three major

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.860 
cranial plates there are three major
ones<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:06.110> frontal<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.490> two<00:02:07.670> parietals

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.470 

but<00:02:11.870> what<00:02:12.050> I'm<00:02:12.140> going<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.350> show<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.620> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
but what I'm going to show you is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.030 
but what I'm going to show you is
different<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:16.520> one<00:02:16.790> specifically<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.830> can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
different this one specifically you can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.860 
different this one specifically you can
see<00:02:19.250> only<00:02:19.430> has<00:02:19.880> two<00:02:20.440> cranial<00:02:21.440> plates<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.870> this

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
see only has two cranial plates and this

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.120 
see only has two cranial plates and this
one

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.380 

possibly<00:02:29.130> three<00:02:29.670> however<00:02:32.000> notice<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> shape

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
possibly three however notice the shape

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.390 
possibly three however notice the shape
of<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> skull<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.350> back<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.890> its<00:02:35.100> domed

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
of the skull in the back how its domed

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.100 
of the skull in the back how its domed
like<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.030> where<00:02:36.300> there's<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.630> depression

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
like this where there's this depression

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.620 
like this where there's this depression
here<00:02:42.110> now<00:02:43.110> some<00:02:43.500> people<00:02:43.710> would<00:02:44.130> say<00:02:44.630> that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
here now some people would say that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.080 
here now some people would say that
deformation<00:02:46.110> caused<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> child's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
deformation caused this that the child's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.890 
deformation caused this that the child's
skull<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> child<00:02:51.210> was<00:02:51.360> very<00:02:51.630> young

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
skull at when the child was very young

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
skull at when the child was very young
that<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.920> head<00:02:53.070> was<00:02:53.100> deformed<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:54.120> purpose<00:02:55.020> in

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
that the head was deformed on purpose in

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.310 
that the head was deformed on purpose in
order<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.400> achieve<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:57.030> look<00:02:57.330> however<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
order to achieve this look however the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
order to achieve this look however the
more<00:02:58.670> skulls<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.740> more<00:03:01.740> examples

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
more skulls that we have more examples

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 
more skulls that we have more examples
that<00:03:02.580> we<00:03:02.700> look<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.900> more<00:03:04.170> evidence<00:03:04.710> is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that we look at the more evidence is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.280 
that we look at the more evidence is
starting<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.580> suggest<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.740> these<00:03:07.740> are<00:03:08.160> not

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
starting to suggest that these are not

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.520 
starting to suggest that these are not
simply<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.680> result<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.990> deformation<00:03:15.530> but

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
simply the result of deformation but

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.020 
simply the result of deformation but
could<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.920> something<00:03:17.220> far<00:03:17.670> more<00:03:17.700> intriguing

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030
