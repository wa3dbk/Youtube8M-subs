00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 we saw some components of the radio the ram 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.630
 and the CPU 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 Now we're going to study the peripherals. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.529
 it is easy to identify the peripheral 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.429
 because it's all that 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.749
 I've found sumov but it's usually all that is not ram or cpu memory 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.199
 as a reader 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.589
 the speakers 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.839
 the keyboard 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.210
 I cursed the printer 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.140
 scandal 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.939
 multifunctional 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 the agave 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 CD player is that other components or devices that are characterized 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.790
 as peripherals 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 the peripherals they are classified according to their nature and states the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.890
 action 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.960
 with cpi hears the ram 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.410
 there is a peripheral for example 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.130
 which are classified as input peripherals 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.650
 and its nature 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.660
 is in a traveler trainings instructions 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.400
 of ram memory 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.180
 are peripheral examples of input 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.040
 the keyboard 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.370
 multi to web icann 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.580
 the scanner 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.910
 among others the microphone for example another strain is another and so by 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.830
 against 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 all that you are dieting year of registration 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.370
 the characters 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 they are shipped premier 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 RAM memory 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.240
 and not only the mother TormÃ© 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.530
 because it is what appears on your engine in reflection of what is stored 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.740
 the ram 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.530
 so when you type something 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.690
 this information, because fear 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.900
 instance 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.730
 to your memory ram 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.250
 there are other peripherals 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.390
 that make the reverse process 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.840
 they played the role said know information 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.900
 or cpu or ram instructions 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.250
 are examples 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.600
 and output peripherals 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.640
 monitoring 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.370
 the speakers 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.800
 the printer 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.780
 among others 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.269
 then expect to boil ate this monitor ' 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.779
 everything that is in the crooked world because he is receiving conformations of the memory 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.710
 cpu instructions 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.649
 that's why it only dies crooked 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.739
 and are peripheral output 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.539
 there are others the third type 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.229
 it depends 7 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.159
 that they perform both functions 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.789
 at the moment they 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.699
 finally an information 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.629
 cpu and ram instructions 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.669
 in another they 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.520
 I received instruction information 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.749
 of memory received 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.939
 they are the peripherals p 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.549
 storage 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.859
 example of them 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.389
 It's hdl 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.559
 cd player and pen drives and others 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.860
 these storage peripherals 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.030
 they are in and out 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.520
 david that process just come in the previous class of reading reading from 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.389
 files 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.259
 the moment I read a system file 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.649
 devices 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.649
 This is the moment when 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.000
 the moment I have files or information on my computer 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.639
 in my memory ram and precise salt we speak 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.399
 the process is the reverse 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.049
 it's the process 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.299
 receive information from these devices receive 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.029
 Remove it in ram 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.619
 the others positive the moment you save 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.789
 so that's why it's in and out 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.099
 entry into the electoral process 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.569
 this going in the process 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.309
 recording 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.519
 so here we can close the main concepts in relation to 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.109
 part 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.620
 we fear that it is a resident of the cpa or and the peripherals and are incoming 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.899
 output 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.689
 storage 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.489
 continuing here our lesson on fundamentals type of expression entities 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.419
 remembering that we've already seen the main concepts of roger and now 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.410
 we will 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.970
 deepen the knowledge about 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.750
 software that is what generates activity in the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.839
 computer 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.969
 then editing software 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:19.549
 classifieds 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.960
 basically three types operating systems 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.120
 the expert systems 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.279
 utilities 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.379
 the operating systems they are software that allows the operation of the 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.900
 computer 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.949
 it is rare a machine that does not have with the operating system the vast majority 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:37.909
 has 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.569
 the software that you probably 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.270
 I know the legal industry 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.349
 then all that line of the south hindu 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.069
 not only 11 xp in 95 98 limit 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.559
 windows 7 comes 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.229
 they are all operating systems 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.199
 they allow your computer to work 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.570
 basically this is it 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.710
 so when you Russian keyboard monitor mouse 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.599
 is that these devices are in operation 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.569
 is the operating system 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.030
 what excellence your devices 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.030
 it managing memory eg naming 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.379
 running other programs you are using for example 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.289
 text editors 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.949
 who to allocate by managing the processes that this program 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.099
 is the cooperation system in high 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.259
 it also controls storage part 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.339
 when you lose to write a file to read a file 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.339
 who controls it there is the operating system 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.449
 and look there is not only the windows we have operating there are several others 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.099
 a direct competitor of the piquet dewey has 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.180
 every day more eulina adepts conquered those who have several 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:49.669
 distributions out there 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.509
 I have the south the mac operating system the s2 has another called solar has a 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.759
 another called and unix and so on there are several of them 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.310
 or specialist systems or specialist software 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.000
 are specific programs 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.860
 for example a software program specific to pharmacy because the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.229
 pharmaceutical manipulate and medium 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.449
 is a very specific system needs specialization to use 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.509
 and the system itself has 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.360
 extremely specific functions 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.199
 it's so with 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.409
 in other programs with which they would make specific calculations prime port of 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:27.029
 income 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.199
 Calculus of them are weather 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.180
 balanced ration 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.240
 you see 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.270
 are extremely specialized systems specialists 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.749
 there are also utilities that are general activity softwares 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.589
 what is today 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.230
 excel is the power point and 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.580
 is hugo has a new senate kriss flax 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.479
 programs and utilities for you say text 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.710
 Image 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.760
 make presentations among other things, so it is 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.910
 ranking 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.409
 software 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.080
 so performing here 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.879
 we have by hardware that the physical part of the computer you saw 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.800
 the main components 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.750
 the cp oo ram the peripherals of input output and kneading and also 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.220
 have seen how the recording and reading process works 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.240
 and the relationship that ram and storage devices have 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.890
 If you have any questions, just go back and attend the first class. 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.800
 the software but we ended up explaining it has no great secrets why it 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.080
 said the study project in this course we can 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.290
 ward and 2007 excel 2007 by tom hanks 

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:46.439
 and the other piper who was ours did not kick the toulouse users of the 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:50.949
 computer users are ordinary users 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.489
 or what expert programmers analysts and everything else 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.849
