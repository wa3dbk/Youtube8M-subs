 complete and it's cool you test it yourself 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.680
 I've never played war is a good 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.320
 opportunity for you to understand which 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.300
 mechanics of the game this series was very 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.370
 famous because of the leather system 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.950
 that popularized it among the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.060
 third person shooter shots 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.040
 third person 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.680
 so a lot of people are probably going 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 buy for nostalgia even for power 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.920
 rescue this classic then in high 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.490
