okay<00:00:02.530> guys<00:00:02.730> we're<00:00:03.730> here<00:00:03.910> doing<00:00:04.089> another<00:00:04.330> test

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:04.660 
okay guys we're here doing another test

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.280 
okay guys we're here doing another test

Brown stink bugs this is a highly
diluted<00:00:17.350> version<00:00:17.769> of<00:00:18.220> one<00:00:19.210> of<00:00:19.240> our<00:00:19.449> compounds

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
diluted version of one of our compounds

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.859 
diluted version of one of our compounds
we've<00:00:20.380> just<00:00:20.650> placed<00:00:21.130> it<00:00:21.279> into<00:00:21.699> an<00:00:22.390> old<00:00:22.689> bottle

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
we've just placed it into an old bottle

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.200 
we've just placed it into an old bottle
and<00:00:23.289> ID<00:00:23.619> wrapper<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.220> it's<00:00:24.369> easier<00:00:24.670> to<00:00:24.910> apply

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
and ID wrapper so it's easier to apply

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.769 
and ID wrapper so it's easier to apply
and<00:00:25.869> we<00:00:26.769> can<00:00:26.949> control<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:28.179> amount<00:00:28.509> that<00:00:28.599> gets

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
and we can control the amount that gets

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.650 
and we can control the amount that gets
on<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.199> stink<00:00:29.439> bugs<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:30.759> little<00:00:31.330> bit<00:00:31.420> more

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
on the stink bugs a little bit more

compound on them and they are active as

compound on them and they are active as
you<00:00:48.789> can<00:00:48.910> see<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:50.320> don't<00:00:50.469> really<00:00:50.559> like<00:00:50.800> being

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
you can see they don't really like being

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.229 
you can see they don't really like being
in<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.750> here<00:00:53.079> but<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.340> did<00:00:54.670> notice<00:00:54.910> it's

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
in the in here but I did notice it's

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.319 
in the in here but I did notice it's
mid-june<00:00:55.600> right<00:00:55.899> now<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:57.550> are<00:00:57.730> some<00:00:58.090> young

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
mid-june right now there are some young

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.410 
mid-june right now there are some young
stink<00:00:58.780> bugs<00:00:59.430> that<00:01:00.430> I've<00:01:00.609> seen<00:01:00.879> floating

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
stink bugs that I've seen floating

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.180 
stink bugs that I've seen floating
around<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.949> means<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.500> first<00:01:05.500> bit<00:01:06.160> of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
around that means that the first bit of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.480 
around that means that the first bit of
eggs<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:07.120> been<00:01:07.360> laid<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:08.050> we<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.250> our

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
eggs that have been laid and we have our

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.000 
eggs that have been laid and we have our
new<00:01:09.760> generation<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.450> stink<00:01:10.720> bugs<00:01:10.900> out<00:01:11.170> here<00:01:11.200> I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
new generation of stink bugs out here I

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.900 
new generation of stink bugs out here I
was<00:01:12.550> lucky<00:01:13.000> enough<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.600> my<00:01:13.840> last<00:01:14.050> test<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:15.190> don't

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
was lucky enough on my last test I don't

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.810 
was lucky enough on my last test I don't
know<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.150> put<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:16.480> up<00:01:16.630> yet<00:01:17.140> or<00:01:17.170> not<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.790> I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
know if I put it up yet or not but I

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.970 
know if I put it up yet or not but I
found<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.390> green<00:01:19.660> stink<00:01:19.960> bug<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.290> test<00:01:20.560> one<00:01:20.860> of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
found a green stink bug to test one of

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.060 
found a green stink bug to test one of
our<00:01:21.070> compounds<00:01:21.640> on<00:01:21.760> this<00:01:22.690> compound

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
our compounds on this compound

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.560 
our compounds on this compound
specifically<00:01:24.070> make<00:01:25.060> sure<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.300> we<00:01:25.420> created<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
specifically make sure that we created I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.000 
specifically make sure that we created I
believe<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.810> going<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.080> be<00:01:29.170> highly<00:01:29.740> effective

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
believe is going to be highly effective

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.930 
believe is going to be highly effective
and<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.700> will<00:01:30.820> probably<00:01:31.180> kill<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.380> stink<00:01:32.620> bugs

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and it will probably kill the stink bugs

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.540 
and it will probably kill the stink bugs
faster<00:01:33.940> than<00:01:34.150> any<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.450> our<00:01:34.660> tests<00:01:35.550> previously

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
faster than any of our tests previously

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.630 
faster than any of our tests previously
combined<00:01:37.650> once<00:01:38.650> again<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:38.920> have<00:01:39.040> all<00:01:39.130> compound

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
combined once again we have all compound

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.630 
combined once again we have all compound
notes<00:01:40.560> chemical<00:01:41.560> properties<00:01:42.160> things<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.550> that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the ingredients that we've provided and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.420 
the ingredients that we've provided and
put<00:01:54.430> together<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.050> safe<00:01:56.260> working<00:01:56.470> manner

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
put together in a safe working manner

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.740 
put together in a safe working manner
that<00:01:58.300> any<00:01:58.660> homeowner<00:01:59.080> could<00:01:59.380> obtain<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:01.270> spray

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
that any homeowner could obtain a spray

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.140 
that any homeowner could obtain a spray
their<00:02:01.900> house<00:02:02.050> for<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.700> know<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:03.850> kill<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
their house for you know to kill the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.710 
their house for you know to kill the
stink<00:02:04.360> bugs<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.750> then<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.020> well<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:06.690> have<00:02:07.690> a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
stink bugs and then as well to have a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.180 
stink bugs and then as well to have a
residual<00:02:08.170> effect<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.830> they're<00:02:09.100> not

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
residual effect so that they're not

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.960 
residual effect so that they're not
going<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.369> want<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.610> come<00:02:09.759> back

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to want to come back

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910 
going to want to come back
but<00:02:12.150> anyway<00:02:12.690> we're<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> go<00:02:13.680> ahead<00:02:13.770> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but anyway we're going to go ahead and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.100 
but anyway we're going to go ahead and
we're<00:02:14.010> going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.160> test<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.490> out<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:16.080> how

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
we're going to test this out and see how

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.340 
we're going to test this out and see how
effective<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.580> compound<00:02:17.940> mixture<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
effective this compound mixture is so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:30.230 
effective this compound mixture is so
he's<00:02:19.500> gonna<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:29.100> don't<00:02:29.370> even<00:02:29.640> think<00:02:29.790> about<00:02:30.060> it

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
he's gonna you don't even think about it

have to think that you know you have to
be<00:04:34.140> careful

be careful

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.820 
be careful
commonsense<00:04:35.930> but<00:04:36.930> once<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.289> application<00:04:37.740> is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
commonsense but once the application is

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.420 
commonsense but once the application is
dried<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:39.390> maintains<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.229> residual<00:04:40.620> effect<00:04:40.680> so

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
dried it maintains a residual effect so

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.180 
dried it maintains a residual effect so
they're<00:04:41.760> if<00:04:42.660> they<00:04:42.870> do<00:04:42.960> come<00:04:43.169> back<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.410> come<00:04:44.070> in

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
they're if they do come back and come in

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.279 
they're if they do come back and come in
contact<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.729> will<00:04:44.850> kill<00:04:45.090> them

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
contact it will kill them

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.750 
contact it will kill them
but<00:04:46.740> more<00:04:46.919> than<00:04:46.979> likely<00:04:47.160> they're<00:04:47.460> just<00:04:47.640> going

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
but more than likely they're just going

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.719 
but more than likely they're just going
to<00:04:47.940> not<00:04:48.870> want<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.110> be<00:04:49.169> around<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.610> they

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
to not want to be around it and if they

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.149 
to not want to be around it and if they
do<00:04:50.789> they're<00:04:51.030> going<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.240> die<00:04:52.190> so

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
do they're going to die so

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.559 
do they're going to die so
this<00:04:54.909> is<00:04:55.029> very<00:04:55.270> very<00:04:55.539> good<00:04:55.749> stuff<00:04:56.369> or<00:04:57.369> right<00:04:58.360> at

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
this is very very good stuff or right at

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.589 
this is very very good stuff or right at
five<00:04:58.809> minutes<00:04:59.229> but<00:04:59.379> these<00:04:59.649> these<00:05:00.279> guys<00:05:00.599> they

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
five minutes but these these guys they

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.049 
five minutes but these these guys they
died<00:05:01.779> pretty<00:05:01.989> quick<00:05:02.429> quicker<00:05:03.429> than<00:05:03.729> any<00:05:03.909> of

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
died pretty quick quicker than any of

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:08.249 
died pretty quick quicker than any of
our<00:05:04.179> other<00:05:04.209> tests<00:05:05.009> or<00:05:06.009> compound<00:05:06.999> mixtures<00:05:07.360> and

our other tests or compound mixtures and

our other tests or compound mixtures and
I<00:05:08.439> believe<00:05:08.709> this<00:05:08.860> is<00:05:09.009> our<00:05:09.129> fourth<00:05:09.459> test<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.830> in

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
I believe this is our fourth test and in

I believe this is our fourth test and in
