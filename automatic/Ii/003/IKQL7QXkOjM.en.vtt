00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
of a patient stem cell research is

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.570 
of a patient stem cell research is
extremely<00:02:10.090> important<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.049> me<00:02:11.200> because<00:02:11.769> it's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
then they're walking without project to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.150 
then they're walking without project to
store<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.540> don't<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.079> would<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.920> much
