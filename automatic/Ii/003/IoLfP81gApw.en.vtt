clemency the hand of purity good against

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.569 
clemency the hand of purity good against
pretty<00:00:50.140> much<00:00:50.230> everybody<00:00:50.649> has<00:00:50.829> a<00:00:50.859> dot<00:00:51.160> now<00:00:51.370> so

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
pretty much everybody has a dot now so

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.160 
pretty much everybody has a dot now so
you<00:00:51.670> can<00:00:51.820> like<00:00:51.940> reduce<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.449> bleeds<00:00:52.960> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
you can like reduce the bleeds and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.410 
you can like reduce the bleeds and
damages<00:00:53.620> not<00:00:53.829> all<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.340> tease<00:00:54.640> by<00:00:55.059> seventy

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
damages not all do tease by seventy

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.889 
damages not all do tease by seventy
percent<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.559> then<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:56.859> got<00:00:56.980> clemency<00:00:57.489> which

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
percent and then you got clemency which

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.569 
percent and then you got clemency which
it's<00:00:58.899> similar<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.350> cold<00:00:59.739> snap<00:00:59.980> for<00:01:00.129> poly<00:01:00.340> but

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
it's similar to cold snap for poly but

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's similar to cold snap for poly but
it<00:01:00.699> only<00:01:00.850> affects<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.510> your<00:01:02.140> hands<00:01:02.679> so<00:01:02.980> you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
it only affects you of your hands so you

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.249 
it only affects you of your hands so you
handle<00:01:03.730> freedom<00:01:04.030> protection<00:01:04.479> sacrifice<00:01:05.019> and

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
handle freedom protection sacrifice and

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.520 
handle freedom protection sacrifice and
salvation<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.810> that's<00:01:08.020> pretty<00:01:08.170> much<00:01:08.289> about

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
salvation but that's pretty much about

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.020 
salvation but that's pretty much about
it<00:01:08.800> so<00:01:08.950> I<00:01:09.789> have<00:01:10.479> been<00:01:10.750> toying<00:01:10.990> around<00:01:11.200> with

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it so I have been toying around with

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.690 
it so I have been toying around with
these<00:01:13.030> these<00:01:13.450> level<00:01:14.319> 90<00:01:14.619> talents<00:01:14.979> holy<00:01:15.399> prism

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
these these level 90 talents holy prism

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.669 
these these level 90 talents holy prism
is<00:01:15.940> kind<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.209> like<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.330> laser<00:01:16.599> beam<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:17.470> does

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
is kind of like a laser beam it does

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.370 
is kind of like a laser beam it does
have<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.069> nice<00:01:18.250> little<00:01:18.520> cooldown<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:20.200> it

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
have a nice little cooldown but it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.190 
have a nice little cooldown but it
doesn't<00:01:20.770> seem<00:01:21.099> to<00:01:21.369> have<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.200> damaging

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
doesn't seem to have the damaging

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.949 
doesn't seem to have the damaging
properties<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.800> I'm<00:01:23.920> after<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.750> lights

properties that I'm after the lights

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:27.570 
properties that I'm after the lights
hammer<00:01:26.229> could<00:01:26.530> be<00:01:26.619> something<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.130> use<00:01:27.340> more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
hammer could be something to use more

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.960 
hammer could be something to use more
for<00:01:27.819> arenas<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.619> because<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.250> has<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.700> AOA

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
for arenas it because it has the AOA

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
it it's gonna take all the damage and

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.910 
it it's gonna take all the damage and
this<00:01:36.459> execution<00:01:37.060> sentence<00:01:37.599> is<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.500> one<00:01:38.709> that

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
this execution sentence is the one that

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.570 
this execution sentence is the one that
I<00:01:39.009> seem<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.369> like<00:01:39.489> the<00:01:39.610> most<00:01:39.849> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:41.459> check<00:01:42.459> in

I seem to like the most you can check in

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.300 
I seem to like the most you can check in
