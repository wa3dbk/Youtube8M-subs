00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.300
 good morning, my friends 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.580
 here I am once again with you for 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.070
 make him show a tip a recipe 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 natural to whiten the elbows now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 that we are going to do the first thing that you should 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 know how to whiten the elbows is to treat 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.289
 to remove all the dark skin that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 I will try to show you all the dark skin 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.140
 that looks around our elbow 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.520
 This is a stained or thick skin that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.160
 for them he must resort to cleaning it and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 exfoliate what we're going to do with a lot 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.830
 careful not to scream or hurt 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 our skin we are going to help us from a 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.100
 comex stone like this one that I have here 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.019
 with circular movements all over the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.050
 elbow for what we're going to do we're going to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.750
 take half a lemon that you know 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.410
 the lemon is a natural bleach and what 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.410
 we are going to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 go through all our elbow 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.680
 and with circular movements 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 let's delicately spend our 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.159
 pumice for all around 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.159
 our elbow 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 after we've done this for more or 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.360
 minus 5 minutes the second step is 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.720
 make an exfoliating cream to be able to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 whitening the elbows and involves taking 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.470
 a spoonful of sugar and a spoonful 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.470
 of oil 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.240
 is going to form a paste that is applied 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the elbows with circular movements 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.430
 to get that we're going to do this must 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.070
 performed daily and it's very 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.220
 very necessary need to do it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 gently so as not to hurt the skin 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.200
 they must suspend the treatments 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.820
 natural until it improves which is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.190
 delay more or less with a period of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.550
 time to get the results that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.120
 I hope I have used and applied 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.910
 because I did maria as you see me 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 had put a little dark and good 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.320
 since I'm using it, I've been 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.740
 clarified enough for this we can 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.930
 apply the exfoliation to clarify 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.500
 the elbows can also use sugar 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.160
 cornmeal yogurt etcetera now what 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160
 let's do 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.750
 what are we going to do after polishing 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.590
 the pumice stone our elbow have 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.630
 passed for about 5 minutes the lemon that 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.260
 let's do let's apply the dreaded 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.170
 Exfoliating we have created with the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.360
 sugar and olive cream 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.390
 excuse me and olive oil we're going 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.710
 to apply in a circular way leaving it 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.760
 current for about half an hour 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.760
 in this way 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.160
 I find myself a little difficult with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.770
 the camera because good and good what 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.860
 we do on the elbows also serves the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.280
 same procedure for the knees and 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.260
 well it is important to apply after 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.130
 we have done this to withdraw what we are going 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.650
 to do with cold water we remove 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.050
 the exfoliating cream that we have used with 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.410
 cold water and then after we go to 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.690
 apply a moisturizer cream be a 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.450
 body cream that a hand cream 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.490
 that a face cream does not matter if 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.370
 the type of cream that is important 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.920
 make it a moisturizing cream and it will 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.560
 for the function to function as and 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.830
 prevents elbows from getting rougher 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.220
 that this contributes to the thickening of 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.600
 the skin here of those of the elbows 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.920
 because we always support the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.720
 elbows be when we are in the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.550
 computer on the computer when 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.840
 we are at work when we are 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.270
 doing going that you know that 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.150
 we are thus always supported with the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.819
 elbows 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.920
 now after having spent more or 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.810
 less than half an hour of having applied 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.930
 our homemade creampie moisturizes 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.050
 exfoliating that we are going to do we are going to 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.509
 take a wash with cold water and let's 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.520
 dry and then we will apply a 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.590
 any type of cream cream as 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.500
 day or with body cream for the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.270
 face for the hands is enough to be a 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.090
 moisturizing cream me in this case I will 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.680
 use the body cream of the ship and you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.680
 I'm going to pass 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.699
 in the elbow this same process I'm going to 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.240
 make it in the right elbow with the elbow 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.820
 left as you see me and I 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.639
 They have clarified quite a pity that 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.830
 have some pictures of how I had them before 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.569
 on one elbow it looks a little darker 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.360
 that the other one seems because I support more 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:08.349
 one that the other this is the right 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.939
 and this is the left good I wanted them 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.460
 say that this same process we can 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.960
 apply on the knees since you 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.860
 they know that also knees 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.710
 the same effect is done we have the same 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.470
 problem since the skin of the knees 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.630
 it gets a little thicker and also a 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.139
 slightly darker to remove stains 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.620
 we can use the lemon that in this 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.620
 case 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.250
 excuse the interruption is that I 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.170
 they played the good play as I spoke to them 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.020
 of the knees to whiten the 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.390
 knees we can do once or twice a 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.700
 the weeks of making a brief 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.010
 spoliation that we will use to 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.700
 this exfoliation mix we are going to make 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.550
 cornmeal with yogurt a 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.920
 spoonful of sugar one of honey and good 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.220
 we are going to create you create it again 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.090
 bottle where we are going to do the same 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.660
 past process press the pumice stone 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:12.410
 then we pass the lemon and then we go to 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.090
 enter and we will exfoliate with the 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.450
 creampie I told you in these 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.180

 possible remember that lemon juice 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.170
 It is an old natural remedy for 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.950
