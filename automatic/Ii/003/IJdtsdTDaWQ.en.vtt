00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
normal creepers like to spawn during the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
normal creepers like to spawn during the
night<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.579> isn't<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.030> set<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> different

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
night now there isn't a set of different

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.599 
night now there isn't a set of different
type<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> spawn<00:01:01.770> rate<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.160> each<00:01:02.219> type<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
type of spawn rate for each type of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.850 
type of spawn rate for each type of
creeper<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.239> each<00:01:03.600> creeper<00:01:04.049> could<00:01:04.229> spawn<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
creeper so each creeper could spawn at a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
creeper so each creeper could spawn at a
random<00:01:05.100> rates<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.970> seriously<00:01:06.299> hoping<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
random rates I was seriously hoping that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.149 
random rates I was seriously hoping that
the<00:01:06.930> diamond<00:01:07.320> creeper<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> hardest

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the diamond creeper would be the hardest

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
the diamond creeper would be the hardest
one<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> find<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.970> turns<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> first

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
one to find but turns out when I first

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
one to find but turns out when I first
load<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> world<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.710> nighttime<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.610> do
