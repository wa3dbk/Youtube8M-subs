00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.279
 and watson world certainly but today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 we will meet for a tutorial 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.820
 how to make hac zombies on 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 black ops 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 obviously without jailbreak and on the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.759
 last update 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 so it's going to be hac solo but 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.090
 really a very me as you see on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 can have all the weapons one can 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 have the clips go through the town halls 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.830
 ferrand can discover many things 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.720
 so let's go 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.690
 so for a start we will take a 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.790
 other usb key and puts it in the hole of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 right of our ps3 so that can be 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.970
 Any usb key 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 so here we put it in the hole of 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.129
 right and let's go once we have 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 tried the usb key and then we will get 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.250
 find on the ps3 in the game tab 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 you will open data utility 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 saved ps3 and there you will see 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 your blackops save profile you 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.110
 will have it copied and copied on 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.850
 your usb key so by making believe 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.409
 but there you will validate one of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.030
 loading and its good copy completed 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.250
 So here we are on 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.570
 computer 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.810
 so we just forget to take the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.810
 key in the ps3 is the m at the my 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.260
 here's once that's done so 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.200
 once your usb key is put in your 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.020
 computer and with the backup of 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.350
 black ops on it so you go there there 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.760
 are going to be violins in the description 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.590
 these two read winrar so he a lot 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.650
 will also undermine but as one in two 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.270
 opportunities then you go first 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.450
 take the file called model 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 in b2b amazing rare weight so thanks to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.900
 them madison young 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.180
 you will double click on it and there 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.320
 there is going to be a dll s file you auto 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.509
 go put on your desk 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.640
 so we can remember and will be the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.930
 mode file is to the side dishes and this 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.310
 folder where you are going to rename the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 why because there will be one 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.970
 second of the same name it will have to be there 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
 find then I advise you to 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.410
 rename me I called it covered by 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.160
 the wind so I will call it zombies 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.240
 ac here is simply 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.320
 so here we are once we have this 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.140
 ac zombies file 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.620
 you're going to open your usb key so that 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.270
 you put me in your computer 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.310
 and there is going to be a ps3 file then 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.239
 I'm just saying it does not matter if you 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.430
 already have other files on your 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.620

 so baes 0 10 31 self so it's a little 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.530
 it would take him blade on the desk and 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.730

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.730

 snapshot winrar called ps3 save 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.280

 me so if you do not understand I 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.520
 would step in step in the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.750
 description but if you do not understand 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.000
 you are really better because it's 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.050

 normally it's called baylet 0 10 31 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.750
 so that's the thing you extracted 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.940
 reopen 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.810
 here's once this done you're going 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.100
 save to profiles 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.410

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.660
 russell 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.190
 so there's going to be a little 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.200
 10 second change to the pole and 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.419

 go ok so a first message 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.580
 saying that it's good and the second 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.570
 that's once they told you gail 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.810
 brazilian shea 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.150
 you will do ok and there you can 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.600
 close the application and there you go 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.729
 find yourself with three posters and the 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.740
 first called original backup 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.229
 you can put it aside 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.330
 it's not him the second circuit 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.430
 zodiac you put it aside and that's 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 the third is called belvèze 0 10 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.919
 31 auto you will open your usb key 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.680
 and put it back in so he was 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.630
 modified and that's it in fact the granby 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.490
 and in there to touch us nothing 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.190
 can right click and eject your 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.550
 TV 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.870
 and we end up on the ps3 obviously 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:00.120
 in our name on the platform you 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:02.720
 go back to work on evans 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.130
 London 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.930
 now we have reinserted 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.910
 the appeasement we will end up on 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.550
 the fingernail and I give it just now in 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.480
 backed up data utility ps3 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.630
 what if you have selected 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.390
 your usb stick and make triangle on the 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.250
 zombie fashion by high z our essay 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.810
 copy back there they do say sentences and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.880
 sir you will lose yes and yes a 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.590
 small load and his good copy 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.000
 finished so now we're going to get 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.500
 find on black ops so I'm going 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.830
 speed up a little story of not you 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.000
 to keep waiting 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.070
 So here we are on black ops 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.170
 I cut the presentation you go 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.750
 simply go into his beep and then 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.300
 solo and select ayrton kino so 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.800
 the game will launch 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.060
 so I like accelerated so it's going 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.170
 go a little faster than I comment 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.330
 a little delayed but it is not serious 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.530
 there you so to you go as if you 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.240
 are in a normal part and you 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.530
 go start to release the weapons 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.120
 and there you will see all the weapons 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.710
 improved will be on the ground so I 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.240
 picked up the little gun the the gun of 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.780
 thunder of zeus makes a brief I know 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.780
 plus the laser gun etc 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.820
 then the orders that is to say kind 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.320
 a wall pass mode a roots etc 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.370
 are done with the triggers but I 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.140
 would put the list of all the 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.420
 commands in description 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.740
 then you see that we can 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.680
 can really go anywhere you 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.120
 can visit the map we can discover 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.470
 some unknown places 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.360
 we did not know about this map 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.800
 do not adhere totten so it's really 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.690
 rather funny look there I'm in
