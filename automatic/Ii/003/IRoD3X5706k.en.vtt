00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.630 
actually adds three insurance and for
cunning<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.410> create<00:02:22.590> two<00:02:23.010> blaster

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
cunning you can create two blaster

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.250 
cunning you can create two blaster
pistols<00:02:24.090> both<00:02:25.080> varying<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.830> stats<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:27.750> blaster

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
Molly weapons so arm steak is also good

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.840 
Molly weapons so arm steak is also good
if<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> Mallee<00:02:37.500> spect<00:02:38.010> character<00:02:38.550> and

if you are a Mallee spect character and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.310 
if you are a Mallee spect character and
of<00:02:39.600> course<00:02:39.870> your<00:02:40.080> sniper<00:02:40.590> rifle<00:02:41.450> now<00:02:42.450> also

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
of course your sniper rifle now also

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.670 
of course your sniper rifle now also
when<00:02:43.560> creating<00:02:43.860> gear<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.840> actually<00:02:46.080> cure

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
when creating gear you can actually cure

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.789 
when creating gear you can actually cure
it<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:47.610> character<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.959> down<00:02:49.500> here

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
it up for your character so down here

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.830 
it up for your character so down here
i'm<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.280> queue<00:02:50.519> up<00:02:50.549> him<00:02:50.910> crafting<00:02:51.600> some

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
i'm going to queue up him crafting some

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.150 
i'm going to queue up him crafting some
barrels<00:02:52.290> oh<00:02:52.709> god<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.269> knew<00:02:54.959> sir

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.410 

so<00:02:58.850> as<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.390> see<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.840> can<00:02:59.870> actually<00:03:00.170> crew

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
so as you can see you can actually crew

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.690 
so as you can see you can actually crew
queue<00:03:02.420> up<00:03:02.660> five<00:03:03.020> things<00:03:03.350> at<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.560> time<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.550> is

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
queue up five things at a time this is

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.280 
queue up five things at a time this is
also<00:03:04.880> particularly<00:03:05.420> good<00:03:05.750> when<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.170> are

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
also particularly good when you are

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.560 
also particularly good when you are
logging<00:03:06.500> out<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.100> going<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.490> sleep<00:03:07.730> because

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
logging out and going to sleep because

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.810 
logging out and going to sleep because
in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> later<00:03:09.020> stages<00:03:09.140> some<00:03:09.860> stuff<00:03:10.190> does<00:03:10.490> take

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
in the later stages some stuff does take

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.630 
in the later stages some stuff does take
hours<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.330> craft<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.830> could<00:03:13.190> queue<00:03:13.490> up

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
hours to craft so you could queue up

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.700 
hours to craft so you could queue up
five<00:03:13.970> things<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.630> let<00:03:14.780> him<00:03:14.960> craft<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.500> not

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
five things and let him craft or not

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.590 
five things and let him craft or not
while<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.250> are<00:03:16.280> actually<00:03:16.640> sleeping<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.420> come

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
while you are actually sleeping and come

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.050 
while you are actually sleeping and come
back<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.020> morning<00:03:18.290> every<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.010> rewards

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.100 

now<00:03:23.060> I'm<00:03:23.210> going<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.480> skip<00:03:23.660> ahead<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:24.020> this

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
now I'm going to skip ahead in this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.960 
now I'm going to skip ahead in this
video<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.770> until<00:03:25.160> he's<00:03:25.310> finished<00:03:25.520> creating

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
video just until he's finished creating

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.520 
video just until he's finished creating
these<00:03:26.420> five<00:03:26.810> barrels<00:03:28.600> okay<00:03:29.600> now<00:03:30.110> he's<00:03:30.350> almost

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
these five barrels okay now he's almost

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.200 
these five barrels okay now he's almost
finished<00:03:30.830> creating<00:03:31.070> these<00:03:31.370> five<00:03:31.640> barrels<00:03:31.910> as

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
finished creating these five barrels as

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.910 
finished creating these five barrels as
you<00:03:32.300> can<00:03:32.390> see<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.600> have<00:03:32.720> five<00:03:33.140> seconds<00:03:33.590> left<00:03:33.800> on

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
you can see I have five seconds left on

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.070 
you can see I have five seconds left on
my<00:03:34.070> last<00:03:34.280> barrel<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.940> went<00:03:35.600> ahead<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.930> created

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
my last barrel I went ahead and created

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.230 
my last barrel I went ahead and created
in<00:03:36.410> number<00:03:36.710> two<00:03:36.890> barrels<00:03:37.340> just<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:37.940> have

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
in number two barrels just so I have

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.790 
in number two barrels just so I have
some<00:03:38.510> stuff<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.810> show<00:03:38.990> you<00:03:39.170> for<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.500> next

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
some stuff to show you for this next

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.030 
some stuff to show you for this next
step<00:03:40.130> now<00:03:43.780> all<00:03:44.780> your<00:03:44.990> crafted<00:03:45.500> items<00:03:45.590> which

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
step now all your crafted items which

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.470 
step now all your crafted items which
you<00:03:46.190> can<00:03:46.310> see<00:03:46.340> here

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.750 

you<00:03:53.480> when<00:03:54.110> leveling<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:55.129> best<00:03:55.340> part<00:03:55.549> about<00:03:55.610> it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
you when leveling the best part about it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.820 
you when leveling the best part about it
is<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.599> will<00:03:56.720> create<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.080> whole<00:03:57.290> heap<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.560> one

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
is you will create a whole heap of one

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.759 
is you will create a whole heap of one
item<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.819> level<00:03:59.090> your<00:03:59.120> spec<00:03:59.569> but<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.500> can

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
item just to level your spec but you can

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.070 
item just to level your spec but you can

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.129 
and give you give you some of your stuff
that<00:04:22.669> you've<00:04:22.820> actually<00:04:23.120> used<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.630> craft<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
that you've actually used to craft the

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.740 
that you've actually used to craft the
item<00:04:24.410> but<00:04:25.190> will<00:04:25.400> also<00:04:25.430> give<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.970> chance<00:04:26.300> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
item but will also give you a chance to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.219 
item but will also give you a chance to
learn<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.590> new<00:04:27.800> schematic<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:28.760> if<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.229> reverse

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
learn a new schematic so if I reverse

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.189 
learn a new schematic so if I reverse
engineer<00:04:30.710> these<00:04:30.919> seven<00:04:31.400> scopes<00:04:31.990> hopefully<00:04:32.990> I

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
engineer these seven scopes hopefully I

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.500 
engineer these seven scopes hopefully I
will<00:04:33.650> get<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.039> new<00:04:34.370> schematic<00:04:34.880> for<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> blue

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
will get a new schematic for a blue

00:04:35.510 --> 00:05:18.590 
will get a new schematic for a blue
scope

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.660 

unlucky<00:05:19.600> didn't<00:05:20.500> actually<00:05:20.590> receive<00:05:21.070> any<00:05:21.310> new

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.580 
down and right click and I will scavenge
myself<00:06:03.940> so<00:06:04.630> I'm<00:06:04.690> going<00:06:04.810> ahead<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.140> send<00:06:05.470> him

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
myself so I'm going ahead and send him

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.140 
myself so I'm going ahead and send him
over<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.920> scabbard<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:08.880> that's<00:06:09.880> basically

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
over the scabbard and that's basically

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.540 
over the scabbard and that's basically
it<00:06:10.510> that's<00:06:10.990> how<00:06:11.230> simple<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.740> is<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.890> scavenge

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
it that's how simple it is to scavenge

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.360 
it that's how simple it is to scavenge
so<00:06:13.390> as<00:06:13.600> I<00:06:13.750> run<00:06:13.930> around<00:06:14.200> and<00:06:14.350> destroy<00:06:14.770> droids<00:06:15.190> i

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
so as I run around and destroy droids i

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.550 
so as I run around and destroy droids i
cants<00:06:15.670> cabbage<00:06:16.090> than<00:06:16.390> the<00:06:16.570> precious

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
cants cabbage than the precious

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.880 
cants cabbage than the precious
materials<00:06:18.130> and<00:06:18.570> that<00:06:19.570> basically<00:06:19.840> sums<00:06:20.410> up<00:06:20.650> arm

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
materials and that basically sums up arm

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.190 
materials and that basically sums up arm
to<00:06:21.100> arm<00:06:21.460> stick<00:06:21.840> basically<00:06:22.840> all<00:06:22.870> your

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
to arm stick basically all your

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.310 
to arm stick basically all your
companions<00:06:23.740> your<00:06:24.490> arm<00:06:24.790> other<00:06:25.600> trade<00:06:26.080> skills

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
companions your arm other trade skills

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:36.560 
companions your arm other trade skills
will<00:06:26.590> be<00:06:26.620> very<00:06:27.040> similar

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.020 

actually<00:06:37.570> I'm<00:06:37.750> log<00:06:37.990> epic<00:06:38.770> and<00:06:39.280> very<00:06:39.610> rare

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
actually I'm log epic and very rare

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.460 
actually I'm log epic and very rare
patterns<00:06:40.720> from<00:06:40.990> doing<00:06:41.230> so<00:06:45.960> that<00:06:46.960> concludes<00:06:47.170> my
