now<00:02:07.159> this<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.239> certainly<00:02:08.840> looking<00:02:09.410> like<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
now this is certainly looking like a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
now this is certainly looking like a
normal<00:02:09.739> member<00:02:10.580> with<00:02:11.920> touch<00:02:12.920> interface
