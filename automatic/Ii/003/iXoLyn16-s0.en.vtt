Oort cloud which is where comets come
from<00:01:09.799> that's<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.010> scientists<00:01:11.520> say<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
from that's what scientists say this is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:17.700 
from that's what scientists say this is
a<00:01:17.040> No

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
a No

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.050 
a No
of<00:01:18.100> what<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.610> courts<00:01:19.299> cloud<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:20.140> like<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.729> Sun

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
of what the courts cloud is like the Sun

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.040 
of what the courts cloud is like the Sun
is<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.630> star<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:27.040> is<00:01:27.100> not<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.610> very<00:01:27.909> big<00:01:28.270> star<00:01:28.630> and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
is a star it is not a very big star and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:41.249 
is a star it is not a very big star and
it<00:01:29.800> is<00:01:29.979> not<00:01:30.159> very<00:01:30.430> small<00:01:30.790> either<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.720> closest

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
it is not very small either the closest

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:49.669 
it is not very small either the closest
star<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.640> Sun<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.420> called<00:01:43.899> Alpha<00:01:44.320> Centauri

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.109 

but<00:01:50.679> actually<00:01:51.220> Alpha<00:01:51.759> Centauri<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.570> 3<00:01:53.410> stars<00:01:54.119> -

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
but actually Alpha Centauri is 3 stars -

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.710 
but actually Alpha Centauri is 3 stars -
are<00:01:55.600> as<00:01:55.929> big<00:01:56.289> as<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.800> Sun<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.580> one<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.240> small

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
are as big as the Sun and one is small

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.529 
are as big as the Sun and one is small
so<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.080> Alpha<00:02:02.530> Centauri<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.539> Alpha

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
so this is Alpha Centauri a Alpha

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:12.210 
so this is Alpha Centauri a Alpha
Centauri<00:02:04.720> B<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:06.090> Proxima<00:02:07.090> Centauri<00:02:11.220> stars

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
Centauri B and Proxima Centauri stars

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.600 
Centauri B and Proxima Centauri stars
come<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.910> many<00:02:13.209> different<00:02:13.300> sizes<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.920> Sun<00:02:15.190> is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
come in many different sizes the Sun is

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.300 
come in many different sizes the Sun is
small<00:02:16.209> compared<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.019> Sirius<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.100> Arcturus<00:02:20.310> so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
small compared to Sirius and Arcturus so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.640 
small compared to Sirius and Arcturus so
here<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.670> serious<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.989> big<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.530> is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
here is serious and this big one is

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.430 
here is serious and this big one is
Arcturus<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.880> or<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.079> Sun<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:28.440> our

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
Arcturus this or here is the Sun and our

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.090 
Arcturus this or here is the Sun and our
Sun<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:30.010> very<00:02:30.880> tiny<00:02:31.390> compared<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.560> biggest

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
Sun is very tiny compared to the biggest

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.440 
Sun is very tiny compared to the biggest
stars<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:34.600> Betelgeuse<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.730> Antares<00:02:39.450> here's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
stars like Betelgeuse and Antares here's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.449 
stars like Betelgeuse and Antares here's
the<00:02:40.720> Sun<00:02:40.959> which<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.739> tiny<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.280> can

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the Sun which is so tiny you can

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.990 
the Sun which is so tiny you can
basically<00:02:43.209> not<00:02:43.690> see<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:45.459> here's<00:02:45.730> beta

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
basically not see it and here's beta

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.590 
basically not see it and here's beta
Jews<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.510> Antares<00:02:47.079> which<00:02:47.320> are<00:02:47.880> supergiant

stars

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.330 
stars
come<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.740> different<00:02:53.980> colors<00:02:56.940> red<00:02:57.940> equals<00:02:58.600> cool

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
come in different colors red equals cool

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.260 
come in different colors red equals cool
yellow<00:03:00.340> equals<00:03:00.640> medium<00:03:01.620> blue<00:03:02.730> equals<00:03:03.730> hot

yellow equals medium blue equals hot

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.750 
yellow equals medium blue equals hot
sometimes<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.960> star's<00:03:08.260> come<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.010> pairs<00:03:09.400> or

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
sometimes a star's come in pairs or

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.330 
sometimes a star's come in pairs or
trios<00:03:10.860> they<00:03:11.860> are<00:03:12.040> binary<00:03:12.550> stars<00:03:14.190> there's<00:03:15.190> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
trios they are binary stars there's a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.090 
trios they are binary stars there's a
notion<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.420> what<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> binary<00:03:17.020> star<00:03:17.560> might<00:03:17.920> look

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
notion of what a binary star might look

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.610 
notion of what a binary star might look
like<00:03:18.160> up<00:03:19.000> close<00:03:21.000> when<00:03:22.000> stars<00:03:22.390> get<00:03:22.780> very<00:03:23.290> old

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
like up close when stars get very old

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.110 
like up close when stars get very old
they<00:03:24.190> get<00:03:24.370> smaller<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.320> brown<00:03:26.320> dwarf<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.400> very

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
they get smaller a brown dwarf is a very

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.420 
they get smaller a brown dwarf is a very
small<00:03:28.720> cool<00:03:29.500> star<00:03:31.770> this<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.950> what<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.160> brown

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
small cool star this is what a brown

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.760 
small cool star this is what a brown
dwarf<00:03:33.730> might<00:03:34.150> look<00:03:34.330> like<00:03:34.390> from<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.200> planet

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
dwarf might look like from a planet

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.280 
dwarf might look like from a planet
orbiting<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:39.000> white<00:03:40.000> dwarf<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:40.720> another<00:03:41.020> kind

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
orbiting a white dwarf is another kind

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.240 
orbiting a white dwarf is another kind
of<00:03:41.500> very<00:03:41.980> small<00:03:42.460> cool<00:03:43.030> star<00:03:46.560> when<00:03:47.560> some<00:03:47.890> stars

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
of very small cool star when some stars

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.600 
of very small cool star when some stars
get<00:03:48.640> old<00:03:48.850> they<00:03:49.660> blow<00:03:50.350> up

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:04.670 

they<00:03:54.480> become<00:03:54.840> supernovas<00:03:57.710> here<00:03:58.710> it<00:03:58.800> goes<00:04:00.560> boom

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.750 

a<00:04:04.939> supernova<00:04:05.939> leaves<00:04:06.510> behind<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.290> nebula<00:04:08.219> like
