00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 international belgian rally championship 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.920
 why robert droogmans only veerdonk and who if necessary the belgian ambassadors 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.599
 for the maasboulevard rescue plan blokhuijsen second in the ranking on 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.070
 seven points of upset 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.419
 the report proves 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.109
 that the entire team is not competitive 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.550
 and outclass as an opponent 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.519
 and that are his own famous names 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.499
 mcqueen according to touring 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.099
 the film 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.710
 rats full 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.879
 nevertheless you have to roll this is what all classification runs 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 No 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
 the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 now the nicest part in the joy is that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.240
 could walk afterwards 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 they were third 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 the triumphal march of the role of skating 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.670
 for the last round, percent is one minute ahead of sneakers 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.520
 that actually nothing more happened 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.870
 and we ask the village man how it is 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.340
 that such a fast pilot won less than 3 10 81 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.940
 the open 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.910
 a much smaller one is awaiting 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 that was that he can also do the subsequent sprint i got in 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.140
 part-time work 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.810
 I'm sure that will be worth a party 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.620
 so I force him to true love it seems that he 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.730
 and wk against australia 4 0 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.040
 why 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.210
 I said I experience it myself before 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260
 so it is always obvious that I am cracking proposals 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.830
 the stage was spared would remain this will most likely be others 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.519
 because 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.519
 thereby 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.389
 how to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.959
 the 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.239
 but we can't do anything better 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.409
 and sometimes dramatic 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.449
 with three special stages to go in the last round the first for the 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.359
 suspension of the ice club 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.249
 once again his tears can hardly contain 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.909
 sleds crashed into the lap 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.840
 and fourth place can be Brockmans Panther movies
