three<00:01:17.070> editors<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.659> just<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.869> two<00:01:18.990> different

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

complications<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.490> get

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
complications I don't really want to get
into<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.299> our<00:01:21.900> main<00:01:22.080> editor

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
into it but I think our main editor

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.330 
into it but I think our main editor
right<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> dying

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
gonna be a really long montage and it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670
