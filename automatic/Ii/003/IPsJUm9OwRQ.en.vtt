00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hyundai Hoch Restaurant 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.490
 brewery opened in Kolpino 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 brewed live beer that has not been subjected 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.200
 heat treatment 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 retained all the nutrients and in 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.800
 including yeast cells is complicated 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.240
 drink at night and it really requires 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.240
 hard and hard work 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.859
 there are generally two types in the world 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.530
 expressions for the production of beer where 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.860
 top fermentation yeast and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.700
 bottom fermentation we use german 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.160
 technology 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.070
 bottom fermentation restaurant hammerfall 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.230
 We follow all German traditions 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.020
 brewing production for 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.480
 cooking light beer we 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.480
 use light German malt 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.820
 for making dark beer we 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.629
 use several varieties of caramel 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 malt and plus female malt for giving 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.990
 dark color and specific bitterness and 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.659
 this is not sediment this is an extract which 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.659
 coming out of the malt 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.590
 begins with the grinding of malt 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.220
 we mix it with water that is 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.119
 cooked but then goes 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.720
 infusion 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.830
 the mash then pumps the mash on 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.460
 filter chan jubilation mash we 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.250
 occurs naturally through the layer 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.619
 we filter the malt and for whom we boil 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.619
 the filtered essence is grounded now we 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 we take either German or I am Czech 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 depending on the beer 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.600
 temporarily boiling the wort sawed down cape 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.920
 hour and a half then settles for 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 30 minutes and pumped 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 right tank 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.489
 and after the main fermentation during 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.420
 somewhere of the week 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.849
 then we saw good wishes and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.510
 ripens within months and only 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.510
 after that we develop and sit in the barrel 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.569
 now and alcohol due to what is formed 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.069
 here they ferment the yeast 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.959
 sugars and turn them alcohol and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.849
 carbon dioxide what does it go there carbonated 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.829
 in the same not boring carbonate 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.909
 natural fermentation process at 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.870
 which is the saturation 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.870
 carbon dioxide 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.910
 if she choose and in vivo 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.840
 conditions there are very many useful 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.700
 substances and vitamins and trace elements 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.780
 if she was given to ripen for 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.260
 month or two 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.980
 she has a milder taste and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.980
 pleasant aroma 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.750
 restaurant beer you hand hoh 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.670
 we adhere to all German traditions 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.830
 so that you can appreciate you 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.830
 need to take and try our beer
