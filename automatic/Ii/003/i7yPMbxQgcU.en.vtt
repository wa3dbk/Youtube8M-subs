here's<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.109> quick<00:00:04.439> tutorial<00:00:04.620> on<00:00:05.069> bread<00:00:05.370> pudding

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
here's a quick tutorial on bread pudding

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.100 
here's a quick tutorial on bread pudding
basically<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> breadboard<00:00:07.890> allows<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.459> to

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
basically a breadboard allows you to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.709 
basically a breadboard allows you to
connect<00:00:10.219> circuitry<00:00:11.219> very<00:00:11.820> easily<00:00:12.059> very

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
connect circuitry very easily very

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.220 
connect circuitry very easily very
quickly<00:00:12.809> without<00:00:13.440> soldering<00:00:14.809> for<00:00:15.809> example<00:00:16.139> on

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
quickly without soldering for example on

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.800 
quickly without soldering for example on
a<00:00:16.259> breadboard<00:00:16.650> each<00:00:17.610> row<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.090> connected

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
a breadboard each row is connected

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.749 
a breadboard each row is connected
together<00:00:19.310> independently<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.399> each<00:00:20.520> other

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
together independently of each other

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.999 
together independently of each other
this<00:00:21.029> way<00:00:21.239> but<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:22.290> way<00:00:22.529> they're<00:00:22.890> all

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
this way but this way they're all

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.359 
this way but this way they're all
connected<00:00:24.800> generally<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.919> want<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.099> run<00:00:26.250> your

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
connected generally you want to run your

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.900 
connected generally you want to run your
power<00:00:26.579> here<00:00:27.059> in<00:00:27.210> your<00:00:28.050> ground<00:00:28.469> here<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
power here in your ground here and I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.729 
power here in your ground here and I
connect<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:30.360> two<00:00:30.540> with<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.750> wires<00:00:31.169> so<00:00:31.469> I<00:00:31.500> can

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
connect the two with just wires so I can

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.520 
connect the two with just wires so I can
get<00:00:31.919> ground<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.399> power<00:00:32.790> from<00:00:33.120> either<00:00:33.149> side<00:00:33.530> now

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
get ground or power from either side now

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
get ground or power from either side now
you<00:00:34.620> can't<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.129> one<00:00:35.329> if<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.660> go

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you can't see on this one if I just go

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.720 
you can't see on this one if I just go
back<00:00:36.929> a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.679> of<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.219> have

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
back a little bit you kind of see I have

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
back a little bit you kind of see I have
potentiometers<00:00:41.730> mounted<00:00:42.449> on<00:00:42.539> here<00:00:42.839> with

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
potentiometers mounted on here with

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.840 
potentiometers mounted on here with
wires<00:00:43.559> attached<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.359> allow<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.839> to

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
wires attached that will allow me to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
wires attached that will allow me to
actually<00:00:47.850> connect<00:00:48.179> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.260> potentiometers

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually connect you know potentiometers

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
actually connect you know potentiometers
which<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.429> what<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> put<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> knob<00:00:50.999> on<00:00:52.010> for<00:00:53.010> this

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
which is what you put a knob on for this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.000 
which is what you put a knob on for this
basic<00:00:53.399> circuit<00:00:53.999> it's<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> basic<00:00:55.010> clipping

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
basic circuit it's just a basic clipping

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.169 
basic circuit it's just a basic clipping
circuit<00:00:56.429> and<00:00:57.800> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:02.309> inputs

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
circuit and as you can see the inputs

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.630 
circuit and as you can see the inputs
here<00:01:03.269> so<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> sound<00:01:04.110> enters<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.640> goes

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
here so the sound enters here goes

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.140 
here so the sound enters here goes
through<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> capacitor<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:08.400> helps<00:01:08.910> bias

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
through a capacitor and this helps bias

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.290 
through a capacitor and this helps bias
it<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.070> resistor<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:12.000> equal

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
it this is we get one resistor two equal

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.620 
it this is we get one resistor two equal
resistors<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.620> power<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> one

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
resistors one from power go into it one

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.080 
resistors one from power go into it one
from<00:01:15.810> ground<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.580> divides<00:01:17.910> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
from ground go into it that divides the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
from ground go into it that divides the
voltage<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.930> half<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.440> resistor

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
voltage in half and with this resistor

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
voltage in half and with this resistor
helps<00:01:23.100> biasing<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> network<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:27.440> forms

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
helps biasing this network here forms

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.190 
helps biasing this network here forms
the<00:01:28.590> game<00:01:28.800> so<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the game so this right here with the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
the game so this right here with the
arrow<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> potentiometer<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.330> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
arrow is a potentiometer like a like a

arrow is a potentiometer like a like a
variable<00:01:33.750> resistor<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:36.950> along<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:37.980> this

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
variable resistor and along with this

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.860 
variable resistor and along with this
resistor<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.090> capacitor<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.750> ground<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:42.030> we

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
resistor and capacitor to ground that we

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.860 
resistor and capacitor to ground that we
can<00:01:42.900> control<00:01:43.350> gain<00:01:43.650> there<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.580> we<00:01:45.510> can<00:01:45.630> also

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
can control gain there and we can also

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.070 
can control gain there and we can also
put<00:01:46.500> diodes<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> between<00:01:47.850> each<00:01:48.180> going

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
put diodes here in between each going

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.890 
put diodes here in between each going
opposite<00:01:49.500> ways<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.040> between<00:01:50.340> each<00:01:50.900> line

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
opposite ways but between each line

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.300 
opposite ways but between each line
there<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:54.080> forms<00:01:55.080> soft<00:01:55.320> clipping<00:01:55.620> or<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
there that forms soft clipping or we

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.000 
there that forms soft clipping or we
could<00:01:56.430> take<00:01:56.640> diodes<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.720> ground<00:01:58.080> here<00:01:58.650> going

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
could take diodes to ground here going

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.980 
could take diodes to ground here going
opposite<00:01:59.340> ways<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.480> forms<00:02:00.810> hard

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
opposite ways and that forms hard

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.140 
opposite ways and that forms hard
clipping<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.550> here<00:02:02.730> is<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.940> volume

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
clipping this right here is the volume

op-amp<00:02:35.370> I'm<00:02:35.459> using<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.660> single<00:02:36.989> op

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
op-amp I'm using so it was a single op

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.559 
op-amp I'm using so it was a single op
amp<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.349> pin<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.920> different<00:02:38.390> but<00:02:39.390> it

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
amp the pin out and be different but it

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.580 
amp the pin out and be different but it
still<00:02:39.870> works<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> same<00:02:41.959> these<00:02:42.959> wires<00:02:43.230> here

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
still works the same these wires here

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.229 
still works the same these wires here
just<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.980> back<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.549> point<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:45.150> I

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
just go back to this point here where I

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.729 
just go back to this point here where I
can<00:02:45.390> add<00:02:45.569> diodes<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.170> little<00:02:46.380> more<00:02:46.530> easily

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
can add diodes a little more easily

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.430 
can add diodes a little more easily
basically<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:48.060> jump<00:02:48.480> ring<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> different

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
basically just jump ring to a different

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
basically just jump ring to a different
channel<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.579> more<00:02:50.760> holes<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.299> you

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
channel so I can have more holes to you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.680 
channel so I can have more holes to you
to<00:02:51.540> work<00:02:51.660> from<00:02:52.760> okay<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.790> my<00:02:54.120> power<00:02:54.390> comes<00:02:54.599> in

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to work from okay so my power comes in

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.509 
to work from okay so my power comes in
here<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.280> here's<00:02:56.880> my<00:02:57.000> feedback<00:02:58.040> part<00:02:59.040> my<00:02:59.129> gain

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
here and here's my feedback part my gain

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.240 
here and here's my feedback part my gain
so<00:03:00.450> there's<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.690> resistor<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.890> put<00:03:02.129> this

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so there's a resistor and put this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.660 
so there's a resistor and put this
resistor<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.150> ground

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.920 

so<00:07:09.570> hard<00:07:09.750> clipping<00:07:10.140> generally<00:07:10.500> is<00:07:10.650> used<00:07:11.310> for

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
so hard clipping generally is used for

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.930 
so hard clipping generally is used for
distortion<00:07:12.930> circuits<00:07:13.460> soft<00:07:14.460> clipping<00:07:14.820> is

distortion circuits soft clipping is

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.000 
distortion circuits soft clipping is
usually<00:07:15.210> use<00:07:15.390> for<00:07:15.420> overdrive<00:07:15.930> circuits<00:07:16.380> not
