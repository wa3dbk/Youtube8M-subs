00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
I first bought these I thought these

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.760 
I first bought these I thought these
were<00:05:09.960> going<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.169> be<00:05:10.229> made<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.410> metal<00:05:10.590> or

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
were going to be made of metal or

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.380 
were going to be made of metal or
something<00:05:10.919> cool<00:05:11.310> but<00:05:11.970> now<00:05:12.060> it's<00:05:12.180> made<00:05:12.300> of

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
something cool but now it's made of

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.540 
something cool but now it's made of
plastic<00:05:12.870> oh<00:05:13.080> that's<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.800> little<00:05:13.979> rubber<00:05:14.310> end

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
plastic oh that's a little rubber end

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.040 
plastic oh that's a little rubber end
right<00:05:14.700> there<00:05:14.729> i<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.060> pick<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.840> move

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
right there i can pick and you can move

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.980 
right there i can pick and you can move
and<00:05:19.289> stuff<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:20.419> think<00:05:21.419> that's<00:05:21.570> cool<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:21.870> then

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
and stuff I think that's cool and then

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.750 
and stuff I think that's cool and then
attaches<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.650> court<00:05:22.919> if<00:05:23.160> this<00:05:23.460> for<00:05:23.669> the

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
attaches to the court if this for the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
attaches to the court if this for the
break<00:05:23.970> anywhere<00:05:24.270> i<00:05:24.300> think<00:05:24.479> would<00:05:24.539> break

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
break anywhere i think would break

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.490 
break anywhere i think would break
through<00:05:24.930> there<00:05:25.169> or<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:27.740> or<00:05:28.740> at<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.430> El<00:05:29.520> joint

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
through there or the or at the El joint

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.719 
through there or the or at the El joint
does<00:05:31.500> little<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> place<00:05:32.220> I<00:05:32.340> think<00:05:32.370> they<00:05:32.610> would

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
does little to place I think they would

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.409 
does little to place I think they would
break<00:05:33.000> um<00:05:34.340> at<00:05:35.340> first<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.910> thought<00:05:36.210> they<00:05:36.270> were

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
break um at first I thought they were

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.879 
break um at first I thought they were
going<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.690> go<00:05:36.750> really<00:05:36.930> far<00:05:37.169> on<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.350> mayor<00:05:37.530> but

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
going to go really far on the mayor but

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.850 
going to go really far on the mayor but
they<00:05:37.979> only<00:05:38.070> go<00:05:38.310> up<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:39.720> there<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.590> they're<00:05:40.740> kind

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
they only go up to there so they're kind

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.129 
they only go up to there so they're kind
of<00:05:40.979> heavy<00:05:41.100> because<00:05:41.460> they<00:05:41.639> hang<00:05:41.789> out<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:41.940> lot<00:05:42.139> but

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
of heavy because they hang out a lot but

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.010 
of heavy because they hang out a lot but
if<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.889> use<00:05:43.950> proper<00:05:44.520> your<00:05:44.639> tips<00:05:44.880> they<00:05:45.840> don't

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
if you use proper your tips they don't

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.700 
if you use proper your tips they don't
fall<00:05:46.530> out

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
fall out

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.940 
fall out
I<00:05:48.240> tried<00:05:49.240> foam<00:05:49.870> ear<00:05:50.020> tips<00:05:50.290> of<00:05:50.470> these<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:50.860> it

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
I tried foam ear tips of these and it

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.090 
I tried foam ear tips of these and it
was<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.130> same<00:05:51.160> sound<00:05:51.610> quality<00:05:52.060> same<00:05:53.100> lacking

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
was the same sound quality same lacking

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.910 
was the same sound quality same lacking
so<00:05:54.640> that<00:05:54.790> didn't<00:05:55.030> really<00:05:55.120> make<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.330> difference

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
so that didn't really make a difference

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.820 
so that didn't really make a difference
however<00:05:56.920> on<00:05:57.850> I'm<00:05:58.210> not<00:05:58.690> however<00:05:58.840> but<00:05:59.350> a<00:05:59.500> great

however on I'm not however but a great

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.680 
however on I'm not however but a great

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
alternative to these would just be the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.160 
alternative to these would just be the
