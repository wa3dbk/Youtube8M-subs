00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
so we have we have our work down there

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.530 
so we have we have our work down there
about<00:00:05.960> 78<00:00:06.960> 39<00:00:07.440> degrees<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> Rack

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
about 78 39 degrees we're going to Rack

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230 
about 78 39 degrees we're going to Rack
it<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.260> foot<00:00:10.530> nine<00:00:10.710> canal<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:12.030> I

back two to three hours of those this so
will<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> let<00:01:19.950> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
will you do now I'm going to let this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.620 
will you do now I'm going to let this
just<00:01:20.689> rapping<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> hear<00:01:28.130> we've<00:01:29.130> finished

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
just rapping to hear we've finished

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.109 
just rapping to hear we've finished
racking<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.650> kettle<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> fermenter

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
racking from the kettle to the fermenter

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.280 
racking from the kettle to the fermenter
if<00:01:33.329> you've<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.869> less<00:01:34.049> than<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
if you've got a little bit less than I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
if you've got a little bit less than I
thought<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> would<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.759> probably<00:01:35.880> about<00:01:36.090> four

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
thought I would it's probably about four

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
thought I would it's probably about four
and<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> half<00:01:36.570> gallons<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.430> tiny<00:01:38.430> bit

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and a half gallons in there tiny bit

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.899 
and a half gallons in there tiny bit
more<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.369> last<00:01:41.520> thing<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.729> need<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
more and the one last thing we need to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350 
more and the one last thing we need to
do<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.299> take<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.020> gravity<00:01:43.710> measurement<00:01:44.360> find

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
do is take a gravity measurement find

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
do is take a gravity measurement find
out<00:01:45.509> what's<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.110> specific<00:01:46.770> gravity<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
out what's the specific gravity the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.999 
out what's the specific gravity the
original<00:01:47.610> gravy<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> start<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> do

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
original gravy is going to start so do

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.749 
original gravy is going to start so do
that<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.649> work<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that your for some of the work into a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
that your for some of the work into a
container<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:55.710> put<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:58.070> tool<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.340> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
container and you put your tool in and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.859 
container and you put your tool in and
just<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> above<00:02:00.990> off<00:02:02.869> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
just going to get all the above off and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
just going to get all the above off and
once<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.469> spinning<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> go<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
once it's not spinning you can go up and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.309 
once it's not spinning you can go up and
see<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.020> actual<00:02:07.409> gravity<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.129> now

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
see what the actual gravity is right now

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
see what the actual gravity is right now
we<00:02:10.319> are<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:11.129> at

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
we are right at

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.460 
we are right at
if<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:13.830> about<00:02:14.010> 60<00:02:15.470> so

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
if you can see that right at about 60 so

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.970 
if you can see that right at about 60 so
1060<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.310> our<00:02:17.520> starting<00:02:18.060> gravity<00:02:18.770> which<00:02:19.770> give

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
1060 is our starting gravity which give

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
1060 is our starting gravity which give
us<00:02:20.010> approximately<00:02:20.430> over<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.270> seven<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
us approximately over about seven and a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.790 
us approximately over about seven and a
half<00:02:21.840> about<00:02:22.380> 77<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> half<00:02:23.459> percent<00:02:23.730> alcohol<00:02:23.849> um

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
half about 77 a half percent alcohol um

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
half about 77 a half percent alcohol um
so<00:02:25.800> that's<00:02:25.980> good<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.880> winter<00:02:27.150> beer<00:02:27.420> so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so that's good this is a winter beer so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.979 
so that's good this is a winter beer so
dark<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.440> very<00:02:28.830> very<00:02:28.920> sweet<00:02:29.700> word<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
dark be at very very sweet word and the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.559 
dark be at very very sweet word and the
intent<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.800> very<00:02:31.830> helpful<00:02:32.280> holic<00:02:32.670> so

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
intent is to be very helpful holic so

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.780 
intent is to be very helpful holic so
now<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.140> left<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> do<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.950> pitch<00:02:35.610> our

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
now we have left to do is to pitch our

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.130 
now we have left to do is to pitch our
yeast<00:02:36.030> into<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> fermenter<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.930> cover<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> up

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
yeast into the fermenter and cover it up

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.509 
yeast into the fermenter and cover it up
and<00:02:40.380> let<00:02:41.010> er<00:02:41.040> rip<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.970> healthy

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
and let er rip you can see the healthy

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.620 
and let er rip you can see the healthy
head<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.549> air<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.720> top<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.830> word<00:02:47.630> which

head of air on top of the a word which
is<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.959> result<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.860> really<00:02:50.160> writing<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.420> I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
is a result of my really writing it as I

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080 
is a result of my really writing it as I
was<00:02:51.720> pouring<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:52.910> writing<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
was pouring it in and then writing it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.759 
was pouring it in and then writing it
after<00:02:54.420> I'm<00:02:54.600> gonna<00:02:54.750> shake<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.680> bit

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.270 

I've<00:03:48.540> checked<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.959> my<00:03:49.049> work<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> pitching

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
I've checked on my work is a pitching

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.460 
I've checked on my work is a pitching
temperature<00:03:50.639> between<00:03:51.090> 60<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.630> 70<00:03:52.049> for<00:03:52.380> this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
temperature between 60 to 70 for this

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.910 
temperature between 60 to 70 for this
yeast<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:54.720> once<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.290> there<00:03:55.319> just

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
yeast and then once it's in there just

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.509 
yeast and then once it's in there just
give<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> nice<00:03:56.430> good<00:03:56.780> mix<00:03:57.780> up<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.430> little<00:03:59.430> bit

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
give it a nice good mix up a little bit

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.110 
give it a nice good mix up a little bit
of<00:03:59.639> air<00:03:59.850> in<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:01.819> don't<00:04:02.819> know<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.000> can

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
of air in there I don't know if you can

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.030 
of air in there I don't know if you can
hear<00:04:03.269> this<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.410> really<00:04:04.709> getting

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
hear this but it's really getting

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.309 
hear this but it's really getting
sloshed<00:04:05.730> around<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:09.389> actually<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.170> thing

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
sloshed around the actually the thing

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.840 
sloshed around the actually the thing
about<00:04:10.500> these<00:04:10.739> fermenters<00:04:11.130> too<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.609> that

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
about these fermenters too is that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.550 
about these fermenters too is that
they're<00:04:12.269> designed<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.720> have<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> tennis<00:04:13.410> ball

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
they're designed to have a tennis ball

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.559 
they're designed to have a tennis ball
put<00:04:13.829> on<00:04:13.920> bottom<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.280> them<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:15.000> be<00:04:15.090> cocky<00:04:15.299> do

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
put on bottom of them to be cocky do

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.390 
put on bottom of them to be cocky do
this<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.720> little<00:04:15.810> bit<00:04:15.989> better<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:17.100> one's<00:04:17.310> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
this a little bit better this one's a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.279 
this a little bit better this one's a
little<00:04:17.700> bit<00:04:17.910> too<00:04:18.120> full<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.450> really<00:04:18.930> slosh<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
little bit too full to really slosh it

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.349 
little bit too full to really slosh it
around<00:04:19.470> too<00:04:19.829> much<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.640> want<00:04:20.909> to<00:04:20.970> lose<00:04:21.120> any

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
around too much you want to lose any

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.290 
around too much you want to lose any
more<00:04:21.470> work<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:22.740> good<00:04:22.890> actually<00:04:23.610> about<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> half

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
more work so good actually about a half

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.339 
more work so good actually about a half
gallon<00:04:24.690> less<00:04:24.840> than<00:04:25.020> what<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.169> was<00:04:25.289> expecting
