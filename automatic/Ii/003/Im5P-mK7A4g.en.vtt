let's try that pen you can select the
size<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:09.370> you<00:01:10.370> can<00:01:10.520> also<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.210> transparent

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
size and you can also have a transparent

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.630 
size and you can also have a transparent
function<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.740> here<00:01:13.270> let's<00:01:14.270> go<00:01:14.420> with<00:01:14.630> green<00:01:15.640> and

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
function in here let's go with green and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:27.440 
function in here let's go with green and
maybe<00:01:17.510> do<00:01:17.750> some<00:01:17.810> grass<00:01:18.290> or<00:01:18.890> something

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 

as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:28.890> drawing<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.219> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
as you see when you're drawing with this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.999 
as you see when you're drawing with this
phone<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> push<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.479> hard<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
phone if you push down hard then the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
phone if you push down hard then the
phone<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> move<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> don't

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
phone is going to move you don't

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.760 
phone is going to move you don't
actually<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> push<00:01:35.939> down<00:01:36.149> hard<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.780> super

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually have to push down hard or super

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.940 
actually have to push down hard or super
hard<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.070> least<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.289> pretty<00:01:40.530> smooth

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
hard at least I can do it pretty smooth

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.249 
hard at least I can do it pretty smooth
here<00:01:41.340> without<00:01:41.969> having<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> push<00:01:42.719> down<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.350> much

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
here without having to push down so much

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.559 
here without having to push down so much
let's<00:01:46.259> make<00:01:46.679> this<00:01:47.130> sign<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> little<00:01:48.420> bit

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
let's make this sign is a little bit

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:55.550 
let's make this sign is a little bit
smaller<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.299> make<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.780> grass<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
smaller and we can make like grass that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.199 
smaller and we can make like grass that
sticks<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:57.319> compared<00:01:58.319> to<00:01:58.729> something<00:01:59.729> galaxy

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
sticks up compared to something galaxy

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.669 
sticks up compared to something galaxy
note<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.780> see<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.959> this<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.259> has<00:02:01.289> used

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
note you can see that this one has used

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.719 
note you can see that this one has used
this<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.099> basic<00:02:02.580> game<00:02:03.200> soft<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.709> at<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this like basic game soft thing at the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.839 
this like basic game soft thing at the
top<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.599> the<00:02:06.750> Galaxy<00:02:07.709> Note<00:02:07.860> 4<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.190> definitely

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
top here the Galaxy Note 4 is definitely

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
top here the Galaxy Note 4 is definitely
more<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> pen<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.829> one<00:02:10.979> doesn't

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
more like a pen and this one doesn't
