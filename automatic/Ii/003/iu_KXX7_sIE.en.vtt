box should be pretty protected now let's
go<00:01:54.479> ahead<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> open<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.770> size<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
go ahead and open the one from size and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.719 
go ahead and open the one from size and
see<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:58.409> their<00:01:58.680> box<00:01:58.950> looks<00:01:59.250> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
see how what their box looks like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.749 
see how what their box looks like
so<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> bigger<00:02:01.469> plastic<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.520> see

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so it's a bigger plastic as you can see

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.929 
so it's a bigger plastic as you can see
it's<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.270> tightly<00:02:04.159> fitted<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.670> on

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it's not as tightly fitted as it was on

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.660 
it's not as tightly fitted as it was on
the<00:02:05.969> end<00:02:06.240> box<00:02:06.590> again<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.740> ahead<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.250> computer

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the end box again go ahead this computer

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.350 
the end box again go ahead this computer
open<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.300> real<00:02:09.569> quick<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:11.209> let's<00:02:12.209> just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
open this up real quick and let's just

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.979 
open this up real quick and let's just
go<00:02:12.510> ahead<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.170> off<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.810> can

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
go ahead and get that off and we can

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.460 
go ahead and get that off and we can
immediately<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.160> size<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.599> using<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
immediately see that size is using a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890 
immediately see that size is using a
cheaper<00:02:23.459> type<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.910> box<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> box<00:02:24.780> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
cheaper type of box so the box is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
cheaper type of box so the box is
already<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> mean<00:02:25.860> kind<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> coming<00:02:26.549> apart

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
already like I mean kind of coming apart

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.530 
already like I mean kind of coming apart
but<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> box<00:02:29.000> look<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.299> right
