00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello how about friends scheffer telsen 24 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:11.430
 in this video now I will show you the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.519
 connection of the speakers on the 370 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.160
 Sony Ericsson 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.210
 can see in 70 are 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:27.710
 to the usb connection to the current 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.510
 the club is 3.5 for the audio 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.280
 here I have a damaged club 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.530
 maybe they did the laments 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.890
 we went out and we found three 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.890
 legs 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.949
 you can see three little legs 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.949
 in the middle leg 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.640
 in this see the crystal cable that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440
 comes 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 of the speaker wire 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.610
 and in these two the order does not matter 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.610
 green cable and blue cable 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.110
 green blue or green does not matter 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 and the other two channels that are missing the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.460
 red and black obviously from the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 current of which I am going to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.090
 show why not 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.930
 Spanish 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.070
 carefully 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 the tape was scanned 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.060
 he feels isolated 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.990
 how can you see 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:02.920
 this thick cable from the usb 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 there is that thick cable that comes 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.159
 is already red and black cable 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.140
 of the other that is 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.880
 the rest to this one 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.880
 blue green 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.099
 and crystalline should not give it out there 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.290
 we will weld 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.810
 it is color range 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.380
 sun we give blue 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.540
 green 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.210
 no crystal 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.569
 and that's it 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.730
 basically this is friends 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.730
 with that he should pull his horns 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.980
 good because it has served them 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.730

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.540
