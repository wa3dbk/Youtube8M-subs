things to look at is across the top here

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.230 
things to look at is across the top here
you'll<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.160> when<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.460> take<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.880> tab<00:01:33.060> one

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you'll see when I do take the tab one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.760 
you'll see when I do take the tab one
tap<00:01:33.480> off<00:01:33.660> that<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.230> makes<00:01:34.440> sure<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> goes

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
tap off that it makes sure it goes

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.020

around the little camera hole here

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.250 
around the little camera hole here
that's<00:01:36.210> probably<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.570> most<00:01:36.720> important<00:01:37.170> thing

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
that's probably the most important thing

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.230 
that's probably the most important thing
if<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> lined<00:01:37.980> up<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:38.910> become

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
if you get that lined up it does become

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
if you get that lined up it does become
a<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.510> easier<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.260> other<00:01:40.290> thing<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.800> look

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a lot easier the other thing is to look

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.500 
a lot easier the other thing is to look
at<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> does<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
at is to see how it does go down the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.680 
at is to see how it does go down the
sides<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:43.440> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.010> Galaxy<00:01:44.460> phones<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:45.030> s3

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
sides now with the Galaxy phones the s3

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.660 
sides now with the Galaxy phones the s3
and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.900> note<00:01:46.080> 2<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.560> actual<00:01:47.400> screen

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and the note 2 the actual screen

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.190 
and the note 2 the actual screen
themselves<00:01:48.150> have<00:01:48.330> very<00:01:48.510> slight<00:01:48.840> curvature

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
themselves have very slight curvature

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
themselves have very slight curvature
all<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.830> way<00:01:49.950> around<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> edges<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
all the way around the edges and so the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.150 
all the way around the edges and so the
screen<00:01:51.660> protectors<00:01:52.230> are<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.830> designed

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
screen protectors are actually designed

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.100 
screen protectors are actually designed
just<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> stop<00:01:53.820> shorter<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.330> curvature<00:01:54.570> if

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just to stop shorter that curvature if

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.570 
just to stop shorter that curvature if
they<00:01:55.290> went<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> edges<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
they went all the way to the edges you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.190 
they went all the way to the edges you
would<00:01:56.760> find<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> screen<00:01:58.110> protector

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
would find that the screen protector

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.900 
would find that the screen protector
itself<00:01:58.650> would<00:01:58.920> start<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.340> bubble<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.700> lift

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
itself would start to bubble and lift

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.450 
itself would start to bubble and lift
over<00:02:00.150> time<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.530> obviously<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> last<00:02:02.160> part

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
over time and so obviously the last part

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.710 
over time and so obviously the last part
of<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.910> make<00:02:03.060> sure<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.510> screen

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
of it is to make sure that the screen

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.150 
of it is to make sure that the screen
protector<00:02:03.870> goes<00:02:04.260> around<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.650> home<00:02:04.830> button

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
protector goes around the home button

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.710 
protector goes around the home button
but<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> will<00:02:05.730> find<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.210> easier<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
but you will find it much easier to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.320 
but you will find it much easier to
start<00:02:06.930> from<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.200> top<00:02:07.350> ok<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.369> easy<00:02:09.030> enough

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
start from the top ok so easy enough

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.780 
start from the top ok so easy enough
again<00:02:09.689> give<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.049> phone<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.769> of<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> wipe<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
again give the phone a bit of a wipe it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.990 
again give the phone a bit of a wipe it
is<00:02:11.939> better<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.689> phone<00:02:12.840> turned<00:02:13.109> off

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
is better to have the phone turned off

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.770 
is better to have the phone turned off
it<00:02:14.540> makes<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.930> little<00:02:15.020> easier<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.380> see<00:02:15.470> and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
it makes it a little easier to see and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.330 
it makes it a little easier to see and
simply<00:02:17.780> start<00:02:18.050> by<00:02:18.140> removing<00:02:18.590> tab<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
simply start by removing tab one and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340 
simply start by removing tab one and
pulling<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> back<00:02:19.850> about<00:02:20.570> two<00:02:21.050> inches

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
pulling it back about two inches

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.680 
pulling it back about two inches
something<00:02:21.710> like<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:23.000> then<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.510> using

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
something like that and then just using

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.320 
something like that and then just using
the<00:02:23.840> tab<00:02:24.140> two<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:25.160> can<00:02:25.310> actually<00:02:25.460> just<00:02:25.880> place

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the tab two you can actually just place

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.130 
the tab two you can actually just place
it<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:27.770> slightly<00:02:28.160> lining<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.850> up<00:02:29.080> right<00:02:30.080> now

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it just slightly lining it up right now

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.690 
it just slightly lining it up right now
the<00:02:30.320> first<00:02:30.860> thing<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.100> looking<00:02:31.130> at<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the first thing I'm looking at is just

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.010 
the first thing I'm looking at is just
to<00:02:31.850> make<00:02:32.000> sure<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.300> right<00:02:32.480> around<00:02:32.690> there

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
to make sure it's right around there

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.960 
to make sure it's right around there
just<00:02:33.230> making<00:02:34.010> sure<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.340> looks<00:02:34.400> pretty<00:02:34.820> good

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
just making sure it looks pretty good

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.690 
just making sure it looks pretty good
down<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.300> edges<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:37.340> does<00:02:37.490> look<00:02:37.670> pretty

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
down the edges and it does look pretty

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.190 
down the edges and it does look pretty
good<00:02:38.650> yep<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.720> pull<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.959> all<00:02:42.080> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
good yep and so as it to pull it all the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.660 
good yep and so as it to pull it all the
way<00:02:42.320> down<00:02:43.840> pull<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.930> off<00:02:45.160> okay<00:02:46.160> now<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:46.580> are

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
way down pull it off okay now there are

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.860 
way down pull it off okay now there are
a<00:02:46.700> few<00:02:46.820> little<00:02:47.000> bubbles<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.390> are<00:02:47.510> formed<00:02:47.780> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
a few little bubbles that are formed and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.240 
a few little bubbles that are formed and
we'll<00:02:47.989> get<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.200> those<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.560> little<00:02:48.650> bit<00:02:48.770> you

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
we'll get to those in a little bit you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.410 
we'll get to those in a little bit you
can<00:02:49.370> actually<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.790> use<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.209> cleaning

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
can actually just use in the cleaning

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.000 
can actually just use in the cleaning
cloth<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:51.410> give<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.709> bit<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.920> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
cloth you can just give it a bit of a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.860 
cloth you can just give it a bit of a
I'm<00:02:52.550> pushing<00:02:52.850> fairly<00:02:53.150> hard<00:02:53.330> fairly<00:02:53.660> firmly

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
I'm pushing fairly hard fairly firmly

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
I'm pushing fairly hard fairly firmly
just<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.350> push<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.680> any<00:02:54.830> bubbles<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.489> then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
just to push out any bubbles and then

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.170 
just to push out any bubbles and then
the<00:02:57.890> next<00:02:58.130> most<00:02:58.250> important<00:02:58.730> part<00:02:58.910> here<00:02:58.970> is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the next most important part here is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.090 
the next most important part here is
this<00:02:59.450> tab<00:02:59.780> is<00:03:00.050> actually<00:03:00.470> another<00:03:00.860> piece<00:03:01.070> of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
this tab is actually another piece of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.760 
this tab is actually another piece of
plastic<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:02.060> people<00:03:02.330> don't<00:03:03.140> realize<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.650> and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
plastic some people don't realize it and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.949 
plastic some people don't realize it and
try<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.950> pull<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> tab<00:03:04.820> itself<00:03:05.150> off<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:05.870> you

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
try to pull the tab itself off but you

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.300 
try to pull the tab itself off but you
actually<00:03:06.110> need<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.440> remove<00:03:06.739> another<00:03:07.010> film

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
actually need to remove another film

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.199 
actually need to remove another film
here<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.000> very<00:03:08.209> slowly<00:03:08.630> pulling<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.739> back

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
here so very slowly pulling it back

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.340 
here so very slowly pulling it back
because<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.300> are<00:03:11.480> pulling<00:03:11.720> away<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.989> piece<00:03:12.200> of
