00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.880
 hello my name is graf number and me 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.620
 I'm a football statistician and I'm just 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.390
 here because wm actually always goes and 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.430
 you should not make any jokes about israel 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.780
 behind such a television transmission of 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.430
 Of course there is a lot of football playing 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.019
 more people than you initially suspect 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.419
 I do not like talking about them 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.769
 cameramen or the cable carriers or 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.539
 the reporters 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.070
 I will from the experts the 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.409
 experts write their texts 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.359
 I'm talking about the editors of it 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.579
 create the disproportion of the drinks 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.410
 at the copacabana somehow on that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.180
 result of the games 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.280
 and I'm talking about the poor sow the ground 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.019
 7 to 1 win from germany manually with 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.010
 the mouse wheel through the scorers list 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.600
 had to scroll 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.480
 and belong to these important people 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.699
 I also have an immense amount of statistics 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.620
 important task, after all , I feel 30 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.640
 percent of the broadcast time and that 's yes 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.699
 also my task 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.739
 I should pay reasonably realistic 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.539
 the halfway relevant topics are the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.980
 The moderator then somehow bring in 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.140
 can feel around send time or 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.300
 to support some reasoning 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.370
 usually i work for politician 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.250
 I also call myself a kind 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.230
 mathematical ghostwriter 73 percent 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.670
 my friends always ask me if that 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.770
 statistics and of course do not agree 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.230
 I used to struggle a lot earlier 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.420
 but given in times of violent and 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.220
 In fact nobody cares anymore 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.740
 therefore, whether an astonishing number, too 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.900
 a realistic number is with no one 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.780
 I mean 64 percent of the brunettes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.460
 audience but that's not enough think 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 You can say yes to 50 percent of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.610
 finger the statistics will be deducted 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.780
 Yes, more and more at some point he remains 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 the quality on the track 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.950
 that's like youtube videos but what for 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 realistic numbers if that anyway 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 nobody checked and then we'll take it 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.790
 the trails 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.590
 We used to have one with us 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.940
 geodesic triangle from the screen 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.860
 then with the help of complicated 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.170
 Relationship formulas on the routes of the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.430
 Player came after his burnout 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.050
 After two weeks we have but then 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.580
 also noticed that no one anyway 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.330
 if we check the results too 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.550
 only appreciate 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.350
 Meanwhile, the entire team was on 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 I reduce myself, I believe the others 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.300
 work in an election office somewhere 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.710
 north korea or so and I'm counting 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.739
 stop at most pay on mine 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.030
 Belly feeling the gates of klose to 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.320
 I did not count any example either 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.370
 but I thought it was going to be now 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.680
 slowly 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.450
 of meals anyway is the job 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.860
 Of course, not quite undemanding me 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.610
 must first know what the people 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 Want to know irony has never been mine 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.290
 strength which let 99 percent of 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.780
 statistics from computers generate the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.360
 Generate sentences like never before 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.000
 a European team in eighth 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 a semi-final tie 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.730
 played 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.870
 I judge then only if that 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.129
 realistic or not what 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.780
 realistic then we say that 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.980
 statistics comes from us if not then 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.099
 let's say that is somewhere on the internet 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.599
 so that videos around 90 percent of the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.670
 Rating ratio is 90 percent 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.959
 if not then have the positive 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.410
 Do not look at the statistics 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.420
 held 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.489
 I have to go now to 100 percent 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.480
 because nobody has ever been to the end 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.480
 these videos stayed here
