00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
I think sometimes that can be like

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.260 
I think sometimes that can be like
counterproductive<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:57.030> even<00:01:57.210> though

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
counterproductive because even though

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.260 
counterproductive because even though
you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.390> carry<00:01:57.690> more<00:01:57.900> things<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.520> means<00:01:59.670> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you can carry more things it means that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.360 
you can carry more things it means that
you<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.440> stuff<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.800> through<00:02:01.920> all

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
you have more stuff to go through all

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.220 
you have more stuff to go through all

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.660 
with this guy
isn't<00:03:00.320> like<00:03:00.500> too<00:03:00.710> bad<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> guy

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.490 

this<00:03:04.120> distance<00:03:05.080> from<00:03:05.290> our

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
this distance from our

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.980 
this distance from our
we're<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.160> undead<00:03:07.550> areas<00:03:08.030> which<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.600> don't<00:03:08.660> know

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
we're in undead areas which I don't know

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.450 
we're in undead areas which I don't know
I<00:03:09.020> mean<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.590> creators<00:03:09.950> were<00:03:10.070> going<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.340> come

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
I mean the creators were going to come

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.770 
I mean the creators were going to come
across<00:03:10.580> at<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.000> point<00:03:11.270> might<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:11.570> even<00:03:11.630> be

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
across at this point might not even be

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.540 
across at this point might not even be
level<00:03:12.020> 13<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.590> might<00:03:12.710> be<00:03:12.800> higher<00:03:13.040> than<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
level 13 it might be higher than that so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.240 
level 13 it might be higher than that so
let's<00:03:14.180> find<00:03:14.810> out<00:03:15.020> if<00:03:15.380> we'll<00:03:15.770> get<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> use<00:03:16.100> it

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
let's find out if we'll get to use it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
let's find out if we'll get to use it
sooner<00:03:16.550> rather<00:03:16.670> than<00:03:16.790> later

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
sooner rather than later

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.240 
sooner rather than later
so<00:03:19.560> whilst<00:03:19.890> we<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.310> here

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.920 

I<00:03:24.370> can<00:03:24.940> break<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.360> one<00:03:25.570> down<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.810> think<00:03:26.050> it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
I can break that one down I think it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.220 
I can break that one down I think it
the<00:03:27.319> tables<00:03:28.269> get<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.420> restoration<00:03:29.959> effect

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the tables get the restoration effect

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.810 
the tables get the restoration effect
off<00:03:30.379> of<00:03:30.530> that

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.780 

so<00:03:35.820> Lola<00:03:36.060> fell

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
so Lola fell

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.300 
so Lola fell
I<00:03:37.909> think<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.719> thing<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.019> want<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.290> do<00:03:39.439> is<00:03:39.799> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
I think the one thing I want to do is I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.850 
I think the one thing I want to do is I
buy<00:03:40.790> this

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.430 

I<00:03:42.890> want<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.370> get<00:03:43.550> also<00:03:44.210> a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.330 

so<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.160> get<00:03:49.490> a<00:03:49.840> thing<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.020> so<00:03:51.290> we<00:03:51.410> can<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:52.010> just

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
so I get a thing get so we can just just

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.960 
so I get a thing get so we can just just
want<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.700> think<00:03:52.940> we<00:03:53.060> do

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.360 

so<00:03:56.570> we<00:03:56.690> remember<00:03:57.080> nothing<00:03:57.740> but<00:03:57.890> generally

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
so we remember nothing but generally

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.700 
so we remember nothing but generally
fire<00:03:58.640> salts<00:03:59.090> will<00:03:59.240> do<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.960> fortune<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.560> a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
fire salts will do the fortune of a

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.420 
fire salts will do the fortune of a
difference

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.559 

we<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.180> increase<00:04:05.599> that

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
we can increase that

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.309 
we can increase that
I<00:04:06.739> thought<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.920> was<00:04:08.159> just<00:04:08.610> regular<00:04:09.299> bow<00:04:09.959> that

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
I thought this was just regular bow that

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.839 
I thought this was just regular bow that
we<00:04:10.409> had<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.769> give<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.159> somebody

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
we had to give to somebody

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.560 
we had to give to somebody
