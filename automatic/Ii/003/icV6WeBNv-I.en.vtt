00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
know I think Nana's the species have a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.420 
know I think Nana's the species have a
long<00:01:23.400> longer<00:01:23.880> road<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.950> decided

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
long longer road to go and so we decided

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.130 
long longer road to go and so we decided
we're<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:28.340> well<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:30.350> think<00:01:31.350> men<00:01:32.119> men

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
we're not going well I I think men men

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.620 
we're not going well I I think men men
definitely<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.369> incredible

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
definitely have a really incredible

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.649 
definitely have a really incredible
powerful<00:01:36.630> role<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> play<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> those

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
powerful role to play in all of those

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and I think women as they begin to learn

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
and I think women as they begin to learn
to<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.049> their<00:01:43.320> power<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.670> stand<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to take their power and to stand in that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.980 
to take their power and to stand in that
power<00:01:46.250> absolutely<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.670> men<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> same

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.130 
but men and women especially have to
kind<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.640> get<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.940> groove<00:02:16.300> back<00:02:16.660> they<00:02:16.960> have

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
kind of get that groove back they have

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.890 
kind of get that groove back they have
to<00:02:17.380> they<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.190> understand<00:02:18.870> what<00:02:19.870> that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
to they have to understand what that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.500 
to they have to understand what that
means<00:02:20.260> because<00:02:20.620> once<00:02:21.070> one<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.460> them<00:02:21.880> starts<00:02:22.240> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
means because once one of them starts to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.810 
means because once one of them starts to
empower<00:02:22.840> themselves<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.590> other<00:02:23.740> one<00:02:24.040> starts

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
empower themselves the other one starts

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.490 
empower themselves the other one starts
to<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> hard<00:02:25.450> time<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
to have a hard time because it's like a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.710 
to have a hard time because it's like a
dance<00:02:26.800> they've<00:02:27.220> gotten<00:02:27.580> used<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.270> energy

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
dance they've gotten used to the energy

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.710 
dance they've gotten used to the energy
exchange<00:02:29.440> between<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.640> two<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.120> once

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
exchange between the two and once

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
exchange between the two and once
someone<00:02:32.080> steps<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.650> up<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.860> notch<00:02:33.040> or<00:02:33.220> raises

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
someone steps it up a notch or raises

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120 
someone steps it up a notch or raises
the<00:02:33.760> vibration<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.510> themselves<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.590> changes

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the vibration of themselves it changes

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.530 
the vibration of themselves it changes
the<00:02:36.280> dynamic<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.910> vibration<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the dynamic and vibration of the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
the dynamic and vibration of the
relationship<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> other<00:02:38.830> partner

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
relationship and so the other partner

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.160 
relationship and so the other partner
has<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> choice<00:02:39.670> they<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.210> lift<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:41.020> that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
has a choice they can lift up that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780 
has a choice they can lift up that
really<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.650> know<00:02:41.740> lift<00:02:41.950> up<00:02:42.100> their<00:02:42.220> vibration

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
really you know lift up their vibration

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.120 
really you know lift up their vibration
and<00:02:42.970> empower<00:02:43.300> themselves<00:02:43.570> also<00:02:44.130> because

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and empower themselves also because

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.980 
and empower themselves also because
we're<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.370> victims<00:02:46.000> unless<00:02:46.330> we're<00:02:46.480> enabled
