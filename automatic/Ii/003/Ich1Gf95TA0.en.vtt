 super tasty and super easy recipes 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.380
 Perfect for school leaves too 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.880
 not our super cool competition 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.349
 so check in any case again a 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.060
 infobox there everything is in it 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.100
 we start with a super delicious 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.970
 Couscous vegetable frying pan is quite easy 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.340
 could prepare for it the evening before 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.940
 you just need carrots 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.440
 couscous vegetables your choice cook his 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.899
 zucchini then tomatoes, for example 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.739
 Cucumber everything your vegetables heart 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.300
 first of all , she desires to cook her couscous 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.300
 as it says on the packaging 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.110
 afterwards there is simply in the bowl 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.110
 and let it cool down a bit 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.680
 and then you cut it easily 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.810
 vegetables so their cucumbers or tomatoes 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.189
 everything the vines I like write 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.390
 I also all quantities and so 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.860
 Continue to the info box 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.039
 So in any case looked 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.039
 purely 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.940
 also cut the zucchini so small 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.490
 Small as you like to have and then 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 give it all in the pan 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.830
 So first a little oil in and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.830
 then fry the zucchini 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 best we spice a bit 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.979
 with the spices you like and have 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 stir well 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.350
 if you have seared it enough then 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.890
 can you now take your couscous and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.720
 to give it a whole lot easier 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.150
 then take your cook cream and give 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.890
 of it also a little something about it 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.050
 the whole thing gets a bit creamier and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 tastes much better 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.940
 and of course stir everything again and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.780
 now you can still your remaining 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.960
 Add vegetables 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.370
 that is going to be a nasty breakdown 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.970
 Of course we do not stir that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 to forget 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.150
 in the end could be your carrots 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.620
 I've got it over here 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.330
 Which bought the already honed 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.760
 But it could be very easy 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.930
 Do it yourself if you like and then 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.030
 Are you already finished? 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.780
 super delicious and easy for the job 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.780
 school and college 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.370
 the next more such a small snack 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.650
 So a super delicious nut fruit salad 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.940
 it is made easily and quickly 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.940
 and tastes really good 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.349
 all you need fruits of course 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:33.879
 your choice so for example apple bananas for 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:35.379
 yourself and very important you must 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.659
 you probably already think what now 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:43.959
 happened so it is first the fruit 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:46.900
 chopped fill apple I have 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.220
 for bringing a supercool machine i 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.599
 Link something like that to the infobox 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.400
 is really great 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.109
 you just have to press on it so that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 Press apple and then you have 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.599
 even such cool apple carving you only 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.599
 still have to cut small 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.959
 if you cut the fruit ready 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.690
 then you just take one 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:21.840
 container of your choice and fills up 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.150
 then take some fruits of your choice 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.410
 her some nuts and jan 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.790
 is the one to do it again and again 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.950
 take turns but it has a nice 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.000
 Mixture could best also on 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:40.710
 Shake the end a bit more 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:42.300
 and then everything is well mixed than 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.160
 Finally we have a great one 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.760
 cool rap the really fast and 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.760
 just goes 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.289
 you just need yogurt for that 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.459
 vegetables of your choice salad then what you 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.539
 wanted to clean or to 

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:07.499
 cheese or sausage, for example, or so our 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:09.539
 very important raps now, first time 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:13.039
 vegetable small cut we have ourselves 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.039
 this time only for cucumbers 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.880
 you can still put your rap in the 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.440
 Give the microwave and warm and 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.060
 then just brush it with a 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.289
 thin layer and thick layer like him 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.289
 that you like with yogurt 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.330
 Now it's time to prove it 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.330

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.490

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.980
 then you take your salad and vegetables eg 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.630
