00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.220
 very good one more day from here from 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 hac one telephony today I bring you two 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 small a boxing have nothing of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 special many of the objects that you go 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.000
 to see now, we've already seen them in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000
 other occasions 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.350
 what's important is not that let's start 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.240
 first with the yellow packet 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 in this case 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.140
 just what is here and inside there is therefore 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 you have seen many times in boxing 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 is a product would be to do some 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.700
 way 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.570
 the rare ones that every time reactivated more than 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.520
 what I already receive but good 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 normally good are for friends and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 all that, therefore, already 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.470
 I miss a little the grace 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.470
 ah 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.600
 it seems curious is that they take advantage of 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.600
 space these guys 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 We have a iphone 4s 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.330
 good what a peculiar idea he has because 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.900
 I have asked for it or I will not explain it 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.900
 right away 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 a finish the place is the typical finish 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 sparkly 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:29.180
 we remove the protective tab 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.780
 ok now we take out the protective tab 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 let's say you stayed you can see it 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.500
 I was mate 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.770
 so good 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.040
 it's a bullshit 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.700
 basically it was because I had 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.700
 96 cents d 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.810
 the gift 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.520
 and good here comes the usual thing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.149
 my parents 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.149
 In color blue 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.650
 with all their respective accessories 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.240
 your typical box 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.040
 and great finishes like almost always 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.900
 some problem I have had with any of 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 these but 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.950
 but very well the truth 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.930
 if I'm going to mark it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.120
 more than anything taught what I'm going 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.129
 to say seeing why good this month more 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.010
 the movidito month will arrive many 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.230
 things including a conversion kit 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 for the iphone 4s that good I'm going to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.739
 explain now what we are going to do with 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.739
 the conversion retinue 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 do not 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.380
 d 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.180
 it's basically 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.590
 because they are a type of novelties that 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.990
 they use for sporting me 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.050
 I have one for when I'm going to make some and 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.780
 all that and the truth is very comfortable 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.760
 they come with a cablecito of load and 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.730
 best of all is the price that is a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.780
 mp3 that for only 360 d seems to go 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.690
 the 330 has a radio and card input 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.030
 microsd to listen to own music not 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 obviously good I asked for an organ 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.590
 higher 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.590
 period 5 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.510
 4 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.370
 5 are for a classmate 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.400
 good now said since I have them 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.560
 all since I have a family that 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.880
 I want so much now said coll areal 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.530
 or one each and here is 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.640
 and well I will explain a little 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.640
 what about the conversion kit 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.460
 he has paid us all the time 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.920
 basically what I 'm going to do is very 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.870
 simple 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.340
 the iphone well well I have it enough 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.540
 well it is not careful 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.430
 but hey a little tired of seeing it for 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.730
 example all these things that you are going to see 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.730
 now 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.990
 is a little scratched or not 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.670
 second-hand could not wait anymore 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:55.230
 but 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.120
 Well, I said why I'm not going to buy 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.690
 buy a conversion kit and it's good 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.070
 that I have bought or I will summarize 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.480
 basically we have bought an edge 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.520
 of metal and with black in black a 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.820
 blue screen and one green screen 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.340
 the blue is in fact chrome 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.830
 and then a blue back and in 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.480
 green 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.880
 could make a complete change of 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.190
 fact phone 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.100
 in the central part let's say the metal 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.710
 comes with all the pieces of 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.810
 well the speaker the buttons all 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.180
 what we say you have to dismantle and pass 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.950
 let's say this one about this one 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.130
 of this young man 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.230
 from this central part to the new one let's say 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.980
 but in that one in this case it's already 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.980
 completely 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.360
 they are stones 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.270
 completely new so that what 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.640
 you understand that phone the telephone 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.010
 when he arrives let's say those 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.680
 pieces the only thing that will remain old 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.210
 It is the motherboard 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.620
 because everything else is going to be replaced 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.690
 so nothing if you want down I'm going to 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.540
 leave the links of everything we have 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.640
 pulled out here of also what 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.020
 what was being discussed and nothing 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.430
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.430
