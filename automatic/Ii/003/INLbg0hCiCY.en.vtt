stereo double-check that

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.650 
stereo double-check that
no<00:04:51.090> actually<00:04:51.840> I'm<00:04:52.260> using<00:04:52.490> cardioid<00:04:53.660> cardioid

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
no actually I'm using cardioid cardioid

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.260 
no actually I'm using cardioid cardioid
is<00:04:54.810> what<00:04:54.990> I'm<00:04:55.080> using

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so using cardioid and my gain is

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:11.900 
so using cardioid and my gain is
somewhere<00:05:02.010> between<00:05:02.780> 25<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:08.930> 50<00:05:09.930> percent<00:05:10.910> so

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
somewhere between 25 and 50 percent so

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.089

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
will be a project I assume that we will

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.700 
will be a project I assume that we will
do

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.550 

and<00:07:27.710> you'll<00:07:28.460> follow<00:07:28.730> up<00:07:29.000> on<00:07:29.210> and<00:07:29.540> it<00:07:30.290> will<00:07:30.380> be<00:07:30.530> a

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
and you'll follow up on and it will be a

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.670 
and you'll follow up on and it will be a
new<00:07:30.800> little<00:07:31.100> segment<00:07:31.550> to<00:07:31.670> our<00:07:31.730> channel

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
new little segment to our channel

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:40.540 
new little segment to our channel
building<00:07:33.790> my<00:07:34.790> lego<00:07:35.090> city<00:07:35.390> in<00:07:36.520> Minecraft<00:07:39.190> so<00:07:40.190> I

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550 
building my lego city in Minecraft so I

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.230 
building my lego city in Minecraft so I
guess<00:07:41.240> like<00:07:42.430> while<00:07:43.430> I<00:07:43.460> get<00:07:43.820> the<00:07:43.910> streets

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
guess like while I get the streets

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.420 
guess like while I get the streets
finished<00:07:44.720> up<00:07:44.990> I<00:07:45.290> guess<00:07:45.890> I'll<00:07:46.040> end<00:07:46.220> the<00:07:46.310> video

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
finished up I guess I'll end the video

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.850 
finished up I guess I'll end the video
and<00:07:47.300> like<00:07:47.420> I<00:07:47.600> said<00:07:47.660> hopefully<00:07:48.170> it<00:07:48.560> won't<00:07:48.710> be

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
and like I said hopefully it won't be

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.940 
and like I said hopefully it won't be
too<00:07:49.610> long<00:07:50.710> maybe<00:07:51.710> at<00:07:52.130> max<00:07:52.520> a<00:07:52.880> week<00:07:53.920> before<00:07:54.920> I

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950 
too long maybe at max a week before I

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.600 
too long maybe at max a week before I
get<00:07:55.460> the<00:07:56.950> streets<00:07:57.950> finished<00:07:58.250> out<00:07:58.370> and<00:07:58.520> we'll

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.610 
get the streets finished out and we'll

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.880 
get the streets finished out and we'll
