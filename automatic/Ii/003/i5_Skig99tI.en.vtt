00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.710 
through the back so if you guys have a
race<00:02:10.429> with<00:02:10.640> guns<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.270> bit<00:02:11.360> unfair

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
race with guns it's a little bit unfair

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.030 
race with guns it's a little bit unfair
but<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.110> car<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.350> fair<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:12.770> there's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
but this car is fair because there's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.410 
but this car is fair because there's
that<00:02:13.160> back<00:02:13.370> window<00:02:13.550> then<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:13.850> guys<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.210> shoot

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
that back window then you guys can shoot

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.940 
that back window then you guys can shoot
through<00:02:14.630> now<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.410> little<00:02:15.590> bit<00:02:15.710> hard<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
through now it is a little bit hard to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.140 
through now it is a little bit hard to
shoot<00:02:16.190> through<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:16.730> least<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
shoot through there but at least it's a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.449 
shoot through there but at least it's a
little<00:02:17.390> bit<00:02:17.480> fairer<00:02:17.750> than<00:02:17.840> other<00:02:18.140> cars<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:19.280> as

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
little bit fairer than other cars now as

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.949 
little bit fairer than other cars now as
you<00:02:19.580> guys<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.880> solve<00:02:20.060> back<00:02:20.209> there<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.810> if

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
you guys can solve back there you got if

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.270 
you guys can solve back there you got if
you<00:02:20.990> guys<00:02:21.230> paid<00:02:21.440> attention<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> gameplay

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
you guys paid attention to the gameplay

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.500 
you guys paid attention to the gameplay
if<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.520> guys<00:02:22.610> did<00:02:22.790> not<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.120> scroll<00:02:23.360> back

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
if you guys did not just scroll back

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.449 
if you guys did not just scroll back
over<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:24.260> 30<00:02:24.500> seconds<00:02:24.860> or<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.310> guys

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
over like 30 seconds or so and you guys

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.150 
over like 30 seconds or so and you guys
will<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.850> me<00:02:26.060> crashing<00:02:26.810> into<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.020> car

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
will see me crashing into a car

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.800 
will see me crashing into a car
definitely<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.430> has<00:02:28.700> too<00:02:29.030> much<00:02:29.210> handling

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
definitely this has too much handling

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.840 
definitely this has too much handling
it's<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.350> little<00:02:30.530> bit<00:02:30.620> too<00:02:30.800> sensitive<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.490> do<00:02:31.610> not

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
it's a little bit too sensitive I do not

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.349 
it's a little bit too sensitive I do not
like<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> handling

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
like the handling

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.330 
like the handling
I<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.659> want<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> go<00:02:33.959> all<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.200> negative<00:02:34.680> but

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
I do not want to go all out negative but

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
I do not want to go all out negative but
definitely<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.239> not<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> best<00:02:36.689> choice

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
definitely it is not the best choice

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.509 
definitely it is not the best choice
