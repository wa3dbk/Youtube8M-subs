00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 It is. 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:37.410
 Even if the basic armed forces are not completely neutral, 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:41.610
 In some cases , there is a machine gun in an armor glove and then on the inside 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.360
 I usually speak of vehicles that can be infantry or combat troops. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.480

 And it looks like there's a hatch on the back. 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.140
 And let's fly. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.780
 Unlike other common vehicles, the one that controls the other side is like a dancer. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.420
 Looks like I'm putting in my face and making adjustments. 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.450
 Give me the top five Tom . 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.450

 I do not want to move the wheel in detail . 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.149
 It looks like this. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.149

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.270

 So I've been going to look at moving Baki 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.500
 Take the infantry could move to No. 1, but for example, the truck now 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.380
 Then, when attacked, 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.380
 I can not even fight . 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.499
 You know, I need a car with some gloves. 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.200

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.250
 uh 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.650
 And the safety doubt is not coming to the station, but the strength is better than the 4WD 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:04.349
 I do not think going further queries Good 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.879
 It's too slow and you do not have to be fast anyway . 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.280
