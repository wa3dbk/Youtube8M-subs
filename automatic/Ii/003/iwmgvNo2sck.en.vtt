00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.039
 essentially political freedom when it was 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 hence the march of marijuana gives a favela in the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.690
 River 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.509

 intentions acted against God's will 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 [Music] 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.840
 The pastor is still there. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 children of God and when the pope marries 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 even those who do not smoke know how to roll very well 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.869

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.479
 In Brazil, our legislation is already 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.360
 the world's softest bands in Brazil 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 They are not curious about marijuana. 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.470
 which books is released half 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.970
 interest since it loses to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.010
 completely against 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.320
 It's a step to take more eyes on drugs than 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.030
 ask for a little money for the cigarette 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.790

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.420
 this drug ends up stimulating some to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.810

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.590
