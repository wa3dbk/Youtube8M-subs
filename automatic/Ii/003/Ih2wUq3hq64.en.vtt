00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.970
 and whenever there is a big game is to avoid 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.820
 the comparisons between graph between kings 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.759
 between is speed so much of xbox the year 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 how much in playstation 4 beauty now has 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.039
 some issues that the following from the xbox 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.109
 the year everyone thought that all 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.590
 games would be running at 60 frames per 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 second with the 1080p resolution but not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 It was well this way this morning, people 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.759
 showed these days the game tomb 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.000
 raider long game ryder that ran in the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.460
 xbox in the year up to 24 frames per second 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 this is very little when it comes to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.450
 new generation consoles but microsoft 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 said that this is not her problem for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 the producers and that yes xbox or you can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 a strong machine can roll 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.719
 any game at 1080p 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 the spokesman microsoft hard and the goal 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.840
 he said the following in the British newspaper 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.750
 the guardian 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 he said that xbox is not capable of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.980
 to play games in 80 pesos between frames 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 per second so much that it makes a strong 5 is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.119
 a good example that this is possible 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 he said that people without ruling out 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.189
 old concepts to compare some 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 consoles as polygons and fixed in 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.619
 number of frames installed that now 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 this new video game season 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.420
 generation that counts only the software 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.520
 hardware and the cloud behind this batch 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 again a good excuse because then no 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.509
 said he's inside the video game 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.600
 videogame radio but rather the processing 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.610
 through the cloud through servers 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.650
 the same game made a point of talking about the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.829
 fake card that has been super good 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.680
 happened on the xbox and they pointed this out to 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 fact of the many dedicated servers of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.439
 microsoft for it to run even rotate 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 online 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.119
 then he was asked whether others 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.979
 games without winning games exclusive to 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.780
 microsoft games that were created by 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.970
 How does motorcycle sport do then I do? 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.850
 also asked if these other games 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 would be this dedication of the servers if 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 It seems like no guy he said the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.969
 Microsoft is committed to enabling 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.890
 producers to obtain the maximum 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.200
 investments they made and talked about 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.770
 that in the launch of the main games 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.769
 will not fail to make available the 300 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.959
 thousand servers dedicated by microsoft 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.690
 but not all microsoft games 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.430
 who will be in all these 300 thousand 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.430
 servers dedicated to it
