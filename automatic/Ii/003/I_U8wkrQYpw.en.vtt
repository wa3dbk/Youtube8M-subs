00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:17.290
 how about friends this time the hard 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:17.290
 reset for alcatel 40 10 40 36 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.859
 good 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 Moment not like 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.660
 good the option to deal with the code 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.390
 of the blockade is going to be to press this 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 volume key up and the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.260
 switched on 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 we will press accounts until 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.760
 do not turn on and we appear then type 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.800
 from before 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.800
 and we already have as we can see 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.440
 of the room 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.280
 i 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.620
 a tour 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.239
 and we are going to give in white factorial face 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 remember that we move with the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.710
 keys 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.860
 of column and we will have accepted with 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 we do not use it until 10 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.020
 but the code 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 and let's remember together tarda tardÃ  

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.159
 distances 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.600
 I hope it has been helpful 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.340
 what you need and so on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.990
 It can be the pairs to know how much 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.100
 I can 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.620
 I do not help them as much as I can in 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.790
 how much can also for work 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.790
 it would be 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.680
 hopefully turn on so they see in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.680
 this equipment been blocked 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.870
 but remember in this regard not 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.870
 It works in different 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.970
 but the bike of some equipment but if 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.660
 is that we 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.660
 so 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.950
 and point 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.980
 the method has not been helpful 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.780
 and good 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.080
 as is more remind that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.020
 search 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.000
 impact and all that you know 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.000
 we are to do next
