Mantid<00:00:00.709> we're<00:00:01.709> starting<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.190> path<00:00:02.429> system

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
Mantid we're starting our path system

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.349 
Mantid we're starting our path system
it's<00:00:05.040> actually<00:00:05.339> gonna<00:00:05.460> start<00:00:05.819> here<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.240> we're

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
it's actually gonna start here but we're

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.259 
it's actually gonna start here but we're
gonna<00:00:06.450> pour<00:00:06.899> some<00:00:07.109> concrete<00:00:07.290> down<00:00:07.790> on<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
gonna pour some concrete down on the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.570 
gonna pour some concrete down on the
landing<00:00:09.660> pad<00:00:09.870> right<00:00:10.110> here<00:00:10.170> where<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> stairs

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
landing pad right here where the stairs

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.629 
landing pad right here where the stairs
transition<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:13.590> underneath<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> deck<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
transition to up underneath the deck and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.200 
transition to up underneath the deck and
then<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:16.910> crawl<00:00:17.910> space

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
then they have a little crawl space

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.970 
then they have a little crawl space
under<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.140> we're<00:00:19.289> gonna<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> all

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
under there so we're gonna this is all

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
under there so we're gonna this is all
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.580> concrete<00:00:21.119> pad<00:00:22.460> but<00:00:23.460> our<00:00:23.810> path

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
going to be a concrete pad but our path

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.679 
going to be a concrete pad but our path
system<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.439> gonna<00:00:25.619> flow<00:00:25.859> through<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.689> it's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
system is gonna flow through here it's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.230 
system is gonna flow through here it's
going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.019> made<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.880> out<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.939> these

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
going to be made out of out of these

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.170 
going to be made out of out of these
little<00:00:30.660> wooden<00:00:31.109> borders<00:00:31.850> that's<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:33.059> have

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
little wooden borders that's gonna have

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.130 
little wooden borders that's gonna have
kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.329> earth<00:00:36.480> tone<00:00:37.520> pebble<00:00:38.629> rock<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
kind of an earth tone pebble rock in the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
kind of an earth tone pebble rock in the
middle<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:41.550> step<00:00:41.940> stones<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> we're

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
middle and then step stones so we're

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
middle and then step stones so we're
removing<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.600> bit<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.969> top<00:00:47.969> layer

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
removing a little bit of the top layer

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.529 
removing a little bit of the top layer
of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> soil<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> rocks<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.449> putting<00:00:51.449> in

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
of the soil for the rocks and putting in

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:27.810 
of the soil for the rocks and putting in
our<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:52.079> borders

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:02:03.010

like<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.979> this<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.520> branches<00:02:08.269> are<00:02:08.390> coming

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
like that this the branches are coming

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.530 
like that this the branches are coming
out<00:02:08.750> there<00:02:08.929> towards<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.180> it's<00:02:11.180> probably<00:02:11.450> a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
out there towards you so it's probably a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.710 
out there towards you so it's probably a
fuller<00:02:11.780> look<00:02:12.019> inside<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.560> side

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.690 

I<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:20.440> those<00:02:20.680> branches<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.520> way

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
I like those branches going this way

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.740 
I like those branches going this way
though<00:02:21.820> cuz<00:02:22.120> they're<00:02:22.240> not<00:02:22.270> gonna<00:02:22.510> collide

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
though cuz they're not gonna collide

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:39.410 
though cuz they're not gonna collide
with<00:02:22.930> an<00:02:23.050> alley<00:02:23.230> there

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:03:01.910 

yeah<00:02:39.990> that's<00:02:40.170> cool

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.220 

but<00:03:02.920> Nick<00:03:03.070> Bloodgood<00:03:03.550> Japanese<00:03:04.030> maple<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
but Nick Bloodgood Japanese maple in the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:16.650 
but Nick Bloodgood Japanese maple in the
landscape<00:03:13.110> again<00:03:14.110> we've<00:03:14.440> put<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.040> up<00:03:15.660> above

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
landscape again we've put it up above

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.080 
landscape again we've put it up above
the<00:03:17.200> grade<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:19.000> drainage<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.990> route<00:03:20.200> purposes

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the grade for drainage on route purposes

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.470 
the grade for drainage on route purposes
and<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:22.360> we'll<00:03:22.540> round<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.440> up<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.760> create<00:03:25.450> a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
and then we'll round it up and create a

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.280 
and then we'll round it up and create a
little<00:03:26.220> watering<00:03:27.220> trough<00:03:27.820> around<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:32.170> have

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
little watering trough around it we have

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.140 
little watering trough around it we have
to<00:03:32.410> pass<00:03:32.730> borders<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.790> we're<00:03:37.000> going<00:03:37.120> to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
to pass borders in and we're going to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.709 
to pass borders in and we're going to
put<00:03:37.330> stone<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.750> here<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.320> few
