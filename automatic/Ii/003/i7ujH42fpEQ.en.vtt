00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.499
 Do you expect no support tomorrow? 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.019
 in the Dortmund stadium 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.059
 not only from the south tribune but maybe also in the whole stadium 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.509
 the fire in a great mood when we are with the national team 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.990
 have played 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.760
 yes that's right Percent think the whole team is looking forward to that 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.259
 Atmosphere in the 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.439
 I'll say Westfalenstadion 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.109
 To be welcomed, good running as a national team among the audience 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 once very, very helpful 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.520
 Under the atmosphere is great that's yes 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.890
 Percent of one of the most beautiful soccer scarf in Germany was like that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.450
 to grow 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.940
 under 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.450
 We are already looking forward to a few weeks since we knew 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.790
 that percent that appears the game is percent from the atmosphere ago 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.480
 preferably 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.960
 Zentek ans Tuns one or maybe even more reasons why call that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.440
 Defensive behavior Tomorrow will be better than Percent Costa Rica 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.180
 So the first customer is very aware that we are aware of our mistakes 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.190
 we did 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 and Pröll the second is that we are already four five days further in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.570
 the showcases com 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.400
 Herr Lehmann and the wm-gold in Germany sometimes drives strange things 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.410
 blossoms 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 on the debate last days offer percent of the gum in the target after the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 second goal of Costa Rica spit out 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.890
 could explain to verify this offer he had them 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.240
 take actual purchase and have also given way to percent 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 second goal 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.920
 So I really had a bubblegum 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.160
 but alone 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.780
 the management had to get rid of those 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.910
 he has against 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.090
 for how many stations have gone 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 That is what we want to know exactly as an answer 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 as such, a shock just before the election expires only offered 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.900
 Andorra city birth 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.130
 well 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 the seller from Biberach percent refers to the recordings SG Telgte 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.750
 but I believe that there are shipping costs of four failed 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 Euro 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.390
 we'll pass that on to FIFA for the record 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.399
 to be examined at the appropriate opportunity he began 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.749
 over there Red 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.619
 I join the joy of Günther Ofner Lehmann now is even one 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.799
 Chewing gum like they spit out might be interesting 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.949
 can you look forward to her pleasure over her for Bayern 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.459
 is awarded major tournament as number one has changed well outside 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.769
 compared to percent in the tournaments they participated in as number two and three 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.229
 to have 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.689
 Anniversary that's the beautiful that I can play that's a great one 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.319
 difference 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.909
 like sitting on the bench 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.589
 under the second thing the testers see 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.349
 I realize that otherwise percent normal life is little restricted no matter 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.089
 what you do where you go 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.009
 yes, now with my teammates 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.020
 of course due to the fact that the World Cup is taking place in Germany 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.140
 a bit like that 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.149
 Private limited to freedom of movement which is not so nice 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.429
 in order to Bibis in are also relatively normal 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.079
 to go everywhere and to do and leave what they want 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.499
 that's enough for the two 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.859
 Year bigger difference the indie band the two biggest 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.229
 differences 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.639
 but now she gets one percent off her future percent 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.179
 outside and to see a clubmate Thomas Mohr Rietpietsch I go 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.179
 have made the first two goals 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.239
 the old town looked at natural healthy 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.469
 and it is nice that Tomasson is now in good shape at the beginning of the 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.499
 tournament 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:32.899
 but 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.649
 as a future 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.630
 I would like to make a camera 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.529
 that is now one to ten percent recovered 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.589
 with the Czech team under then with us big trumps 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:44.399
 I have 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.190
 Actelion's big german goalkeeper in the world talked to the cops Kik 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.930
 and old 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.540
 He said that they are 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.050
 Percent of the right Walter German national team on 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.999
 this season in the arsenals 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:01.879
 they also have around the inexperienced with the food so young famous 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.759
 but all he plays l for a victory 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.789
 it really is not an advantage which music 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.810
 I think that I am against this background too 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.469
 I have been selected 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.859
 but it's the football that I buy a lot for the past 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.709
 I have to prove that every day, especially in the morning 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.430
 and that's always the big challenge because of you 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.080
 would like to play at pre-week level 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.199
 Heaven may be a question to Stampfli's prelude of the English them 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.889
 have also said that the angels do not know what they want 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.050
 wins in Sweden 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.400
 German played a bad game and won 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 yes that makes you a bit quiet 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.009
 So think that the Engener certainly with the favorites 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.610
 because they are a good cock crew with good singles 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.190
 Single players 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.469
 the percent 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.659
 a goal the only question mark is surely that one does not know 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.779
 Percent that their very good strikers make the sea with farmers and around Rooney 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.669
 all things 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.139
 They have not played for three months now, and it's not like that either 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.559
 easy as a player 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.339
 after a 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.369
 come back a little longer and immediately back to the level 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.639
 play what they intended 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.469
 short question has their position within the team through the new 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.730
 Role distribution also changed if you like me 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.390
 addressed, followed by young players now as goalkeeper number one 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.629
 unlike earlier ones 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.409
 No that's not the case of course we talk more about it 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.789
 the game situation in training and also in the game 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.479
 but then after the games 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.620
 most troops more in percent 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.860
 I think if my advice Dieter first to the coaches and now and then 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.220
 Hagen of course, what I have just said including game situation 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.479
 as we are now playing in the club around the idea the other game is used to 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.559
 to play that in their club 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.329
 but I think you should not take yourself too important and I say 

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:57.080
 this new constellation 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.850
 Percent has changed everything fundamentally now
