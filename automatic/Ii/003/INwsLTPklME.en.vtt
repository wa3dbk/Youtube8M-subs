00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.470
 I want to make a comment about a product that came out on the iphone that 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.660
 really liked it is an application called anonymous 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.709
 and that transforms 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.019
 current background in a mantle on a remote control as they say in Argentina 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 computer that in this case I have it here 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 project here then for example 8 degollado in books 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.149
 is looking for the library before the mac mini neal salon that is that magnitude 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 here he found 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.990
 put this song that I like a lot and that another maybe also likes that 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.710
 it's called the isi league 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.890
 of pilots 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.970
 I give to the song 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.720
 the fear of a little 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 but the residence 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.480
 now he's talking about all the virtues of marijuana that says it's 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.460
 good for the masses 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.220
 it is said to be good for tuberculosis 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 and now supports 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm going to show 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.410
 how you could do something like that 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.340
 with the fonera 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.650
 percent 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.210
 here I have a card that converts 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.360
 it was headquarters 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.770
 to sound 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.180
 sound that is can enter after going 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 so if I plugged this in 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 to the La Fonera 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 now I have the phone line plugged in with the card 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.350
 percent usbl sound then what are we doing 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.329
 in report is being pablo were written application for which one 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.280
 for example with one in that and very cute 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.800
 percent in any program using mac make a windows ovum you 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 outside choose different music programs 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.690
 i wrote nothing music through the fonera 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.729
 so 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.659
 the solution 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.079
 of course this from the iphone 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.239
 that solution that is there is very elegant but back are issues 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.899
 of 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.449
 of the post 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 percent really 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.590
 to do is all there is to have is an attached phone booth an amplifier 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.939
 and to do this 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.429
 must have 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:41.189
 a computer connected to heat price plus a carpet we are talking about 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.419
 more than a thousand euros of investment to do something that could be done for 49 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.889
 euros the fonera 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.079
 and without euros goals the sound card
