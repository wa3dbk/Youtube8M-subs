Techniques brush that I have I just use
it<00:05:44.930> as<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.140> would<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.590> all<00:05:45.740> over<00:05:45.980> bronzer

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
it as I would and all over bronzer

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.570 
it as I would and all over bronzer
rather<00:05:46.550> than<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.790> contour<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.510> this<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:48.310> 299<00:05:49.310> as

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
rather than a contour and this is 299 as

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.310 
rather than a contour and this is 299 as
well<00:05:49.820> so<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.060> get<00:05:50.210> three<00:05:50.419> shades<00:05:50.720> here<00:05:51.020> one<00:05:51.290> is

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
well so you get three shades here one is

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.770 
well so you get three shades here one is
a<00:05:51.470> light<00:05:51.770> highlight<00:05:52.520> shade<00:05:52.820> I<00:05:53.150> think<00:05:53.570> this<00:05:53.630> is

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
a light highlight shade I think this is

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.260 
a light highlight shade I think this is
your<00:05:53.960> blush<00:05:54.320> shade<00:05:54.350> which<00:05:54.980> is<00:05:55.190> actually<00:05:55.730> mat

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
your blush shade which is actually mat

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.200 
your blush shade which is actually mat
and<00:05:56.570> then<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.810> have<00:05:57.050> a<00:05:57.700> kind<00:05:58.700> of<00:05:58.760> shimmery

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
and then you have a kind of shimmery

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.590 
and then you have a kind of shimmery

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
nice trio they also have a primer which

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.070 
nice trio they also have a primer which
is<00:06:06.620> very<00:06:06.830> similar<00:06:07.220> to<00:06:07.430> oh<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.120> hate<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.750> squeaky

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
is very similar to oh I hate the squeaky

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.020 
is very similar to oh I hate the squeaky
sound<00:06:09.320> it's<00:06:09.710> very<00:06:09.890> similar<00:06:10.130> to<00:06:10.250> Urban<00:06:10.790> Decay's

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
sound it's very similar to Urban Decay's

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.170 
sound it's very similar to Urban Decay's
primer<00:06:11.060> potion<00:06:11.600> but<00:06:11.900> it's<00:06:12.050> not<00:06:12.260> as<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:14.000> doesn't

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
primer potion but it's not as it doesn't

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.180 
primer potion but it's not as it doesn't
dry<00:06:14.450> down<00:06:14.510> to<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.900> same<00:06:15.080> powdery<00:06:15.470> consistency

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
dry down to the same powdery consistency

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.860 
dry down to the same powdery consistency
that<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.400> think<00:06:16.790> Urban<00:06:17.150> Decay<00:06:17.360> primer<00:06:17.660> potion

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
that I think Urban Decay primer potion

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.830 
that I think Urban Decay primer potion
does<00:06:18.410> but<00:06:19.010> you<00:06:19.250> can<00:06:19.400> see<00:06:19.610> it's<00:06:19.940> just<00:06:20.480> it's<00:06:20.720> like

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
does but you can see it's just it's like

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.900 
does but you can see it's just it's like
a<00:06:20.870> nude<00:06:21.169> kind<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.710> cream<00:06:22.040> which<00:06:22.340> neut<00:06:22.760> is

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
a nude kind of cream which neut is

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.310 
a nude kind of cream which neut is
actually<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.390> shade<00:06:23.630> this<00:06:23.810> is<00:06:23.960> in<00:06:24.110> so<00:06:24.260> I

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
actually the shade this is in so I

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.960 
actually the shade this is in so I
wonder<00:06:24.590> if<00:06:24.680> they<00:06:24.770> have<00:06:24.800> other<00:06:25.100> finishes<00:06:25.760> as

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
wonder if they have other finishes as

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.730 
wonder if they have other finishes as
well<00:06:26.150> but<00:06:26.750> it's<00:06:26.930> just<00:06:27.050> a<00:06:27.110> very<00:06:27.290> basic<00:06:27.440> eye

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740
