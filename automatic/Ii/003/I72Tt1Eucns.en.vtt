00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.819
 jairo eduardo suÃ¡rez is a designer 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.950
 industrial that he found in guadua and 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.170
 natural fibers a good material 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.240
 to build bikes these 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 pedals already toured the city and the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 field 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.289
 is watching videos and moments 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.019
 I realized that there was a manufacturer of 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.180
 wooden wheels in italy that's it 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.009
 video and I took a bike video 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.899
 in bamboo by chance you know who 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.750
 He is arming a bike then why not 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.269
 assemble a frame in bamboo look what happens and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 Assemble an SUV that is in bamboo with 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.140
 I do not know how much 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.930
 I realized that there are many species 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
 hundreds of species of bamboo then the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 canned here to know how to choose the mango 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.740
 appropriate for the frame 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.650
 in the case of bamboo it can be dried with 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.890
 the water is cut it is made vinegar 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.600
 every 34 months what is needed and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 also the man can burn wants 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.120
 say that they take it green is cut and what 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.190
 what they do is burn it and that makes 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.950
 bamboo sugars dry and sealed 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.050
 and in a hardness that gives you a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.000
 structure to the bar and makes it 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.650
 much harder more resistant and that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 so I support a quantity with 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 Our raw material is basically 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.420
 so bamboo in this case is 45 millimeters 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 in diameter and goes for the tube 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.340
 bottom of the true frame for that tube 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.619
 which is top tube we use 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 around 35 38 millimeters too 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.960
 we use 22 25 millimeter rods 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
 for the lower triangle then of the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.620
 group outside forgiveness and for this part 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.600
 we use around 20 18 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.300
 after everything is one is that it is in the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.250
 matrix what we do is use fi 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.440
 yes that cross basically frays it 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.620
 let's go until we find like rolls of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.990
 34 millimeters and we tie it in all 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.990
 the unions to paste it with the next 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.230
 after 24 hours we remove the tape and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.940
 what we do is sanding and grinding 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.220
 until smooth student without removing much 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.410
 material so as not to lose resistance in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.630
 the joints once it's away from 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 clean frame we apply a lacquer 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.730
 polyurethane that gives this shine 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.760
 what it does is protect the bamboo from 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.100
 environment the advantage of bamboo in 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.250
 a frame because in fact it has three 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.750
 advantages once light as aluminum 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.190
 flexible as carbon and resistant 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.310
 like steel then these three 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.690
 advantages so to speak are combined and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.640
 what it does is that when you use 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.920
 Tendering feels very soft or is it 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 very rigid that is very stable but the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.640
 softness of the ground as it absorbs 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.650
 the bamboo then is very rich and is very 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.930
 pleasant on a bicycle the design of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.250
 the frames must first be seen for what 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.019
 the client wants it true for what 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.360
 the person wants if it is for mountain 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.580
 you have urban unemployment if you have suspension 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.580
 the type of wheels height 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.460
 depending also on the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.410
 anthropomorphic characteristics of the 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.390
 person, we look at how tall he is with the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.300
 distance as he sits on the bicycle 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.730
 and you take the measurements and we start 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.610
 design the framework the prices of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.120
 bicycles or the boot frame is 890 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.849
 thousand pesos without taxes 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.620
 and depending on the type of bike 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.709
 the components because the principle is 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.840
 assumable is 1,200,000 300 the weight of 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.459
 a bamboo frame is around 2 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.930
 kilos also depends on the fittings 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.970
 to be done in this case by we start 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.040
 handling the steering tube and the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.400
 center in chrome olio nails in steel 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.260
 and the tube that supports the seats in 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.120
 carbon fiber this makes the bicycle 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.579
 reach 2 kilos is relatively 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.870
 normal between quotation marks you can lower the 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.909
 weight using other components like 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.829
 aluminum and carbon fiber also the 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.510
 Weight the bicycle includes varies 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.340
 depending on the components 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.959
 obviously lighter components are 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.240
 much more expensive components like 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.800
 enzymes but then they have the post 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.930
 within the first ones that we have done 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.970
 of the bikes because they have gone up 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.830
 people up to 90 kilos 90 kilos 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.540
 Pasaditos and then there is no problem 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.200
 of twisting torsion that has been broken 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.200
 same element 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.710
 Bogota is very irregular in its 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.120
 land then selling those 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.220
 bicycles is that it's done a lot more 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.930
 smooth of walking is a very bicycle 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.210
 striking between many times they stop it 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.640
 you know, they ask me where is it from? 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.500
 does it weigh all those things 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.810
 so it 's very interesting then the subject 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.040
 because it is how it is very different from everything 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.440
 what in the market is needed in 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.730
 bamboo and the others also change the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.860
 mentality the people then that the mango 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.870
 endure and can reduce as much or more than 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.850
 a conventional aluminum bicycle or 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.800
 steel and titanium as the power 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.000
 get to have bike only 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.710
 setting up vouchers you can then 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.870
 obviously elements that are not achieved 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.000
 like wheel bearings and others 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.920
 although rim is I do not know when it was not yes 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.600
 you could by even develops the 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.640
 rudder develops the handlebar 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.860
 develop certain elements like that 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.110
 I think for this one I do not know 70 80 for 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.569
 discrete hundred could be done in them 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.779
 in bamboo wood natural fiber 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.029

 so several videos so you can see 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.610
 tests so that you see things that we have 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.999
 made with our instruments and 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.999
 bikes 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.780
 this has been all for today in the agenda 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.849
 and see you next Saturday at 10 and 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.259
 30 at night with more full stories 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.259
 of good night life 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.220
 but

 two
