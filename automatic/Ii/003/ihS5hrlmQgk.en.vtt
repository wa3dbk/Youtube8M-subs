00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.580
 the pilots have just taken off in two fighter planes in an attempt to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.830
 represent and test the air combat reported by Oscar Santamaría 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.830
 happened on Peru in 1980 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.060
 their pilots are now approximately 7 minutes away 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.259
 from the place of air combat 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.159
 we must keep our eyes wide open this airspace is not 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.159
 exclusively our 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.819
 to the surprise of santamaría 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.930
 recently declassified military documents 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.550
 show that a detailed report of the event was actually made 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.739
 after your experience 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.920
 the US defense ministry compiled all of its 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.399
 statement in a report and I wonder how you want the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.560
 they got 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.930
 I 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 cubadebate the air forces of both countries maintain a very close relationship 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 close with which they communicate all the time and in that way they found out 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.950
 despite the fact that the US government stopped investigators 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 in 1970 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.130
 with the closure of the blue book project 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.820
 the report of santamaría 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.760
 titled by the chiefs of staff our something different 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.310
 which we present here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.180
 for the first time on television 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.640
 this document was distributed between the ministry of defense the secretary 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.410
 of State 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.340
 the national security agency and the chair 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 the document is titled UFO applied in Peru the document clearly points 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.870
 that the source comes from a Peruvian air force officer who observed the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.550
 event 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.610
 the source reported that 1 was not sighted near an air force base 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.340
 Peru in southern Peru 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.950
 the Peruvian air force tried to intercept and destroy the children but 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.770
 was not successful this event reached the high mikelet the ministry of the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.620
 United States defense 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.829
 and remember 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.110
 but it is not new an ally of the United States at this time peru was a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.320
 ally of the Soviet Union during the cold war 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.680
 therefore little came to the highest echelons of the ministry of defense 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.309
 Óscar Santamaría received a copy of this document for the first time in 2001 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.249
 when the Peruvian air force made the world known to the first 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.510
 official investigation of a moment 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.969
 efe 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.349
 after studying dozens of cases the Peruvian air force decided that this 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.979
 was the most credible of the homicide cases solve in the history of the 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.359
 country 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.579
 the official response of the US government regarding 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.579
 this document 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.339
 we are in the area and we are ready to have the front 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.139
 the house planes arrived at their destination 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.449
 the fight is about to begin 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.779
 the former US Air Force test pilot the engineer 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:04.660
 Quílez Colón 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.939
 piloted the Santamaría aircraft and the UFO hunter z 4a 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.540
 will pilot the hosni aircraft and will try to maneuver like the UFO 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.559
 like santa maría they are in attack position 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.510
 santamaría claimed to have shot the UFO without getting any results afp 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.619
 then Santamaría said that the UFO stopped abruptly 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.459
 something impossible for any known aircraft because the incredible 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 g forces would kill the pilot 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.840
 at the moment ready to shoot 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.840
 get ready 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.120
 when the UFO aircraft brakes violently 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.639
 the Santamaría plane surpasses her 12 to see a collision 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:54.859
 even in this propeller aircraft the forces g of a violent braking 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.689
 they exert an unpleasant effect on the cameraman on board the fighter aircraft 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.089
 the cameraman is vomiting 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.919
 try to do it in the bag 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
 the team repeats this maneuver three times 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.969
 in one of the possibly most disturbing maneuvers ever invented by a 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:21.729
 pilot of the Peruvian air force Santamaría reached the maximum altitude 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.219
 for your aircraft 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.669
 19 millimeters while I was being chased by a UFO 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.610
 his life was at risk 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.729
 hey ball because it does not start until that's why I want 360 degrees to the left 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.389
 with a 45-degree tilt as well as regular when what starts at 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.520
 run vertically when we're ready with a pass back so the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.520
 male 15 cheerful us 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.289
 in the aircraft of Santamaría Benítez identified 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 In 2009 Biden made an almost vertical ascent maneuver 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.490
 the UFO the next attempt also ascend in vertical 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.240
 to ground in vertical 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.120
 and good bye 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 we can not reach them 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.740
 what they have just demonstrated is that there is no way for an aircraft made by the 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.259
 man 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.740
 can accelerate from zero to one thousand 600 kilometers per hour at that altitude in a 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.050
 instant 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.970
 also shows that none of the best fighter pilots of that era 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.999
 I could have made it 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.490
 let's go home 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.490
 the ball took the lead ready to resume the flight plan 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.129
 I trust that it was found that we last October variant 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.479
 the UFO had its chance 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.760
 another one that always have a chance 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.770
 tonight I talked I think that beat and if the UFO could attend to that 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.440
 speed would not have imported the silver veron bird it would seem that I was not 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.819
 playing with him 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.070
 to find that inside the aircraft and try to copy or imitate those maneuvers 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.260
 you realize that it is impossible for an aircraft manufactured by man 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.040
 could have carried out these maneuvers carried out by the west 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.110
 said the colonel is lying or it is a class of objects that 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.719
 definitely what he has manufactured by man and that demands of all 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.460
 flight forms of anything known on earth 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.349
 the team meets again next to the map to discuss the results of their 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.229
 test flights 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.000
 can not be worth less once we have just piloted vertical farms 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.110
 beatriz of an aircraft that was not able to give that way 4 0 ship is removed that 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.550
 can attend vertically at supersonic speed 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.440
 there are many that can do it as a completed propulsion force 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.710
 nevertheless never from a dead point with respect to the output speed what 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.580
 that draws attention with respect to this story is the speed and 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.600
 maneuverability this object stops ascends vertically in the instance 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.840
 federal in the air and the cold and weak wind of the key that we can 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.680
 do 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.520
 getting into combat with a man tried 20 minute period is something really 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.039
 extraordinary I mean it's likely to see it saved for a few moments and 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.780
 not be able to identify it but being able to enter combat for 20 minutes is 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.780
 a totally incredible situation 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.309
 two cases 

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:33.379
 two respectable pilots 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.599
 two series of declassified official documents that show that these 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.599
 cases came to the hands of the highest governmental levels 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.370
 and what about the other cases of aerial combats with UFOs that still 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.449
 they have not been reported
