merchant items it's not like the small
step<00:00:10.290> line<00:00:10.530> because<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.190> have<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.519> actually

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
step line because you have to actually

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.360 
step line because you have to actually
think<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.389> yourself<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.990> I'll<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.769> try<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
think of it yourself so I'll just try to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.150 
think of it yourself so I'll just try to
show<00:00:14.759> some<00:00:15.120> easy<00:00:15.360> methods<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:16.590> starting<00:00:17.010> with

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
show some easy methods I'm starting with

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.820 
show some easy methods I'm starting with
rawhide<00:00:17.490> lettuce<00:00:18.060> sections<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.690> saw<00:00:19.590> these

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
rawhide lettuce sections I saw these

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.080 
rawhide lettuce sections I saw these
were<00:00:20.070> 10<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.210> buy<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> 13<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.500> sell<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.939> soon

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
were 10 to buy and 13 to sell so as soon

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
were 10 to buy and 13 to sell so as soon
as<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.359> item<00:00:24.480> has<00:00:25.140> more<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.560> ten<00:00:25.830> percent

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
as an item has more than ten percent

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.970 
as an item has more than ten percent
difference<00:00:26.460> between<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.320> then<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.769> try

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
difference between it then you can try

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
difference between it then you can try
and<00:00:29.039> merchant<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.240> depends<00:00:30.810> on

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and merchant it but it also depends on

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.670 
and merchant it but it also depends on
like<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.219> price<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> item<00:00:33.230> just<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.530> give
