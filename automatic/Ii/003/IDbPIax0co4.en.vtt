yeah yeah good you have a dual portal
device<00:00:10.019> there<00:00:10.650> should<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> way<00:00:11.219> back<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
device there should be a way back to the

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.369 
device there should be a way back to the
testing<00:00:12.209> area<00:00:12.360> up<00:00:12.780> ahead

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
testing area up ahead

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.410 
testing area up ahead
once<00:00:13.709> testing<00:00:14.219> starts<00:00:14.670> I'm<00:00:14.879> required<00:00:15.299> by

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
once testing starts I'm required by

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.870 
once testing starts I'm required by
protocol<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.410> keep<00:00:16.619> interaction<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> to

little tricks so there's nothing to stop
us<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.500> testing<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> rest<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.660> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
us from testing for the rest of your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.160 
us from testing for the rest of your
life

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.170 

federal<00:01:19.170> regulations<00:01:19.770> require<00:01:20.130> me<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.940> warn

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
federal regulations require me to warn

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.260 
federal regulations require me to warn
you<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.690> next<00:01:21.960> test<00:01:22.080> chamber<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
you that this next test chamber is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.470 
you that this next test chamber is
looking<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.840> good<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> right

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
looking pretty good that's right

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.570 
looking pretty good that's right
the<00:01:27.810> facility<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.590> completely<00:01:29.280> operational

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
the facility is completely operational

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:58.790 
the facility is completely operational
again

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100 

I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.640> these<00:01:59.760> test<00:02:00.090> chambers<00:02:00.570> look<00:02:00.750> even

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I think these test chambers look even

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.470 
I think these test chambers look even
better<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.650> they<00:02:01.800> did<00:02:01.860> before<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.270> easy

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
better than they did before it was easy

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.600 
better than they did before it was easy
really<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.830> have<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.160> look<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.490> things

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
really you just have to look at things

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.730 
really you just have to look at things
objectively<00:02:05.960> see<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.260> don't<00:02:07.470> need

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
objectively see what you don't need

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.450 
objectively see what you don't need
anymore

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
anymore

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.960 
anymore
and<00:02:08.550> trim<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> fat
