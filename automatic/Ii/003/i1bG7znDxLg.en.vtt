00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
string but we're gonna kind of slide

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.020 
string but we're gonna kind of slide
into<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.500> note<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.920> this<00:00:52.489> is<00:00:52.610> how<00:00:52.729> it's<00:00:52.970> gonna

into the note and this is how it's gonna
sound<00:00:53.390> I'll<00:00:53.750> play<00:00:54.019> it<00:00:54.110> slow<00:00:54.350> now<00:01:02.890> what<00:01:03.890> I'm

sound I'll play it slow now what I'm

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.160 
sound I'll play it slow now what I'm
doing<00:01:04.309> on<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.759> I'm<00:01:04.879> using<00:01:05.299> notes<00:01:05.540> from

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
doing on this is I'm using notes from

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.380 
doing on this is I'm using notes from
the<00:01:06.320> from<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:06.950> mixolydian<00:01:07.610> scale<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.299> I'm

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
the from the a mixolydian scale but I'm

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.480 
the from the a mixolydian scale but I'm
kind<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.689> sliding<00:01:09.170> from<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.830> minor<00:01:10.100> 3rd<00:01:10.460> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
kind of sliding from that minor 3rd to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.179 
kind of sliding from that minor 3rd to
the<00:01:10.820> major<00:01:11.030> 3rd<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.659> hear<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.020> sound

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.350 

that<00:01:16.189> little<00:01:16.460> slide<00:01:16.729> that's<00:01:17.090> very

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
that little slide that's very

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.630 
that little slide that's very
characteristic<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.710> mixolydian<00:01:19.040> sound

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
characteristic of the mixolydian sound

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.850 
characteristic of the mixolydian sound
it's<00:01:19.909> where<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.150> use<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.570> minor<00:01:20.869> major<00:01:21.200> a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
it's where you use that minor major a

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.740 
it's where you use that minor major a
little<00:01:22.130> transition<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.329> it<00:01:23.450> gives<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.720> a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
little transition and it gives it a

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.910 
little transition and it gives it a
bluesy<00:01:24.140> sound<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.590> then<00:01:24.680> we're<00:01:24.770> going<00:01:24.860> to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
bluesy sound and then we're going to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.859 
bluesy sound and then we're going to
move<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.400> half<00:01:25.670> step<00:01:25.939> Bend<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.479> then

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
move up to a half step Bend and then

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.510 
move up to a half step Bend and then
when<00:01:26.990> we<00:01:27.079> come<00:01:27.229> back<00:01:27.409> down<00:01:27.679> again<00:01:27.740> we're<00:01:28.460> gonna

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
when we come back down again we're gonna

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.010 
when we come back down again we're gonna
hit<00:01:28.789> that<00:01:28.819> little<00:01:29.030> half<00:01:29.299> step<00:01:29.569> so<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.810> sounds

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
hit that little half step so it sounds

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
hit that little half step so it sounds
like<00:01:30.049> this

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.760 

so<00:01:37.479> when<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.689> drop<00:01:37.930> down<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.439> second

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
so when you drop down to that second

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.960 
so when you drop down to that second
finger<00:01:38.860> you're<00:01:39.070> kind<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.280> bending<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.729> up<00:01:39.790> to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
finger you're kind of bending it up to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.550 
finger you're kind of bending it up to
the<00:01:40.060> major<00:01:40.240> third<00:01:40.540> again<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.080> we'll<00:01:41.229> try<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.439> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the major third again so we'll try it a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:52.530 
the major third again so we'll try it a
little<00:01:41.590> faster<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.299> that's<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
little faster all right so that's the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.249 
little faster all right so that's the
first<00:01:52.720> one

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
first one

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.289 
first one
now<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.890> next<00:01:54.220> mixolydian<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.940> want<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.149> show

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
now the next mixolydian I want to show

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.910 
now the next mixolydian I want to show
you<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.600> gonna<00:01:55.750> be<00:01:55.810> down<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.350> fifth<00:01:56.619> fret

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
you is gonna be down on the fifth fret

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.730 
you is gonna be down on the fifth fret
this<00:01:57.640> one<00:01:57.909> has<00:01:58.180> kind<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.570> funky<00:01:59.020> sound<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.560> it

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
this one has kind of a funky sound to it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.980 
this one has kind of a funky sound to it
and<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.369> way<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:00.909> pattern<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.750> it

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and the way that this pattern is is it

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.690 
and the way that this pattern is is it
doesn't<00:02:02.440> actually<00:02:02.710> use<00:02:02.830> all<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.310> notes<00:02:03.520> in

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
doesn't actually use all the notes in

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.520 
doesn't actually use all the notes in
the<00:02:03.729> scale<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.180> kind<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.390> jumps<00:02:04.690> around<00:02:04.780> which

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the scale it kind of jumps around which

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.050 
the scale it kind of jumps around which
gives<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.369> special<00:02:06.819> sort<00:02:07.000> of

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
gives it that that special sort of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.639 
gives it that that special sort of
mixolydian<00:02:07.450> sound<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.140> I'll<00:02:08.229> play<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.410> real

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
mixolydian sound so I'll play it real

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:21.250 
mixolydian sound so I'll play it real
slow<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.310> that's<00:02:09.700> gonna<00:02:09.819> go<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.119> this

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.440 

so<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> do<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.830> slide<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.670> last<00:02:22.880> note<00:02:23.180> I'll

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
so I do a slide to the last note I'll

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.770 
so I do a slide to the last note I'll

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
fret and we're gonna actually come off

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
fret and we're gonna actually come off
from<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> 17th<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.109> 12th<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.799> then<00:02:59.159> move

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
from the 17th to the 12th and then move

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.309 
from the 17th to the 12th and then move
to<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.549> 14th<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.599> second<00:03:00.959> string<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:01.230> it's

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
to the 14th on the second string so it's

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.949 
to the 14th on the second string so it's
gonna<00:03:01.439> sound<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:03.650> like<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:05.840> then<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
gonna sound like this like that then the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.470 
gonna sound like this like that then the
next<00:03:07.109> part<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.650> goes<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.069> 15th<00:03:08.760> fret<00:03:09.000> with

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
next part it goes to the 15th fret with

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.789 
next part it goes to the 15th fret with
the<00:03:09.569> same<00:03:09.780> two<00:03:09.989> bottom<00:03:10.319> note<00:03:10.469> so<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.709> gonna

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the same two bottom note so it's gonna

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:19.020 
the same two bottom note so it's gonna
sound<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.129> this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.490 

and<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:20.990> we<00:03:21.080> go<00:03:21.170> down<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.500> scale<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
and then we go down the scale so the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:36.080 
and then we go down the scale so the
whole<00:03:27.620> thing<00:03:27.830> sounds<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.160> this

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:45.650 

a<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:38.200> faster

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.630 

so<00:03:46.660> there's<00:03:46.900> three<00:03:47.470> mixolydian<00:03:47.950> patterns

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
so there's three mixolydian patterns

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.760 
so there's three mixolydian patterns
that<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.120> try<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.260> want<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.500> put<00:03:50.650> on

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
that you can try and I want to put on

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.350 
that you can try and I want to put on
the<00:03:50.920> track<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.340> we<00:03:51.460> created<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.150> you

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
the track that we created just for you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.910 
the track that we created just for you
with<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> mixolydian<00:03:52.990> on<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.890> can

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
with the mixolydian on it so you can

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:32.780 
with the mixolydian on it so you can
hear<00:03:54.160> how<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.370> sounds

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:46.370 

travel<00:04:33.780> time<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.230> one

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:56.429 

317

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:24.800 

again

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.240 

all<00:05:25.810> right<00:05:25.990> so<00:05:26.319> there's<00:05:26.500> three<00:05:26.800> mixolydian

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
all right so there's three mixolydian

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.059 
all right so there's three mixolydian
rifts<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.270> can<00:05:28.419> try<00:05:28.689> along<00:05:29.409> to<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.710> backing

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
rifts you can try along to the backing

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.760 
rifts you can try along to the backing
track<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:30.550> again<00:05:31.300> learn<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.110> other<00:05:32.259> patterns

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
track and again learn the other patterns

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.170 
track and again learn the other patterns
all<00:05:32.949> over<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.280> neck<00:05:33.460> it's<00:05:33.610> going<00:05:33.729> to<00:05:33.789> open<00:05:34.060> up

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
all over the neck it's going to open up

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.059 
all over the neck it's going to open up
so<00:05:34.479> many<00:05:34.599> ideas<00:05:34.780> for<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.259> for<00:05:35.800> your<00:05:35.919> own

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
so many ideas for you for your own

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.840 
so many ideas for you for your own
thoughts<00:05:36.340> so<00:05:36.580> have<00:05:37.090> fun<00:05:37.300> with<00:05:37.360> mixolydian
