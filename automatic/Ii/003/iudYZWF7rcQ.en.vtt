00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
case okay now I don't know which one

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.290 
case okay now I don't know which one
specifically<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.140> main<00:02:21.319> disk<00:02:21.709> on<00:02:22.300> there

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
specifically is the main disk on there

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.750 
specifically is the main disk on there
are<00:02:23.420> two<00:02:23.599> blu-ray<00:02:23.870> discs<00:02:24.530> one<00:02:25.310> has<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
are two blu-ray discs one has the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.710 
are two blu-ray discs one has the
special<00:02:26.030> features<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:28.120> game<00:02:29.120> demo<00:02:29.540> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
special features and the game demo and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
special features and the game demo and
all<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.040> I'm<00:02:31.130> assuming<00:02:31.459> that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
all that on it and I'm assuming that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
all that on it and I'm assuming that
would<00:02:31.910> be<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:32.959> generally<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
would be this one because generally the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.220 
would be this one because generally the
first<00:02:33.950> blu-ray<00:02:34.250> disc<00:02:34.610> when<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.910> open<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
first blu-ray disc when you open is the
