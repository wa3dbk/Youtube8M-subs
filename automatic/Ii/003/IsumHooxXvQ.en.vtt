00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
reloading systems but as far as I've

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
reloading systems but as far as I've
found<00:00:50.700> they're<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.059> absolutely<00:00:51.780> massive

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

they could take hours to build they use

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
they could take hours to build they use
a<00:00:54.210> ton<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> resources<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.920> aren't

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
great as a starting option in something

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
great as a starting option in something
like<00:00:58.079> survival<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> year<00:00:59.969> ago<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
like survival so about a year ago I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
like survival so about a year ago I
started<00:01:01.079> trying<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> design<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> compact<00:01:02.609> tnt

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
started trying to design a compact tnt

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
started trying to design a compact tnt
cannon<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.600> automatically<00:01:04.199> reloads<00:01:04.860> itself

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
cannon that automatically reloads itself

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
cannon that automatically reloads itself
and<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> result<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> wolf<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> 5

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and the result is the wolf this is a 5

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
and the result is the wolf this is a 5
by<00:01:07.830> 5<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.549> 5<00:01:08.790> blocks<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:09.390> say<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.720> about

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
by 5 by 5 blocks might say that's about

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.410 
by 5 by 5 blocks might say that's about
as<00:01:10.140> small<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> gets<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> the

it shortly but first let's go over the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.330 
it shortly but first let's go over the
details<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> cannon<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> wolf<00:01:28.650> uses<00:01:29.070> two

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
details of the cannon the wolf uses two

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
details of the cannon the wolf uses two
charges<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.509> shot<00:01:30.900> which<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.200> nothing

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
charges for one shot which is nothing

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580 
charges for one shot which is nothing
amazing<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:33.030> has<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> decent<00:01:33.570> range<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.259> 30<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
amazing it has a decent range of 30 to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
amazing it has a decent range of 30 to
35<00:01:35.159> meters<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.630> an

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
35 meters but it's also got an

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
35 meters but it's also got an
impressive<00:01:37.170> speed<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> 20<00:01:38.400> rounds<00:01:38.759> per<00:01:38.970> minute

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
impressive speed of 20 rounds per minute

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
impressive speed of 20 rounds per minute
which<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.900> quick<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> single<00:01:40.979> barrel

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
which is quick for a single barrel

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
which is quick for a single barrel
cannon<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.450> function<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.840> both

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
cannon and it can function in both

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
cannon and it can function in both
semi-automatic<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.829> fully<00:01:43.890> automatic<00:01:44.399> modes

of course and it uses a rail and hopper
system<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> distribute<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> TNT<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
system to distribute the TNT into all of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.319 
system to distribute the TNT into all of
the<00:01:49.560> dispensers<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.700> means<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.180> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the dispensers which means you can just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
the dispensers which means you can just
drop<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> stack<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> TNT<00:01:52.320> into<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.860> chest<00:01:53.220> give

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
drop a stack of TNT into this chest give

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
drop a stack of TNT into this chest give
it<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> few<00:01:54.090> seconds<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it a few seconds to get into the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
it a few seconds to get into the
minecart<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> either<00:01:56.430> hit<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.240 
minecart then you can either hit this
button<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> fire<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> once<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.100> can

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.609 
tnt cannon one you're limited in charge
power<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> lot<00:02:10.590> of

it will still break the minecarts for

it will still break the minecarts for
some<00:02:16.140> reason<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.069> how<00:02:17.190> minecraft

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
some reason that's just how minecraft

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.699 
some reason that's just how minecraft
works<00:02:17.910> unfortunately<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> other

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
works unfortunately and the other

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.490 
works unfortunately and the other
problem<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.879> don't<00:02:21.090> usually<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.900> an<00:02:22.080> even

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
problem is you don't usually get an even

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.589 
problem is you don't usually get an even
distribution<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> TNT<00:02:23.819> throughout<00:02:24.360> your

distribution of the TNT throughout your

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.600 
distribution of the TNT throughout your
dispensers<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.319> don't<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.860> why<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.400> just

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
dispensers I don't know why it just

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.119 
dispensers I don't know why it just
doesn't<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.989> order<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> level<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
doesn't so in order to get the level of

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.979 
doesn't so in order to get the level of
convenience<00:02:29.430> necessary<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.330> regards<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.810> the

size<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> wolf<00:02:31.739> we<00:02:32.549> had<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.000> sacrifice

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
size of the wolf we had to sacrifice

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.839 
size of the wolf we had to sacrifice
some<00:02:33.840> reliability<00:02:34.379> however<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.549> it's

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
some reliability however if it's

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.089 
some reliability however if it's
functionality<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.290> simplicity

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
functionality you want and simplicity

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.400 
functionality you want and simplicity
and<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:39.060> course<00:02:39.239> if<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> have<00:02:39.629> enough<00:02:39.900> TNT<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and of course if you have enough TNT to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130 
and of course if you have enough TNT to
waste<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.760> cannon<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.299> so

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
waste then this is the cannon for you so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.069 
waste then this is the cannon for you so
let's<00:02:43.410> go<00:02:43.530> ahead<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.010> start<00:02:44.400> building<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
let's go ahead and start building so to

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.080 
let's go ahead and start building so to
make<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.349> smallest<00:02:46.650> auto<00:02:47.010> reloading<00:02:47.640> tnt

something<00:03:25.109> we<00:03:25.350> need<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.650> lot<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.280> i'll

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
something we need a lot of and i'll

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.970 
something we need a lot of and i'll
explain<00:03:26.910> why<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.319> go<00:03:28.440> around<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.829> back

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
explain why and we go around to the back

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.890 
explain why and we go around to the back
you'll<00:03:29.790> notice<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.269> I've<00:03:30.420> replaced<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
you'll notice that I've replaced the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900 
you'll notice that I've replaced the
back<00:03:31.139> charge<00:03:31.500> dispenser<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> standard

course<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.370> diamond<00:03:35.670> blocks<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.000> show<00:03:36.299> what

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
course the diamond blocks just show what

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.390 
course the diamond blocks just show what
changes<00:03:37.170> I've<00:03:37.260> made<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.620> each<00:03:37.829> stage<00:03:38.160> of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
changes I've made with each stage of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.030 
changes I've made with each stage of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
development so I'm you can use anything

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.069 
development so I'm you can use anything

won't a solid block sorry the reason we

won't a solid block sorry the reason we

original model worked with a push of a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.680 
original model worked with a push of a
button<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.919> we<00:04:05.220> want<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.639> redstone<00:04:06.120> circuit<00:04:06.540> so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
button and we want a redstone circuit so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.809 
button and we want a redstone circuit so
each<00:04:06.840> dispenser<00:04:07.230> now<00:04:07.560> has<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.980> repeater<00:04:08.280> the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
each dispenser now has a repeater the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.909 
each dispenser now has a repeater the
two<00:04:08.970> charges<00:04:09.450> are<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.169> default<00:04:10.560> setting

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
two charges are on the default setting

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.729 
two charges are on the default setting
of<00:04:11.069> one<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.720> one<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.049> shot<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.530> on

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
of one and the one for the shot is on

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.400 
of one and the one for the shot is on
the<00:04:13.950> longest<00:04:14.340> setting<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.849> four<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.349> is

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
the longest setting of four this is

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.440 
the longest setting of four this is
because<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> slight<00:04:17.400> increase<00:04:17.669> in<00:04:18.000> delay

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
because the slight increase in delay

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.750 
because the slight increase in delay
between<00:04:18.690> charge<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.470> shot<00:04:19.709> detonation<00:04:20.310> will

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
between charge and shot detonation will

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.670 
between charge and shot detonation will
allow<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.090> projectile<00:04:21.719> to<00:04:21.750> travel<00:04:22.260> just<00:04:22.289> a

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
allow the projectile to travel just a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.680 
allow the projectile to travel just a
few<00:04:22.950> blocks<00:04:23.130> further<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.210> little<00:04:24.479> more

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
few blocks further so a little more

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.370 
few blocks further so a little more
distance<00:04:24.930> there<00:04:25.289> as<00:04:25.409> well

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
distance there as well

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.560 
distance there as well
once<00:04:27.040> our<00:04:27.190> mods<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.760> base<00:04:27.910> design<00:04:28.210> are<00:04:28.390> done

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
once our mods the base design are done

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.150 
once our mods the base design are done
let's<00:04:28.930> move<00:04:29.140> on<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.470> next<00:04:29.650> stage<00:04:29.920> which<00:04:30.130> is

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
let's move on to the next stage which is

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.430 
let's move on to the next stage which is
to<00:04:30.460> start<00:04:30.850> hooking<00:04:31.030> up<00:04:31.360> our<00:04:31.510> reloading<00:04:32.110> system

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
to start hooking up our reloading system

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.100 
to start hooking up our reloading system
here<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.700> put<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.090> for<00:04:34.480> hoppers<00:04:34.780> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
here I have put in for hoppers to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.880 
here I have put in for hoppers to
connect<00:04:35.410> all<00:04:35.590> three<00:04:35.980> dispensers<00:04:36.610> as<00:04:36.760> shown

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
connect all three dispensers as shown

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.340 
connect all three dispensers as shown
and<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.850> diamond<00:04:40.150> blocks<00:04:40.330> up<00:04:40.540> here<00:04:40.810> are<00:04:41.110> just

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
and the diamond blocks up here are just

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.170 
and the diamond blocks up here are just
to<00:04:41.440> show<00:04:41.620> where<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.890> rails<00:04:42.130> are<00:04:42.550> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:43.030> go

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
to show where the rails are going to go

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.790 
to show where the rails are going to go
in<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.720> next<00:04:43.840> step<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.920> two<00:04:45.100> down<00:04:45.460> here

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
in the next step and the two down here

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.380 
in the next step and the two down here
these<00:04:47.800> are<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.370> extend<00:04:48.670> our<00:04:48.880> circuit<00:04:49.270> so

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
these are just to extend our circuit so

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.970 
these are just to extend our circuit so
we're<00:04:49.540> going<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.720> put<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> redstone<00:04:50.290> dust<00:04:50.680> on

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
we're going to put a redstone dust on

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.420 
we're going to put a redstone dust on
each<00:04:51.190> one<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.520> those<00:04:52.200> now<00:04:53.200> stage<00:04:53.440> four<00:04:53.830> let<00:04:54.370> me

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
each one of those now stage four let me

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.310 
each one of those now stage four let me
just<00:04:54.610> set<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.880> day<00:04:55.210> time<00:04:57.090> there<00:04:58.090> we<00:04:58.180> go<00:04:58.300> okay

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
just set it day time there we go okay

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.190 
just set it day time there we go okay
Stage<00:04:59.680> four<00:04:59.980> over<00:05:00.340> here<00:05:00.640> this<00:05:00.910> shows<00:05:01.180> all<00:05:01.690> our

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
Stage four over here this shows all our

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.260 
Stage four over here this shows all our
rails<00:05:02.470> they're<00:05:02.800> going<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.190> u-shape<00:05:03.820> we've

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
rails they're going in a u-shape we've

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.140 
rails they're going in a u-shape we've
got<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.510> powered<00:05:04.930> rail<00:05:04.960> at<00:05:05.380> each<00:05:05.770> end<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.520> a

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
got a powered rail at each end and a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.140 
got a powered rail at each end and a
detector<00:05:07.750> rail<00:05:07.930> at<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:08.230> far<00:05:08.740> end<00:05:08.980> so<00:05:09.340> your

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
detector rail at the far end so your

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.050 
detector rail at the far end so your
cart<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.690> going<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.230> start<00:05:11.530> over<00:05:11.770> here<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.490> this

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
cart is going to start over here on this

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.360 
cart is going to start over here on this
side<00:05:13.440> now<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.500> can<00:05:14.710> kind<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:14.980> see<00:05:15.160> how<00:05:15.340> it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
side now you can kind of see how it

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.120 
side now you can kind of see how it
works<00:05:15.670> now<00:05:15.930> with<00:05:16.930> one<00:05:17.140> shot<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.500> cart<00:05:17.920> will

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
works now with one shot the cart will

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.670 
works now with one shot the cart will
set<00:05:18.370> off<00:05:18.520> from<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.090> powered<00:05:19.480> rail<00:05:19.690> load<00:05:20.530> the

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
set off from this powered rail load the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.070 
set off from this powered rail load the
TNT<00:05:21.130> by<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:21.430> hoppers<00:05:22.000> hit<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.870> detector

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
TNT by the hoppers hit the detector

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.050 
TNT by the hoppers hit the detector
which<00:05:23.710> will<00:05:23.980> set<00:05:24.280> off<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> firing<00:05:24.760> sequence

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
which will set off the firing sequence

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.290 
which will set off the firing sequence
and<00:05:25.630> then<00:05:25.990> also<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:27.010> activator<00:05:27.520> rail<00:05:27.790> which

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
and then also this activator rail which

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.970 
and then also this activator rail which
will<00:05:28.450> then<00:05:28.600> send<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:29.020> all<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.260> way<00:05:29.470> back<00:05:29.710> round

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
will then send it all the way back round

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.380 
will then send it all the way back round
to<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.220> start<00:05:30.460> now<00:05:30.640> as<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.000> mentioned<00:05:31.330> before

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
to the start now as I mentioned before

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.500 
to the start now as I mentioned before
you<00:05:31.990> aren't<00:05:32.380> guaranteed<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:33.510> even

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
you aren't guaranteed and it's even

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.840 
you aren't guaranteed and it's even
distribution<00:05:34.810> with<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.350> cart<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.190> sending<00:05:36.730> the

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
distribution with a cart so sending the

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.090 
distribution with a cart so sending the
whole<00:05:37.000> thing<00:05:37.270> over<00:05:37.630> each<00:05:37.840> hopper<00:05:38.230> twice<00:05:38.620> means

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
whole thing over each hopper twice means

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.620 
whole thing over each hopper twice means
you'll<00:05:39.310> have<00:05:39.430> more<00:05:39.820> than<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:40.060> dispensers

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
you'll have more than the dispensers

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.450 
you'll have more than the dispensers
than<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.260> should<00:05:41.320> have<00:05:41.560> for<00:05:41.980> each<00:05:42.100> time<00:05:42.340> you

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
than you should have for each time you

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.160 
than you should have for each time you
fired<00:05:42.670> the<00:05:42.820> cannon<00:05:42.940> but<00:05:43.720> it<00:05:43.870> doesn't<00:05:44.080> really

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
fired the cannon but it doesn't really

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.810 
fired the cannon but it doesn't really
matter<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:44.530> can<00:05:44.950> still<00:05:45.220> use<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.550> up<00:05:45.670> by

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
matter you can still use it up by

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.550 
matter you can still use it up by
sending<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.360> card<00:05:46.570> more<00:05:46.930> times<00:05:47.200> even<00:05:47.470> when

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
sending the card more times even when

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.440 
sending the card more times even when
it's<00:05:47.770> empty<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.760> don't<00:05:48.940> have<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.210> worry

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
it's empty and you don't have to worry

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.810 
it's empty and you don't have to worry
about<00:05:49.540> like<00:05:50.080> accidentally<00:05:50.770> dispensing<00:05:51.760> a

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
about like accidentally dispensing a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.700 
about like accidentally dispensing a
shot<00:05:52.060> without<00:05:52.240> any<00:05:52.510> charge<00:05:52.870> which<00:05:53.230> means<00:05:53.560> you

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
shot without any charge which means you

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.030 
shot without any charge which means you
risk<00:05:53.980> damaging<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.460> cannon<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:55.740> stage<00:05:56.740> 5

we've<00:05:57.460> completed<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.210> reloading<00:05:58.570> mechanism

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
we've completed the reloading mechanism

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.830 
we've completed the reloading mechanism
by<00:05:59.380> simply<00:05:59.860> connecting<00:06:00.130> a<00:06:00.460> hopper<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.660> the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
by simply connecting a hopper to the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.420 
by simply connecting a hopper to the
starting<00:06:02.260> powered<00:06:02.590> rail<00:06:02.770> as<00:06:02.950> you<00:06:03.070> can<00:06:03.250> see

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
starting powered rail as you can see

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.550 
starting powered rail as you can see
there<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:04.330> then<00:06:04.540> just<00:06:04.630> shoving<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.080> chest<00:06:05.350> on

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
there and then just shoving a chest on

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.970 
there and then just shoving a chest on
top<00:06:05.590> simple<00:06:06.220> enough<00:06:06.960> finally<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.560> last<00:06:08.740> thing

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
top simple enough finally the last thing

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.460 
top simple enough finally the last thing
to<00:06:09.100> do<00:06:09.220> is<00:06:09.490> to<00:06:09.730> set<00:06:09.910> up<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:10.240> trigger<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:11.230> now

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
to do is to set up a trigger and now

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.650 
to do is to set up a trigger and now
I've<00:06:11.590> built<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.980> standing<00:06:12.790> platform<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.510> of

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
I've built a standing platform out of

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.080 
I've built a standing platform out of
wood<00:06:13.840> here<00:06:14.230> and<00:06:14.350> this<00:06:15.190> bit<00:06:15.520> doesn't<00:06:15.880> count

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
wood here and this bit doesn't count

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.870 
wood here and this bit doesn't count
it's<00:06:16.270> still<00:06:16.450> a<00:06:16.480> 5<00:06:16.720> by<00:06:16.870> 5<00:06:17.050> by<00:06:17.260> 5<00:06:17.470> because<00:06:18.400> this<00:06:18.670> is

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
it's still a 5 by 5 by 5 because this is

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.900 
it's still a 5 by 5 by 5 because this is
not<00:06:19.090> mandatory<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.110> main<00:06:20.530> operation<00:06:21.160> but

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
not mandatory to the main operation but

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.290 
not mandatory to the main operation but
yeah<00:06:23.100> this<00:06:24.100> redstone<00:06:24.610> here<00:06:24.640> this<00:06:24.970> is<00:06:25.120> really

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
yeah this redstone here this is really

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.360 
yeah this redstone here this is really
just<00:06:25.450> optional<00:06:26.020> you<00:06:26.200> can<00:06:26.470> of<00:06:26.710> course<00:06:26.920> just<00:06:27.010> put

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
just optional you can of course just put

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.360 
just optional you can of course just put
button<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.360> lever<00:06:28.660> over<00:06:28.930> on<00:06:29.560> this<00:06:30.040> block

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
button and lever over on this block

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.220 
button and lever over on this block
instead<00:06:31.180> and<00:06:31.420> it<00:06:31.510> will<00:06:31.630> work<00:06:31.810> just<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.200> same

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
instead and it will work just the same

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.710 
instead and it will work just the same
without<00:06:33.040> having<00:06:33.490> this<00:06:33.880> stuff<00:06:34.210> visible<00:06:34.600> on<00:06:34.660> top

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
without having this stuff visible on top

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560 
without having this stuff visible on top
but<00:06:35.470> I<00:06:35.680> like<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.220> symmetry<00:06:36.460> of<00:06:36.700> it<00:06:36.880> like<00:06:37.330> this

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
but I like the symmetry of it like this

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.600 
but I like the symmetry of it like this
because<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.140> have<00:06:38.320> your<00:06:38.650> loading<00:06:39.100> chest<00:06:39.370> up

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
because you have your loading chest up

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
because you have your loading chest up
here

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630

sequence<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.190> only<00:06:45.460> really<00:06:46.120> need<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.960> power

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
sequence you only really need to power

at this activator rail down here so you

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.150 
at this activator rail down here so you

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
could move the trigger somewhere

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.330 
could move the trigger somewhere
completely<00:06:51.370> off<00:06:51.790> site<00:06:51.970> if<00:06:52.120> you<00:06:52.210> wanted<00:06:52.419> to<00:06:52.570> and
