00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
markers like as you can see like when i

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.540 
markers like as you can see like when i
got<00:02:52.350> these<00:02:52.530> i'm<00:02:52.800> not<00:02:52.950> sure<00:02:53.070> it's<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> different

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550

color<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.030> when<00:02:54.120> i<00:02:54.180> got<00:02:54.300> these<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.540> first

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
color that but when i got these at first

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.170 
color that but when i got these at first
you<00:02:55.050> didn't<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.430> exact<00:02:56.430> right<00:02:56.700> color<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
you didn't have the exact right color to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.000 
you didn't have the exact right color to
make<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.420> Chikorita<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.440> he<00:02:58.590> ended<00:02:58.740> up<00:02:58.860> making

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
make the Chikorita so he ended up making

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.620 
make the Chikorita so he ended up making
it<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.520> light<00:02:59.880> green<00:03:00.150> sort<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.510> thing

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
it this really light green sort of thing

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
it this really light green sort of thing
which<00:03:00.720> doesn't<00:03:01.140> look<00:03:02.100> exactly<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.970> but

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
which doesn't look exactly like it but

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.580 
which doesn't look exactly like it but
like<00:03:03.240> what<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> Bailey<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.050> he<00:03:04.170> had<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.380> end<00:03:04.500> up

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
like what the Bailey if he had to end up

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.190 
like what the Bailey if he had to end up
making<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> body<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:06.360> same<00:03:06.570> color<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.020> like

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
making the body the same color is like

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.540 
making the body the same color is like
the<00:03:07.320> cyndaquil<00:03:07.710> which<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.040> honestly<00:03:08.340> not<00:03:08.490> that

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the cyndaquil which is honestly not that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.790 
the cyndaquil which is honestly not that
bad<00:03:08.820> because<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.180> still<00:03:09.390> looks<00:03:09.600> great<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.680> can

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
bad because it still looks great you can

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.470 
bad because it still looks great you can
