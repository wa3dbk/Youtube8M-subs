00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello people welcome one more day to the 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.050
 channel I hope you are very well 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.140
 as always I wish you and nothing the video of 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.900
 Today is about a tutorial opinion of 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.370
 This nail kit of the brand fingers that 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.370
 will be around 17 euros 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.340
 good 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 we started without delay with the first 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.120
 step and this would remove our makeup 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.940
 nails in case we have them already 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.610
 painted in case you ask me I'm 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 using this enamel kit the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 brand they made a leader that is not bad 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 but it smells pretty strong well let's 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 gossip to see what that kit brings us 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 pincelito for the acrylic some tips 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.470
 nail a lime an orange stick or 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.170
 a container for the liquid and then 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 call yourself the powders but we follow the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.330
 next way first of all we file 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.129
 our nails look that always the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.040
 in the same way to avoid this 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.350
 that they break or fray then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.050
 we should remove the layer of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.750
 brasilia to call it that 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.910
 of the nail from the surface of the nail 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.910
 now it is true that the lime that we 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.590
 comes in the kit is a little bit aggressive 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.590
 for my taste for this task 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.439
 Now remove the cuticles 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.170
 we can cut perfectly I prefer 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.969
 move backwards and this step what 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.610
 we perform with some care of not 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.710
 hurt us we clean the excess of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.710
 powder with a paper a kleenex 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.170
 let's choose now the measure of the tip 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.330
 according to the size of our nail you have to 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.360
 to be perfectly overlapped ours 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890
 and now the fun part use this 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.260
 glue that is not worth anything and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.620
 get it out of there thing that is mission 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.990
 impossible to let my fingers squeeze the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.900
 little boat and so that it comes out 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.790
 just a little drop apart that you have to 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.300
 be three hours holding the tip 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.700
 on the nail so that it sticks minimally 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.220
 and if you can call that paste clear 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.640
 in the end I had to use a glue 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.550
 mine that he bought in a store 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.060
 Professional for acrylic nails 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.720
 we also managed to paste 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.760
 those tips on our nails 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.820
 we repeat the same process for each one 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.860
 we are choosing the measure of the tip 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.860
 for our nail and we're sticking 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.380
 one 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.630
 We cut according to the desired length and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.630
 then we filed 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:18.430
 once this step is finished we pour the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.430
 liquid inside the container 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.300
 my first impression when opening the powders 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.599
 was that I saw them too dense as 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.569
 granulated too thick and justly 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.599
 for acrylic nails the nails 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.690
 artificial against thinner the the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.750
 dust better application and better too 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.060
 in sight come soak the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.459
 brush at the beginning so that the hair 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.140
 release a little bit of if you can 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.120
 handle and then we remove most of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.260
 liquid we wet the tip of the brush 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.900
 inside the dust and we start not from the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.590
 cuticle but to a millimeter of the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.150
 cuticle and we're combing towards the tip 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.939
 of the nail 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.819
 here the trick is to withdraw all the 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.370
 excess or no longer the excess but a large part 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.039
 of the liquid because let's say that with that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.389
 hair that brush absorbs too much or 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:25.850
 retains too much liquid with which 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.940
 we have it there as watery not then 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.639
 we must try to withdraw most of the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.530
 liquid that is the flow that can 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.060
 happen if we use too much the 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.160
 liquid then what are you seeing now 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.039
 same layers are formed and 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.979
 consequently we lose by in my 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:47.539
 opinion here I find it so much 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.160
 by the brush as by the powders because 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.830
 because the brush has the head 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.470
 square and I prefer the brushes a 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.500
 little finished in tip to be able 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.080
 work better the edges of the nail to 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.020
 do not eat the cuticle so as not to step on 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.139
 because if not then bubbles are formed 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.680
 of air and lifts the nail and dust 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.389
 Sincerely, it is terrible, it generates 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.240
 granulomas that you do not know the reason of that 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.250
 consistency and finally no comments is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.330
 a difficult material to work now 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.090
 well when you finish it's true that you tend 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.940
 to compensate a little bit I do not know how they have 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.419
 achieved that but good tends to stay 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.659
 in plain sight, let's say 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.599
 that aesthetically is passable but 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.789
 someone a professional who is dedicated to 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.460
 that or someone who understands nails what 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.130
 You will see right away if you are already 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.030
 laborious to have to make you or a 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.870
 person making herself both hands 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:56.720
 Well, here it does not facilitate it, because as 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.030
 You see it costs the brush to drop the 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.250
 stuff on the nail but good then 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.139
 it seems that it is solving very 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.550
 important also clean the brush 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:10.880
 every time you finish a layer because well 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.460
 then if there would not be lumps that 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.880
 it would dry on our brush 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.220
 would prevent us from continuing with more 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.919
 layers and even if it dries on the 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.330
 brush and the tooth of this loss 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.490
 also a trick that I like a lot 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.229
 employ each professional every 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.840
 person who puts nails does it to his 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.720
 way but I learned it from this and me 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.050
 I really like that it is always done in 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.539
 the central part of the thicker nail 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.090
 so much that the tip as that cuticle 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:43.880
 the cuticle does have to be a 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.470
 very thin layer very light so when the 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.870
 nail grows not noticed both 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.500
 demarcation and because the central part 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.560
 thicker to provide it by giving it 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.910
 as more weight and so more security is worth 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.560
 I already got too good 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.620
 you have seen what just happened that 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.220
 When filing the nail on one side it has been 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.890
 raised has risen completely 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.050
 likewise when we finish it leaves 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.510
 musical and after letting it dry is 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.030
 When the nail is filed, it is shaped and 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:18.130
 also above it is given shine with 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.130
 a specific file for that purpose 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.840
 here and you see a capita 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.880
 Brightness going to see that at first glance not 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.950
 It's wrong but I think I work with 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.500
 Professional products noticed a lot 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.810
 the difference anyway this kit what 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.110
 I see more as an emergency kit in case 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.090
 you are on the street and you do not have access to 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.910
 to fix a nail or to give you the 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.920
 rules you or are you traveling or can you 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.380
 serve for good for no but not for 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.240
 a fight bet here you see the 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.490
 material that has been lost for the time 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.980
 amount of dust that brings that too 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.470
 can happen with professional products 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.090
 but a Danish deserves nothing more people 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.890
 I hope you liked the video and I 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.820
 can give an idea if you want 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.740
 buy this kit 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.740
 thanks for watching me and see you soon kisses
