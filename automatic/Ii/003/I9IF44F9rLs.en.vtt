00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:16.180
 I'll call you, think something's going to happen. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.600
 bring the break can be a practice 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:26.380
 enough this piece and if there or 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.360
 the dense radio that is switched to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.010
 Our part here goes at the door. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.460
 on the top it holds the window 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.100
 In fact, let's run up to 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.040
 low and this piece of beauty in the surroundings 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.530
 and this does not come next to the piece 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.450
 black on the case was a white ac set 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.390
 we have to take it out here in the pressure 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:01:03.730
 and having a cut- down underneath restores that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:06.790
 it goes up and down here and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.510
 try to put here in the strength he has 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.280
 a dream here a radio to put on 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.150
 this way by cable is placed 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 later in the case here in my case 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.180
 had spoiled not only drag and broke 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.670
 This one had broken also ended up giving 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.220
 broke parts here in March and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 was the only unusable 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.570
 one of the cars also spoiled 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.270
 worn and I had to change too 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.640
 I bought another car so it's basically 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.920
 a kit if the engine does not damage it 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.090
 that this engine 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.549
 It's not bad, you take out. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 in this piece is in this position here in 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.409
 door 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.450
 this in- engine position 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.210
 You have to take this monitor here. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:14.030
 geneci boot connector and hangover this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:18.980
 stone 52 52 below and one that supports 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.720
 the engine that removing these five setbacks 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.269
 and that today can already take this piece 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.840
 from inside the door 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.140
 so that's got you here is to 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.250
 drop our part here and replace the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.750
 cables you have to pull out that motor bag 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.330
 today 15 and video will come out the piece you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.630
 knows these three screws that was a 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:50.540
 lol star took it from three screws 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:53.470
 in this piece round 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.630
 in case you have damaged you change the pulley 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.780
 replace the cables and that the cable already 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.480
 is far and if I asked you to 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.480
 do in the measure did not have these doors 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.239
 here contributed in the size and took the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.359
 mode car cut in size and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.450
 Re-made for me, you can do it. 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.970
 this will also put first cables 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.600
 on the pulley then fit it in here 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.160
 and screwing once an already coiled cable 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.730
 here passed here inside 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.770
 and placed here can not more than 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.700
 own party that already locks the car 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.510
 no problem you stretch that catch 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
 one side 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.000
 do me first that side that if not 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.090
 You will not have put the step here and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.530
 lock in the piece has a fitting and straight 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:54.040
 for her and one underneath then 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.010
 passed it took beauty that side that 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.280
 It has said it intends to get up and 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.060
 pull on street rachid and work 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.430
 conditioning 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.700
 Are you the institute or another around here? 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.950
 puts another side notes that this piece 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.300
 she leaves immobile is just for 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.530
 Press this car if you do not 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.680
 I would have to get here. She has the game. 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.800
 first you will put the plastic 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.680
 then you will run the cable through 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.680
 last you'll only put one olympic 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.220
 It 's really easy on her and you're taking it here. 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.200
 Looking Jose is not much mystery 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:43.180
 placed here is only intended to 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.430
 for the assembly of the part will make a 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.710
 more elaborate thing because I 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:55.930
 I'll also do the test then fly the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.790
 from the installation of the first see if 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.200
 You can open it and see if it 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.910
 solve not giving because I search 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.919
 someone who specializes in the area that 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.000
 obviously much better than me and more 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.570
 quick as well 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.780
 but I 'll follow at least until now 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.970
 It's very quiet, you just did not torque 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.850
 Screw the screws when I'm done. 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.680
 have to put you here is already 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.270
 I will give a modified one with the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.090
 wd 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.090
 and I already bought the disc and repeated it to focus 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.130
 in his own store to breeze where 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.810
 you will buy the drag and rotate 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.860
 in the house to have spoiled 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.920
 he already knows the exact measurement of the limit 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.870
 believed to be 3 16 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.600
 if I do not mistake a dash to dash 6 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.910
 about 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.800
 but just ask at the store he already knows 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.500
 exactly what they are yes I asked for one 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.310
 in case something goes wrong to have a 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.490
 Spare nail 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:12.590
 this part of the assembly of the balcony part 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.170
 that's when I go and I'll do a tutorial too 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.510
 another video installation in the car and 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.620
 Then by the assembly of the door you will already 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.170
 get to know how it's fitting her 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:27.100
 This is a hug and until the next 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.100
 the next video next door
