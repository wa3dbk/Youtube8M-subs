00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 but welcome and good afternoon 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.430
 zaidÃ­n stern and c because it will bring us 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 all the details about the world of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.360
 irina technology that as they have given 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 thank you andreas good afternoon and saw 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.960
 that we are always trying to see how 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.540
 things sound weeks ago we saw 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.970
 how the stratosphere of the earth sounded 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 also how can you sing or talk a 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 whale and now scientists from the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 University of Science and Technology 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.119
 China could determine how they sound 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.840
 the brain waves took for example 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 a 21-year-old woman and a 14- year-old girl 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.329
 and they made them an electroencephalogram to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 from there when we think of the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 brain 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.719
 sends neurons impulses 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 electrical and this will look in a box 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.129
 a form of image what they did was 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.440
 transpose the images to notes 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.199
 and from there with the button 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 or the timbre and duration of these waves 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.079
 brain building a song on base 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.320
 to what women thought 21 years and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.120
 the girl of 14 and we're going to hear how 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.640
 the thoughts sound and then they 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.590
 I tell what the show is for 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.590
 as you see 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.100
 scientists say that beyond the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
 scientific curiosity of what we are 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.600
 listening is a very good this kind of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 studies can serve to help the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.330
 people with stress and anxiety so that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.100
 can recover their tranquility 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.300
 results were published in 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.340
 important scientific journals and 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.210
 we are listening to two types of waves 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 brain 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.119
 that differ by tone and intensity 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 and while there is still a lack of evidence to 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.400
 know exactly what waves can 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 represented in a melody 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.330
 these advances can unravel part 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.100
 of the hidden truth of our brain and 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.780
 maybe with a person is nervous and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.110
 is thinking 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.410
 some thought is worth the redundancy 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.670
 What worries him, this responds to a 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 active melody and with music applying 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.050
 music therapy can be reached 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.600
 give the brain a response 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.670
 similar this is one of the many 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.430
 explanations of why scientists 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.880
 they wanted to transform thought into 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880
 music 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.739
 exciting death page
