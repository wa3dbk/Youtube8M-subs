to do one side you have number two
injector<00:00:16.650> balance<00:00:16.920> rate<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.699> extremely<00:00:17.850> high

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
injector balance rate was extremely high

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
injector balance rate was extremely high
so<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.410> didn't<00:00:19.560> want<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> full<00:00:20.039> set<00:00:20.340> so

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
so you didn't want to do a full set so

back<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> place<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:13.560> I'll<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.070> bit

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
back in place is I'll take a little bit

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
back in place is I'll take a little bit
of<00:01:14.340> silicone<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> top<00:01:16.380> of

these once these are tight what that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.170 
these once these are tight what that
does<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.320> keep<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> debris<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.700> the
