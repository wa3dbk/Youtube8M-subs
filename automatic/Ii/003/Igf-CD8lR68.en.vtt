00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.900
 we are in morelos stadium 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.850
 we come to ask those who receive the 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.469
 mote of the monarchs of the team of 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.120
 manylia tell us that it is because of the 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.610
 butterfly but really the answer 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 has to do more with history clarified 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.630
 for the butterfly of red and yellow the 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.820
 true the monarch of heart but 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.520
 heart that each season change 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.750
 T-shirt and everything they need 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.519
 explain the reason and why is it the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.380
 color that distinguishes us because each 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.420
 free and sovereign state is governed by its 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 own laws tells the monarchs by 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 the butterflies 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.489
 butterfly 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:44.859
 that leads as are the monarchs and there is a 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.079
 next to the monarch butterflies I 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:52.229
 I imagine that the expected butterfly 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.229
 monarch 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.079
 if we hit the owners before they were 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.570
 great spain and for creating a monarch 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:07.570
 will be a king who lived bought this from 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 Spain team bought the team from 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 morelia some great Spain bought 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.020
 monarchs are pro kings kings of each 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.020
 state 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.230
 because they are from here of the city of 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.740
 morelia no 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.640
 the notes of conjugating molar that his 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.870
 monarch verb conjugates the verb 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.180
 monarch butterfly 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.350
 for the monarch butterflies here and for 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 have obtained sperm titles 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.899
 the championship that diffuses the nickname of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.899
 monarchs 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.170
 I already sensed that I was going to be monarch myself 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.750
 I think we're going to ask, I think 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.069
 what he always says in the monarchy 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 romantic style in the world 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.629
 according to a tradition brought from 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 they wanted it to be read athletic or 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.730
 morella but say monarchs because 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.680
 apparently he was champion 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 the butterfly by the butterfly of shots and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.709
 taquan is like in the time of inpe el 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.389
 imperialism that the monarch is the king 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.480
 then the monarchs are the kings 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:42.330
 who emigrate 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.210
 and canada it seems to me it 's the other way around it does not come 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.540
 from canada to here 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.860
 for the kings of Spain who arrived 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 from there that were the monarchs 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.690
 then from there and they came to here 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.990
 if those say one and the others that say 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.900
 they are for the butterflies they remind 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.390
 the players or not but with the team 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:09.410
 monarchs are butterflies are monarchs 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:19.330
 we are all monarchs not the team of 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:19.330
 monarchs the butterfly but the study
