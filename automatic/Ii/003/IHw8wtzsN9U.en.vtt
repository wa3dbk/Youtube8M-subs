these<00:00:17.660> are<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:17.960> two<00:00:18.110> that<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:18.290> have<00:00:18.470> right<00:00:18.650> now

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
these are the two that I have right now

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.179 
these are the two that I have right now
my<00:00:20.150> favorite<00:00:20.540> is<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.930> berry<00:00:21.170> one<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:21.770> know<00:00:21.980> I

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
my favorite is the berry one you know I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.890 
my favorite is the berry one you know I
don't<00:00:22.760> have<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.150> one<00:00:23.330> in<00:00:23.450> here<00:00:23.720> right<00:00:23.869> now

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
don't have that one in here right now

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.359 
don't have that one in here right now
because<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.590> used<00:00:24.950> them<00:00:25.099> all<00:00:25.160> up

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
because I I used them all up

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.540 
because I I used them all up
so<00:00:26.240> this<00:00:26.689> is<00:00:26.840> what<00:00:27.020> they<00:00:27.140> look<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.349> it's<00:00:28.340> like

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
so this is what they look like it's like

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.140 
so this is what they look like it's like
a<00:00:28.580> giant<00:00:29.060> horse<00:00:29.270> pill<00:00:29.600> basically<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.590> it's<00:00:31.250> I

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
a giant horse pill basically and it's I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.180 
a giant horse pill basically and it's I
think<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:32.629> scored<00:00:33.080> no<00:00:33.680> I<00:00:33.710> guess<00:00:33.980> it's<00:00:34.129> not

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
think it's scored no I guess it's not

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.400 
think it's scored no I guess it's not
scored<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:34.940> thought<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:35.750> might<00:00:35.870> be<00:00:35.900> scored<00:00:36.320> in

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
scored I thought it might be scored in

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.680 
scored I thought it might be scored in
the<00:00:36.470> middle<00:00:36.710> but<00:00:36.830> it's<00:00:36.949> not<00:00:37.300> so<00:00:38.300> basically

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
the middle but it's not so basically

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.960 
the middle but it's not so basically
what<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.080> do<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:39.800> take<00:00:40.100> one<00:00:40.879> of

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
what you do is you just take one of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.229 
what you do is you just take one of
these<00:00:41.059> out<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.250> about<00:00:43.250> one<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.699> a<00:00:43.820> quarter<00:00:44.059> of

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
these out and about one and a quarter of

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.570 
these out and about one and a quarter of
these<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:45.140> how<00:00:45.739> much<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.040> want<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.250> use<00:00:46.280> for

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
these is is how much you want to use for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.910 
these is is how much you want to use for
each<00:00:46.729> liter<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:48.110> if<00:00:48.229> you<00:00:48.350> have<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.500> three<00:00:48.710> liter

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
each liter so if you have a three liter

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.549 
each liter so if you have a three liter
Camelback<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.670> want<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.909> pro<00:00:50.229> throw<00:00:51.229> three

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
Camelback you want to pro throw three

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.840 
Camelback you want to pro throw three
and<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> half<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:52.010> there<00:00:52.190> or<00:00:52.430> three<00:00:52.670> and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
and a half in there or three and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.750 
and a half in there or three and
whatever<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.010> kind<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.370> scored<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:55.699> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
whatever it is kind of scored in the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.539 
whatever it is kind of scored in the
middle<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.059> guess<00:00:56.299> just<00:00:56.510> barely<00:00:57.339> so<00:00:58.339> you<00:00:58.430> can

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
middle I guess just barely so you can

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.820 
middle I guess just barely so you can
kind<00:00:58.699> of<00:00:58.760> break<00:00:58.909> them<00:00:59.030> in<00:00:59.150> half<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.530> there's

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
kind of break them in half so there's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.869 
kind of break them in half so there's
here's<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:02.120> orange<00:01:02.479> one<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:04.760> has

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
here's the the orange one that has

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.560 
here's the the orange one that has
caffeine<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:06.470> here's<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.549> lemon-lime<00:01:08.270> one

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
caffeine and here's the lemon-lime one

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.960 
caffeine and here's the lemon-lime one
that<00:01:08.840> doesn't<00:01:09.049> have<00:01:09.170> caffeine<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.970> that's

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
that doesn't have caffeine and that's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.060 
that doesn't have caffeine and that's
what<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:12.320> can<00:01:12.740> tell<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:12.950> right

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
and your Camelback it can really be

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.260 
and your Camelback it can really be
incredibly<00:01:32.929> make<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.729> drinking<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.759> water<00:01:35.090> a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
incredibly make the drinking the water a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.080 
incredibly make the drinking the water a
lot<00:01:35.509> easier<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.979> has<00:01:37.219> electrolytes<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:37.969> it

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
lot easier and it has electrolytes in it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.459 
lot easier and it has electrolytes in it
and<00:01:38.210> some<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.659> like<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:38.990> have<00:01:39.229> caffeine
