00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.670
 well here we are presenting 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.700
 our project 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 from here we have the first part that is a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.910
 system ene efe as you will see are tube 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.710
 110 in 4 meters with one more hole or 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.349
 less than 120 millimeters in diameter 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.610
 where in the interior in some we have 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.380
 plants that are growing little by little not 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.210
 we have for example there in the dow 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.210
 Here we have lettuces 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.570
 Here we have more lettuces are small 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.990
 still because we recently put them 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.660
 here we have other photos 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.630
 we have the first part of filtering with 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.770
 home filter we did where we put 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.770
 cleaning elements 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.700
 the only thing that does this is to help 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 gather the garbage so that it does not enter 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.219
 the pump a centrifugal pump 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.219
 2,400 liters per hour 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 to help with the tanks because 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 now we have the 1000 liter tanks 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.759
 of water each one good the first 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 problem that we have to define with the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.790
 algae that are forming us 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 We know if due to the lack of fish 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.070
 the water temperature had been the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.409
 topic 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 and here also good here is more distinguished 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 because we passed the hand then it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 reaches to distinguish the theme of water 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.580
 well we are having the problem that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580
 I do not know if it distinguishes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.050
 this tank has a lot more water than 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 this other then we can not do that 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.840
 maintain the levels 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have the quill of spaces 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.219
 is so to do open way however 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 keeps on the bass and this machine a 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.750
 level beyond 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.180
 here we have 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.210
 two tachos two are three boxes but 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.550
 where we use a siphon filtering 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.440
 as you will see we have stones here 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.970
 that the only thing we do here is open the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.470
 tap for these water sessions 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.679
 comes with the nutrients that are the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.629
 fish waste 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.180
 that makes them stay in the plant and 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.670
 help in the degradation so that the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 plants can not absorb here we put 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.080
 some simoniello rosemary and simÃ³n 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 basil that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.620
 it seems to be holding well here I have a 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.130
 little squash that 1 day ago what 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.370
 we put is at least has strength 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:39.730
 well enter the water is full reaches 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.730
 level and begins to empty when empty 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.879
 low oxygenated and clean 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.879
 the bottom 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.000
 I do not know if you can see 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.739
 This is where my finger is 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 from that drop to suck the pump does the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.220
 travel 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.739
 and you upload it and well enter again the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 ntf circuit and goes to the taps that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.430
 fill the tanks we wanted to know if 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.180
 someone you could give advice to the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.599
 subject of the levels we can not maintain 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.599
 certain level 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.240
 and the issue of the formation of if someone 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.840
 We can help you be much appreciated 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.840
 until next time
