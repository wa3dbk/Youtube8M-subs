00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello friends friends here we are again 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.240
 when it is always what I say to the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.490
 entry so you know me from the beginning 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.699
 well today I'm going to talk about these people 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.920
 that we never know that exists 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.230
 but they do know that we 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.900
 we exist because because we are with 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.880
 ears on and be aware what 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.449
 what we are already doing or what is not 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.000
 we are doing if it is well so while 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.239
 I do not enlarge that I do not walk 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.949
 come from behind putting fire in there 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.809
 all the time in you have to be peaceful 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.839
 when for example yesterday talking to 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.170
 some girls and I say look how it says 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.409
 when one for example I'm happy 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.719
 and nobody puts anything student for some 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.260
 they say for me that I like it and everything but 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.449
 when one for him I'm pissed off I screw up 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.869
 in everything that is tidal and all the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 messages that has happened that is what 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.320
 they want to set fire that's 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 you have to be very careful with this 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.259
 that's why here is peaceful there's no 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.259
 they say nothing there is no one who sets fire 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.720
 and if you have to pacify things well 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.659
 but you do not have to be there giving 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 giving me good I hope that with those 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 tips 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.030
 we will have a much better life today 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 of the hip is I have to lift is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.979
 normally the other race deviates has 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.520
 foot of contracted buttocks factories 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.360
