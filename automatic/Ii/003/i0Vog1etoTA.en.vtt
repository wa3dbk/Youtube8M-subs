00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 they are professionals in 85 and the first 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.359
 contact with the great ones had it 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.359
 precisely there in hilton head 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160
 display 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 90 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.250
 and further back 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:39.990
 here is a tournament that I remember very 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.980
 alright is l hilton head that was 85 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.980
 It was 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.239
 a moment a very nice week for me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 the surprises 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.530
 one of the points of great inflection in 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 gabriela's career because there 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.260
 begins to realize that she 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.040
 really going to be among the big 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.500
 I won a3 to ba2 now from which 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.150
 they were among the ten that were fans to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.150
 see in the hand was worth going 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.780
 I remember that I was with one of 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.659
 trust in my game I felt 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.840
 I felt very good 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 and I felt I could do anything 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.149
 at that point that I also think that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.700
 took to another level and good to start seeing 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.700
 to the big ones and not like chris evert 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.360
 a nice match I was already made 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.650
 let's say with being in the final but the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 fact of being playing against what I did 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.580
 it was something very special 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.560
 there the entire American press is 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.420
 he realized that already gabriela sabatini 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.290
 it stopped being a project for 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.290
 become a reality
