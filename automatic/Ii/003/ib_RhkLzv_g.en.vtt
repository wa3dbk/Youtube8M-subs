it<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:39.959> 50k<00:02:40.440> well<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.670> basically

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
it for 50k well that is basically

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.510 
it for 50k well that is basically
because<00:02:42.690> i'm<00:02:43.680> not<00:02:43.860> trying<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> put<00:02:44.190> ollie<00:02:44.310> down

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.550 
because i'm not trying to put ollie down
or<00:02:44.700> anything<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.510> i<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.959> personally<00:02:46.140> talking

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
or anything but i was personally talking

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.460 
or anything but i was personally talking
about<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:46.950> GFX<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.020> today<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.320> not

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
about to do GFX and today it's just not

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
as experienced that doing it so I guess

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
as experienced that doing it so I guess
the<00:02:51.570> quality<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:51.989> my<00:02:52.110> backgrounds<00:02:52.650> might<00:02:53.250> be

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the quality of my backgrounds might be

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.170 
the quality of my backgrounds might be
quite<00:02:53.670> might<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.080> better<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.880> don't

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
quite might be a bit better but I don't

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.030 
quite might be a bit better but I don't
know<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.300> can<00:02:57.690> judge<00:02:57.870> stuff<00:02:58.050> yourselves<00:02:58.500> but

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
