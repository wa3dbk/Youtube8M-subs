in half from this way and so you know

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.090 
in half from this way and so you know
this<00:05:11.540> way<00:05:11.780> because<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.860> too<00:05:13.160> bad<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:15.650> then

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
this way because it's too bad and then

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.710 
this way because it's too bad and then
after<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.060> do<00:05:17.210> that<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.780> just<00:05:18.440> want<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:19.720> put
