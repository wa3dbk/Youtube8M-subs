00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:09.985
Today is a happy day for us here in Ogre.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:13.375
We have received 28 boxes

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:18.181
of batteries from Winston Battery in People's Republic of China.

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:23.452
It has been six month since we first approached the Winston Battery company

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:25.945
and introduced them to our OSCar eO project.

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:30.491
And after two and a half month in the sea

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.206
these yellow batteries have arrived today in Ogre, Latvia

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:38.752
Batteries are one of the most important components of electric cars

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:44.815
and we chose Winston Battery because they are one 
 of the best producers of such batteries.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:51.664
Today we have received 660 such battery packs

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:55.505
Inside OSCar there will be 172 of them

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:59.082
The potential difference of each battery is 3.2 volts.

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:02.647
The charge of each battery pack is 100 ampere-hours.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:07.733
Combining them in OSCar in series, we'll get the 
 total potential difference of around 600 volts.

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:09.149
Which is a really high voltage.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.239
What do those 100 ampere-hours actually mean?

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.883
For example, I have here a simple photo camera

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:20.453
and inside it is a tiny battery

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:23.160
and comparing them side by side we notice that

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.137
This one is much smaller but its charge is 
 132 times lower compared to that one

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.740
So, if we combined 132 of these small batteries, 
 we would obtain one 100 ampere-hour battery.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.810
The batteries inside OSCar will have the total energy of 61 kilowatt hour.

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:48.690
Which is a lot of energy.

00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:54.960
A regular electric car on a regular highway could 
 go more than 300 kilometers with that.

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:58.100
During the Dakar rally, when the road conditions are much tougher

00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:01.390
we will be able to drive approximately 150 kilometers.

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:05.800
Not all of these battery packs will be placed inside OSCar eO.

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:13.180
In the coming month we'll build an electric Nissan Navara test car

00:02:13.182 --> 00:02:16.580
in which we'll place the same amount of batteries as in OSCar

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.810
And the rest of batteries we'll be in 
 the support truck during the Dakar rally

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:26.120
in case we need to service the car.
