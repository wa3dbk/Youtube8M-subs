powder<00:00:38.230> into<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.129> we'll<00:00:39.280> get<00:00:39.489> the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
powder into it so we'll get the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
chocolate cake batter as well before we

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.290 
chocolate cake batter as well before we
start<00:00:42.280> making<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.610> cake<00:00:42.850> batter

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
start making the cake batter

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:57.030 
start making the cake batter
let's<00:00:44.280> 50<00:00:45.280> degrees<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.620> put<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
let's 50 degrees here I have put all the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.160 
let's 50 degrees here I have put all the
dry<00:00:57.340> ingredients<00:00:57.969> together<00:00:58.120> into<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> flour

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
dry ingredients together into a flour

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.310 
dry ingredients together into a flour
sifter<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.399> this<00:01:00.790> one<00:01:01.000> has<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.480> flour<00:01:01.750> baking

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
sifter so this one has the flour baking

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.889 
sifter so this one has the flour baking
powder<00:01:02.350> baking<00:01:02.860> soda<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.460> salt<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.629> I'm<00:01:04.720> gonna

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
powder baking soda and salt so I'm gonna

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.660 
powder baking soda and salt so I'm gonna
sift<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.440> into<00:01:05.590> another<00:01:05.830> Bowl

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
sift it into another Bowl

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.270 
sift it into another Bowl
so<00:01:06.970> by<00:01:07.090> sifting<00:01:07.470> everything<00:01:08.470> will<00:01:08.619> be<00:01:08.770> evenly

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
so by sifting everything will be evenly

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
so by sifting everything will be evenly
mixed<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.630> will<00:01:10.869> really<00:01:11.320> love<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> sceptic

well it will be slightly grainy so don't

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.130 
well it will be slightly grainy so don't
worry<00:02:00.799> about<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.700> we're<00:02:01.850> gonna<00:02:02.060> add<00:02:02.299> one

these two batters alternatively into a
cake<00:03:54.849> pan<00:03:54.880> which<00:03:55.840> will<00:03:56.080> eventually<00:03:56.590> give<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
cake pan which will eventually give a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.330 
cake pan which will eventually give a
marbled<00:03:57.550> effect<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.810> let's<00:03:58.840> go<00:03:59.739> ahead<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.190> do

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
marbled effect so let's go ahead and do

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.190 
marbled effect so let's go ahead and do
it<00:04:00.489> I'm<00:04:00.790> going<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.360> make<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.690> cake<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.110> a

it I'm going to make the cake in a
springform<00:04:02.739> pan<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:03.489> in<00:04:03.610> this<00:04:03.790> pan<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.300> can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
springform pan so in this pan you can

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.320 
springform pan so in this pan you can
separate<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.410> base<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:07.330> top<00:04:07.630> part<00:04:09.330> or

batter so it's okay

batter so it's okay
you<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:14.960> have<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.380> spread<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.800> on<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.580> middle

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
you just have to spread it on the middle

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.650 
you just have to spread it on the middle
so<00:05:17.690> next<00:05:17.840> we<00:05:18.080> are<00:05:18.110> gonna<00:05:18.260> add<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.770> rest<00:05:19.450> of<00:05:20.450> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
pan so next we can make some pattern on

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.360 
pan so next we can make some pattern on
the<00:05:49.930> top<00:05:50.139> using<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.800> fork<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.400> can<00:05:52.000> gently<00:05:53.370> make

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
the top using a fork you can gently make

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.490 
the top using a fork you can gently make
some<00:05:54.580> pattern<00:05:57.539> this<00:05:58.539> looks<00:05:58.870> perfect

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
some pattern this looks perfect

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.560 
some pattern this looks perfect
