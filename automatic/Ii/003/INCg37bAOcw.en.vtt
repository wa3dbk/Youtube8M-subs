00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
contain easily switch right into so

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.150 
contain easily switch right into so
basically<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:31.050> have<00:04:31.169> two<00:04:31.260> core<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:31.800> that's<00:04:32.039> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
basically we have two core so that's the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.180 
basically we have two core so that's the
