focus on this one today is August is not

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630 
focus on this one today is August is not
the<00:01:17.490> only<00:01:17.670> inflammatory<00:01:18.420> mediator<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.950> it's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the only inflammatory mediator but it's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460 
the only inflammatory mediator but it's
one<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.000> been<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.810> studied

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
one that's been really well studied

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.190 
one that's been really well studied
for<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.159> than<00:01:23.310> two<00:01:23.490> decades<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.240> there's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
for more than two decades and there's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.649 
for more than two decades and there's
drugs<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> market<00:01:26.490> such<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.119> Remicade

and<00:01:27.930> envelope<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:29.299> specifically<00:01:30.299> block

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and envelope which specifically block

TNF<00:01:31.530> alpha<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.040> people<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
TNF alpha in people so because this is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
TNF alpha in people so because this is
on<00:01:34.259> America<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.549> take<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> discussion<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
on America what can take a discussion to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
on America what can take a discussion to
the<00:01:36.630> level<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.409> animals<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.040> also

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the level not just of animals but also

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.050 
the level not just of animals but also
our<00:01:38.640> people<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.280> TNF<00:01:41.280> alpha<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.329> found<00:01:42.720> in

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
our people so TNF alpha it's found in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.399 
our people so TNF alpha it's found in
conditions<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> inflammation<00:01:45.450> such<00:01:46.110> as

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
conditions of inflammation such as

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.090 
conditions of inflammation such as
smoking<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.729> found<00:01:48.090> elevated<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:49.110> obesity

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
smoking it's found elevated in obesity

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.539 
smoking it's found elevated in obesity

genetically<00:05:52.610> engineered<00:05:53.120> not<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.660> have<00:05:53.840> this

inflammatory mediators TNF alpha have
more<00:05:58.390> spontaneous<00:05:59.390> erections<00:05:59.830> so<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:01.430> point

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
more spontaneous erections so the point

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.770 
more spontaneous erections so the point
of<00:06:01.760> all<00:06:01.910> talking<00:06:02.300> about<00:06:02.710> is<00:06:03.710> that

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
of all talking about is that

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.330 
of all talking about is that
inflammation<00:06:06.910> seems<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.240> be<00:06:08.420> one<00:06:09.290> of<00:06:09.320> the<00:06:09.740> key

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
inflammation seems to be one of the key

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.200 
inflammation seems to be one of the key
causative<00:06:10.940> events<00:06:11.600> in<00:06:11.780> decreasing<00:06:13.210> the

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
causative events in decreasing the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.630 
causative events in decreasing the
amount<00:06:14.330> of<00:06:14.750> repair<00:06:15.260> cells<00:06:15.680> in<00:06:16.010> circulation

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
amount of repair cells in circulation

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.210 
amount of repair cells in circulation
and<00:06:17.480> when<00:06:17.840> you<00:06:17.930> have<00:06:18.140> less<00:06:18.350> of<00:06:18.380> these<00:06:18.710> repair

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
and when you have less of these repair

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.360 
and when you have less of these repair
cells<00:06:19.550> then<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:20.540> body<00:06:20.960> does<00:06:21.230> not<00:06:21.380> heal<00:06:21.860> itself

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
cells then the body does not heal itself

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.030 
cells then the body does not heal itself
this<00:06:23.120> aleast<00:06:23.510> is<00:06:23.720> our<00:06:23.930> thinking<00:06:24.440> right<00:06:24.770> now

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040
