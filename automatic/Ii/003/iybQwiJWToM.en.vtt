00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
to be more precise a how color video I'm

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.830 
to be more precise a how color video I'm
going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:09.059> showing<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.510> different

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
going to be showing you different

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.100 
going to be showing you different
coloring<00:00:10.650> techniques<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> use<00:00:11.929> but<00:00:12.929> in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
coloring techniques that I use but in

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.240 
coloring techniques that I use but in
order<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.799> need<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> have

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
order to do that I need to have

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.680 
order to do that I need to have
something<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> color<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> begin

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
something to color so I'm going to begin

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.470 
something to color so I'm going to begin
all<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.170> time-lapse<00:00:16.440> doing<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> drawing<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
all in time-lapse doing a drawing of a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.750 
all in time-lapse doing a drawing of a
realistic<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:19.949> those<00:00:20.130> lines<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.699> in

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
realistic I get all those lines down in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.279 
realistic I get all those lines down in
place<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.359> then<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> move<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
place and then we can move on to the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:34.520 
place and then we can move on to the
coloring<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.949> let's<00:00:23.250> get<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:33.469> alright<00:00:34.469> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
coloring so let's get to it alright so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
coloring so let's get to it alright so
we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> basic<00:00:35.040> lines<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.640> place<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
we've got the basic lines in place now a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.280 
we've got the basic lines in place now a
lot<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> might<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.630> saying<00:00:36.870> hey<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.170> was

lot of you might be saying hey that was
all<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.559> time-lapse<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.219> impossible<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
all in time-lapse it's impossible to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
all in time-lapse it's impossible to
keep<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> well<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> good<00:00:40.469> news<00:00:40.530> is

into<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> color<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.640> materials<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.210> using

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
into the color the materials I'm using

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
into the color the materials I'm using
are<00:00:51.660> watercolors<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.410> come<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:52.860> tubes

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
are watercolors that come from tubes

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
are watercolors that come from tubes

good art supply store is gonna have

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.479 
good art supply store is gonna have
these<00:00:57.989> kinds<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> watercolors<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.370> an

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
these kinds of watercolors and just an

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
these kinds of watercolors and just an
ordinary<00:00:59.670> brush<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> I'm<00:01:00.809> gonna<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.260> by

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ordinary brush and I'm gonna start by

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.549 
ordinary brush and I'm gonna start by
putting<00:01:01.410> down<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.039> light<00:01:02.430> wash<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.210> color

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
putting down a very light wash of color

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
putting down a very light wash of color
that<00:01:04.559> means<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> water<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.820> little

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that means a lot of water very little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
that means a lot of water very little
paint<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.840> something<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
paint just to get something down the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
paint just to get something down the
paper<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.189> using<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.180> Strathmore<00:01:09.780> Bristol

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
paper I'm using is a Strathmore Bristol

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
paper I'm using is a Strathmore Bristol
smooth<00:01:11.369> surface<00:01:12.060> nice<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> thick<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
smooth surface nice and thick so it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
smooth surface nice and thick so it
doesn't<00:01:13.320> wrinkle<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> start<00:01:14.549> with

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
doesn't wrinkle up when you start with

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.640 
doesn't wrinkle up when you start with
water<00:01:14.820> coloring<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.479> let's<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:15.990> ahead<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.170> get

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
water coloring so let's go ahead and get

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.780 
water coloring so let's go ahead and get
into<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:24.920> okay<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.369> I've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
into it okay so you can see I've got a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
into it okay so you can see I've got a
very<00:01:27.030> light<00:01:27.299> layer<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.530> really

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
very light layer here I'm not really

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
very light layer here I'm not really
focused<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.189> perfection<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> get

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
focused on perfection I just want to get

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
focused on perfection I just want to get
something<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.950> build<00:01:32.189> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
something down and then I can build on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
something down and then I can build on
top<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.360> move<00:01:33.509> toward<00:01:33.810> final<00:01:34.079> art

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
top of that as we move toward final art

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
top of that as we move toward final art
I'm<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> second<00:01:35.820> layer<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.840> we

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I'm gonna do a second layer now where we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.490 
I'm gonna do a second layer now where we
focus<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.159> details

what I want to do right now is switch to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.530 
what I want to do right now is switch to
colored<00:01:51.250> pencils<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.030> should<00:01:52.210> stress<00:01:52.479> that

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.359 
colored pencils and I should stress that
this<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:52.869> just<00:01:53.110> my<00:01:53.409> technique<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.040> don't<00:01:54.220> mean

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
this is just my technique I don't mean

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.310 
this is just my technique I don't mean
that<00:01:54.400> everybody<00:01:54.909> does<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.420> everyone<00:01:56.080> really

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
that everybody does this everyone really

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.719 
that everybody does this everyone really
finds<00:01:56.619> their<00:01:56.770> own<00:01:56.860> way<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.070> doing<00:01:57.190> things<00:01:57.610> but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
finds their own way of doing things but

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.580 
finds their own way of doing things but
I<00:01:57.790> like<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.119> switch<00:01:58.390> at<00:01:58.690> some<00:01:59.110> point<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
I like to switch at some point to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.320 
I like to switch at some point to
colored<00:01:59.890> pencils<00:02:00.280> tighten<00:02:00.850> things<00:02:00.970> up<00:02:01.180> a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
colored pencils tighten things up a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.639 
colored pencils tighten things up a
little<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.720> then<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.170> kind<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.409> come<00:02:02.619> back

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
little and then we can kind of come back

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.710 
little and then we can kind of come back
to<00:02:03.070> watercolors<00:02:03.880> after<00:02:04.180> I'm<00:02:04.270> done<00:02:04.420> with<00:02:04.600> that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to watercolors after I'm done with that

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.139 
to watercolors after I'm done with that
so<00:02:04.960> let's<00:02:05.140> go<00:02:05.560> ahead<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.770> tighten<00:02:06.549> this<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.759> as

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
so let's go ahead and tighten this up as

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.980 
so let's go ahead and tighten this up as
I<00:02:07.270> said<00:02:07.509> with<00:02:08.080> colored<00:02:08.470> pencils

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.150 

all<00:02:13.990> right<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.260> I'd<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.770> see<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:14.980> many

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
all right so I'd like you to see as many

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.860 
all right so I'd like you to see as many
different<00:02:15.340> coloring<00:02:15.820> tools<00:02:16.000> as<00:02:16.270> possible<00:02:16.780> in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
different coloring tools as possible in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240 
different coloring tools as possible in
this<00:02:16.960> video<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.380> I've<00:02:17.470> decided<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.860> bring<00:02:18.100> out

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
this video so I've decided to bring out

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.970 
this video so I've decided to bring out
these<00:02:18.400> color<00:02:18.730> pastels<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.200> these<00:02:20.650> are<00:02:20.800> great

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
these color pastels and these are great

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.270 
these color pastels and these are great
for<00:02:21.040> creating<00:02:21.610> kind<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.940> smeary<00:02:22.600> foggy<00:02:23.280> misty

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
for creating kind of smeary foggy misty

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.610 
for creating kind of smeary foggy misty
effects<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> look<00:02:26.050> at<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.290> as<00:02:26.500> we

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
effects so I have a look at this as we

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:38.280 
effects so I have a look at this as we
add<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> layer<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.520> colored<00:02:27.850> pastel<00:02:37.230> okay<00:02:38.230> so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
add a layer of colored pastel okay so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.260 
add a layer of colored pastel okay so
you<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.800> how<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> pastels<00:02:39.760> allowed<00:02:40.090> us

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
you can see how the pastels allowed us

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.450 
you can see how the pastels allowed us
to<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> lot<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.780> these<00:02:40.900> foggy<00:02:41.350> smeary<00:02:42.100> kind

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
to get a lot of these foggy smeary kind

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.790 
to get a lot of these foggy smeary kind
of<00:02:42.580> effects<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.270> now<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.170> time<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.440> move<00:02:44.650> on

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
of effects and now it's time to move on

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.140 
of effects and now it's time to move on
to<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> very<00:02:45.130> most<00:02:45.310> important<00:02:45.820> part<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to the very most important part of the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.340 
to the very most important part of the
whole<00:02:46.240> process<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
whole process and that is the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.910 
whole process and that is the
fine-tuning<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:49.330> polishing<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.590> more

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
fine-tuning of the polishing the more

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.470 
fine-tuning of the polishing the more
time<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.310> put<00:02:51.340> into<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.910> better<00:02:52.240> you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
time you put into this the better you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630 
time you put into this the better you
put<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.750> hour<00:02:52.990> into<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.710> it's<00:02:54.040> gonna<00:02:54.160> look<00:02:54.430> good

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
put an hour into it it's gonna look good

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.100 
put an hour into it it's gonna look good
you<00:02:54.790> put<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.180> hours<00:02:55.510> into<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.780> it's<00:02:55.960> going<00:02:56.050> to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you put two hours into it it's going to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.000 
you put two hours into it it's going to
look<00:02:56.230> great

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
look great

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.340 
look great
so<00:02:57.400> let's<00:02:57.880> just<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.750> I'm<00:02:58.960> gonna<00:02:59.140> be

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
so let's just go to it I'm gonna be

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.440 
so let's just go to it I'm gonna be
zipping<00:03:00.190> through<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> you'll<00:03:01.390> see

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
zipping through all of this you'll see

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.360 
zipping through all of this you'll see
watercolors<00:03:02.260> you'll<00:03:02.440> see<00:03:02.650> colored<00:03:02.920> pencils

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
watercolors you'll see colored pencils

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.070 
watercolors you'll see colored pencils
maybe<00:03:03.640> bring<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.000> pastels<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.930> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
maybe bring the pastels back in and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.420 
maybe bring the pastels back in and
trading<00:03:05.350> back<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.680> forth<00:03:05.890> between<00:03:06.070> all<00:03:06.310> these

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
trading back and forth between all these

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.760 
trading back and forth between all these
things<00:03:06.730> until<00:03:07.360> we<00:03:07.450> finally<00:03:07.810> reach<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
things until we finally reach the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.640 
things until we finally reach the
finished<00:03:09.100> product

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:41.309 

[Music]

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.349 

all<00:03:41.920> right<00:03:42.099> well<00:03:42.280> as<00:03:42.489> usual<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.969> went<00:03:43.239> through

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
all right well as usual I went through

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.489 
all right well as usual I went through
an<00:03:43.450> awful<00:03:43.540> lot<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.840> stuff<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.230> time-lapse

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:44.499 
an awful lot of stuff in time-lapse

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.879 
an awful lot of stuff in time-lapse
there<00:03:45.010> but<00:03:45.159> let's<00:03:45.310> consider<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.909> a<00:03:46.120> sort<00:03:46.540> of

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
there but let's consider this a sort of

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.170 
there but let's consider this a sort of
overview<00:03:47.889> video<00:03:48.249> that<00:03:48.489> shows<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.879> all<00:03:49.060> my

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
overview video that shows you all my

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.449 
overview video that shows you all my
various<00:03:49.659> materials<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.829> use<00:03:51.159> in

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
various materials that I use in

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.789 
various materials that I use in
colouring<00:03:51.969> something<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.840> did<00:03:53.379> want<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.590> say

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
colouring something I did want to say

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.459 
colouring something I did want to say
that<00:03:54.129> this<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.700> white<00:03:54.969> gouache<00:03:55.420> here<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.349> a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:56.469 
that this is white gouache here it's a

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.559 
that this is white gouache here it's a
kind<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.709> water-based<00:03:57.280> opaque<00:03:57.939> paint<00:03:58.299> and

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
kind of water-based opaque paint and

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.929 
kind of water-based opaque paint and
that's<00:03:58.689> what<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> use<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.349> add<00:03:59.530> highlights

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
that's what I use to add highlights

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.069 
that's what I use to add highlights
usually<00:04:00.939> wait<00:04:01.120> until<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.389> very<00:04:01.569> end<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
usually wait until the very end of the

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.619 
usually wait until the very end of the
process<00:04:02.349> before<00:04:02.829> adding<00:04:03.400> these<00:04:03.549> gives<00:04:04.450> that

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
process before adding these gives that

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.809 
process before adding these gives that
effect<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:05.109> sort<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.349> glistening<00:04:05.920> light<00:04:06.519> and

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
effect of sort of glistening light and

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.500
