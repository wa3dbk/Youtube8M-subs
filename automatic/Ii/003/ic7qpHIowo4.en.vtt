00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hello everyone, I take offstage myself 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 I want to make pies today 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.540
 ham and cheese or Slavic ham 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 cheese how to not know the name 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.900
 no difference in general so me dough 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 puff yeast bought a kilogram here 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.410
 I have it defrosted already 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 I will roll gently 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.700
 300 grams somewhere well 297 was a piece 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 the store bought the usual any cheese 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 300 grams means cheese crown to tru 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.680
 I'll show you a big one right now. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.670
 a large grater all rubbed the tester and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.170
 Ham, too, somewhere 300 grams, I'm cutting 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.559
 straws now it all together 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.020
 ham and cheese I will mix and all 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 nothing adding just ham cheese and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.479
 all and mix well, then I will show that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.310
 I will do this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.880
 part of the test did here it turned out 10 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 puffs once two three 4 5 10 layer window 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 bit different sizes so they entered 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.470
 some bigger ones are smaller well somehow 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.970
 uneven to ok ok second part too i 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 so here you see roll out a little bit 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:38.159
 then cut know or parts one 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.939
 I will remove the part and I will work with this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.700
 part 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 too and now i'm just rolling 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 stronger in length and cut like this 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.229
 way like that for a few 34 things 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.649
 I get nutria shot then roll it out 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649
 will show 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.830
 so we continue to see how 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.500
 I roll these parts here cut off 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.229
 it turned a little bit like that pushed 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.220
 it does not stick together you can bend it 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.220
 very convenient now I put ham here 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.020
 cheese and so here I fix the book 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.000
 I'll press a little 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.060
 so that it accommodates the puff pastry and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.560
 a fork like this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.850
 fasten all the edges and fold on 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.550
 baking pan covered with paper 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.770
 for baking here is such a paper so as not to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:44.239
 burned and did not stick to the pan so 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.360
 further the same in general form 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 here these puffs can be differently like 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.959
 do you like any size any 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.390
 picture as you want and more when you 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.330
 put it on the baking sheet i like that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.000
 Sharpen our do cuts I first 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.330
 all folding right then on a baking sheet and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.820
 attack so do such here cuts all 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.010
 so here I am 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.150
 I will put the oven 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 warmed up to 180 degrees and I will put 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.769
 here on 2 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 I put the level I close and cut up 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:50.430
 down at 180 degrees 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:53.879
 bake for 25-30 minutes i switch off like this 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.459
 20 minutes have passed 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.239
 dreamed that they were too red 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.790
 and pulled out and then find some good ones 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.810
 turned out lush I melted 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.220
 some butter and now just 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.239
 every puff I do not like grease the face 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.979
 so I prefer the best creamy 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.729
 Butter kilograms of puffs will get 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.820
 kilograms of puff yeast dough 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.300
 it turns out that this number is one 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.860
 worm 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.490
 I will now remove these puffs and another 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.580
 leaf on the same decompose also 10 stuff 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.030
 time two three 4 5 six 7 8 10 stuff 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.870
 shorter than 20 pieces per kilogram of puff 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.919
 the test turns out here and stayed with me 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.620
 Here it is for the right ham filling 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.900
 with cheese that's the amount of this 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.090
 you can just spread it on bread and 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.530
 heat up the microwaves too 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.229
 hot sandwich here I still want to say 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.360
 stuffing can be done any if anyone 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.620
 interesting i also have a recipe i 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.260
 did the same 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.820
 puff pastry but inside with cottage cheese very 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.729
