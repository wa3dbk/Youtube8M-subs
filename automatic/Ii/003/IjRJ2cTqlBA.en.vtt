if you have a small tree trunk consider

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.240 
if you have a small tree trunk consider
smaller<00:00:53.710> options<00:00:54.310> such<00:00:54.610> as<00:00:54.660> 36<00:00:55.660> inches<00:00:56.110> or<00:00:56.650> 24

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
Moultrie rain and as a result can be

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.710 
Moultrie rain and as a result can be
destroyed<00:01:09.320> by<00:01:09.560> animals<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:11.090> durability<00:01:11.690> of

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
the cocoa mat is not nearly as but the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
price is easily the cocoa mats best

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.530 
price is easily the cocoa mats best
feature<00:01:20.840> they<00:01:21.830> cost<00:01:22.100> about<00:01:22.310> half<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:23.180> much<00:01:23.479> as

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
feature they cost about half as much as

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.530 
feature they cost about half as much as
the<00:01:24.259> whole<00:01:24.470> stream<00:01:24.909> they're<00:01:25.909> also<00:01:26.270> lighter

the whole stream they're also lighter

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.870 
the whole stream they're also lighter
what<00:01:27.229> makes<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.680> easier<00:01:28.100> when<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.700> need<00:01:28.850> to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
what makes it easier when you need to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.719 
what makes it easier when you need to
pick<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.149> up<00:01:29.420> place<00:01:29.899> around<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.409> tree<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.009> may

pick it up place around a tree and may

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.020 
pick it up place around a tree and may
help<00:01:32.000> avoid<00:01:32.360> injuries<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:34.310> price<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.940> the

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
mulch mats can be almost twice as much

they're<00:01:39.259> also<00:01:39.500> heavier<00:01:40.280> which<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> good

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
they're also heavier which is a good

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.020 
they're also heavier which is a good
thing<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.840> many<00:01:42.800> cases<00:01:43.369> however<00:01:43.520> when<00:01:43.880> you're

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
thing in many cases however when you're

but<00:01:49.080> they're<00:01:49.830> much<00:01:50.040> thicker<00:01:50.580> which<00:01:51.390> means

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
but they're much thicker which means

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
but they're much thicker which means
they're<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.860> more<00:01:53.100> durable<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.790> lasts<00:01:54.180> a
