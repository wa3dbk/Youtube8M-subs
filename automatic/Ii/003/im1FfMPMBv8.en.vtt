time<00:01:09.770> maybe<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> few<00:01:11.400> extra<00:01:11.760> times<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
time maybe a few extra times at the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
time maybe a few extra times at the
roots<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.350> those<00:01:13.740> are

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
roots just to make sure those are

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
roots just to make sure those are
straight<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> my

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
for that look you'll see at the end that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
anyways so there's really no need for me

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
anyways so there's really no need for me
to<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> bone<00:01:28.799> straight<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to get it bone straight and also you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
to get it bone straight and also you
know<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> try<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.159> heat<00:01:32.460> as

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
know I try to use as little heat as

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
know I try to use as little heat as
possible<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
possible so I'm just kind of going for a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
possible so I'm just kind of going for a
straight<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.240> necessarily<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> bone

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
straight look not necessarily a bone

00:01:37.320 --> 00:02:34.349 
straight look not necessarily a bone
silky<00:01:38.220> straight<00:01:38.610> smooth<00:01:39.210> look

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.569 

so<00:02:35.359> this<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> comparison<00:02:36.349> shop<00:02:36.829> between<00:02:37.370> how

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
so this is a comparison shop between how

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.429 
so this is a comparison shop between how
my<00:02:37.790> straighten<00:02:38.269> hair<00:02:38.450> looks<00:02:38.810> versus<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
my straighten hair looks versus the

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.530 
my straighten hair looks versus the
blow-dried<00:02:39.980> hair<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.579> posted<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.329> on

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
earlier I'm trying to use as little heat

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.830 
earlier I'm trying to use as little heat
as<00:04:38.620> possible<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.460> maintain<00:04:43.120> my<00:04:43.300> hair<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:43.630> did
