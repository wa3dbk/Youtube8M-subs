they're great for when that's hot on the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.360 
they're great for when that's hot on the
track<00:02:39.860> no<00:02:40.849> higher<00:02:41.299> up<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.140> could<00:02:42.709> encounter

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
track no higher up you could encounter

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.740 
track no higher up you could encounter
snow<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.250> quite<00:02:46.819> cold<00:02:47.299> on<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
snow and it can get quite cold on the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.270 
snow and it can get quite cold on the
track<00:02:47.959> depending<00:02:48.440> on<00:02:48.500> what<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.920> weather's

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
track depending on what the weather's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.470 
track depending on what the weather's
like<00:02:49.359> so<00:02:50.359> higher<00:02:51.319> up<00:02:51.620> around<00:02:52.030> 5,000<00:02:53.030> meters

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
like so higher up around 5,000 meters

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.280 
like so higher up around 5,000 meters
some<00:02:54.319> days<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:55.099> choose<00:02:55.579> to<00:02:56.000> wear<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.540> warmer<00:02:57.019> shoe

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
some days I choose to wear a warmer shoe

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.879 
some days I choose to wear a warmer shoe
it<00:02:57.829> is<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.910> waterproof<00:02:59.660> shoe<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.530> but

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
it is a waterproof shoe so this is but

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.839 
it is a waterproof shoe so this is but
again<00:03:01.519> then<00:03:02.150> line<00:03:02.540> with<00:03:02.870> gore-tex<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.790> it

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
again then line with gore-tex so it

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.250 
again then line with gore-tex so it
makes<00:03:05.090> them<00:03:05.269> waterproof<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.870> then<00:03:05.989> leather

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
makes them waterproof and then leather

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.750 
makes them waterproof and then leather
so<00:03:06.500> they're<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.739> lot<00:03:07.010> warmer

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
so they're a lot warmer

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.670 
so they're a lot warmer
so<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.239> put<00:03:08.450> thick<00:03:08.750> socks<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:09.200> there<00:03:09.380> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
so you can put thick socks in there and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.460 
so you can put thick socks in there and
make<00:03:10.370> them<00:03:10.549> warm<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.150> they'll<00:03:11.750> be<00:03:11.870> waterproof

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
make them warm and they'll be waterproof

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.750 
make them warm and they'll be waterproof
if<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.919> snows<00:03:13.280> now<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.419> use<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.980> chute<00:03:16.340> not<00:03:16.730> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
if it snows now I use just a chute not a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.509 
if it snows now I use just a chute not a
bit<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.599> that's<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.859> because<00:03:19.010> I've<00:03:19.489> got

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
bit and that's just because I've got

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.120 
bit and that's just because I've got
pretty<00:03:19.940> strong<00:03:20.359> ankles<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:21.500> doing<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.889> lot<00:03:21.919> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
pretty strong ankles from doing a lot of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.580 
pretty strong ankles from doing a lot of

really<00:03:28.639> feel<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.419> like<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.139> use<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.680> boot

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
really feel like I like to use a boot

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.729 
really feel like I like to use a boot
until<00:03:31.519> I'm<00:03:31.700> on<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.209> mountain<00:03:32.660> however<00:03:33.500> if

if that's what you're used to and your
ankles<00:03:42.680> might<00:03:42.829> be<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:42.980> little<00:03:43.130> bit<00:03:43.280> weaker<00:03:43.760> then

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
ankles might be a little bit weaker then

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.300 
ankles might be a little bit weaker then

for the trick and just take it straight

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.040 
for the trick and just take it straight
to<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.340> track<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.880> use<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.569> first<00:03:52.840> time

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.770 
to the track and use it the first time
there<00:03:53.319> or<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.160> could<00:03:54.430> get<00:03:54.550> blisters<00:03:54.819> so<00:03:55.540> make

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
there or you could get blisters so make

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.870 
there or you could get blisters so make
sure<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.110> break<00:03:56.500> them<00:03:56.800> in<00:03:56.950> really<00:03:57.730> well

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
sure you break them in really well

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.350 
sure you break them in really well
before<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.390> get<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:59.410> Nepal<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.700> that's<00:04:01.030> the

before you get to Nepal so that's the
two<00:04:01.720> shoes<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:03.269> definitely<00:04:04.269> need<00:04:05.019> to

degrees<00:06:18.560> Celsius<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:20.030> this<00:06:20.570> sleeping<00:06:20.960> bag

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
degrees Celsius so this sleeping bag

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.460 
degrees Celsius so this sleeping bag
goes<00:06:21.320> down<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:22.100> minus<00:06:22.820> 20<00:06:23.090> minus<00:06:23.270> 25<00:06:23.840> it's

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
goes down to minus 20 minus 25 it's

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.390 
goes down to minus 20 minus 25 it's
really<00:06:25.010> warm<00:06:25.600> obviously<00:06:26.600> lower<00:06:26.990> down<00:06:27.410> it's<00:06:28.160> a

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
really warm obviously lower down it's a

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.400
