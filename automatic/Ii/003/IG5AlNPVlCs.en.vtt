half<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
half like what you have this is a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.600 
half like what you have this is a
protector<00:02:29.630> for<00:02:29.810> your<00:02:29.960> screen<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:31.100> only<00:02:31.310> for

protector for your screen it's only for

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.190 
protector for your screen it's only for
your<00:02:31.700> screen<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.060> doesn't<00:02:32.270> protect<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.990> top

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
your screen it doesn't protect the top

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.530 
your screen it doesn't protect the top
where<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.610> mic<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> headphone<00:02:35.510> jack

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
where the mic is in the headphone jack

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.910 
where the mic is in the headphone jack
which<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.580> okay<00:02:37.580> not<00:02:38.150> too<00:02:38.360> great<00:02:38.540> though<00:02:38.920> okay

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
which is okay not too great though okay

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.820 
which is okay not too great though okay
so<00:02:40.340> let's<00:02:40.850> get<00:02:40.970> into<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.240> case<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.380> here's<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
so let's get into the case so here's the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.370 
so let's get into the case so here's the
case<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.190> get<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.460> I've<00:02:43.820> mines<00:02:44.600> them<00:02:44.840> torn

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
case and you get it I've mines them torn

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.820 
case and you get it I've mines them torn
up<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:46.300> yeah<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.530> got<00:02:48.710> this

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
fake iphone thing in there so so here it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
fake iphone thing in there so so here it
comes<00:02:55.640> with<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.030> thing<00:02:56.360> I'll<00:02:56.720> put<00:02:57.380> this

in<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.150> minute<00:02:59.290> here<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> iskin<00:03:01.040> revo<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
in a minute here is the iskin revo to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.750 
in a minute here is the iskin revo to
this<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> silicon<00:03:03.890> case<00:03:03.950> as<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.550> first

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
this is a silicon case as my first

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.540 
this is a silicon case as my first
silicon<00:03:05.150> case<00:03:05.360> I've<00:03:05.480> ever<00:03:05.600> owned<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:07.130> like

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
silicon case I've ever owned it's like

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.990 
silicon case I've ever owned it's like
it's<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.970> weird<00:03:08.210> silicone<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.190> hard<00:03:10.190> like

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
it's a weird silicone it's hard like

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.510 
it's a weird silicone it's hard like
it's<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.450> really<00:03:11.810> really<00:03:12.800> super<00:03:13.100> bendable

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
it's not a really really super bendable

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.090 
it's not a really really super bendable
its<00:03:13.640> bendable<00:03:13.880> right<00:03:14.090> here<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:15.100> yeah

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
its bendable right here but this is yeah

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.400 
its bendable right here but this is yeah
it's<00:03:16.280> definitely<00:03:16.550> tough<00:03:17.090> platt<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:17.840> tough

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
it's definitely tough platt it's tough

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.490 
it's definitely tough platt it's tough
rubber<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.910> nothing<00:03:20.270> that's<00:03:20.360> gonna<00:03:20.540> tear<00:03:21.140> at

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
rubber it's nothing that's gonna tear at

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.720 
rubber it's nothing that's gonna tear at
all<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:23.060> first<00:03:23.690> off<00:03:24.100> what<00:03:25.100> lock<00:03:25.310> people<00:03:25.580> hate

is this is a lint catcher I try to get
this<00:03:30.110> into<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.440> camera<00:03:31.060> with<00:03:32.060> all<00:03:32.150> about<00:03:32.300> lint

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
this into the camera with all about lint

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.410 
this into the camera with all about lint
let's<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.850> put<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.120> your<00:03:35.209> pocket

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
let's just if you put in your pocket

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.530 
let's just if you put in your pocket
it's<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:36.170> nightmare<00:03:36.410> trust<00:03:37.070> me<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:38.180> are<00:03:38.209> going

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.630 
it's a nightmare trust me you are going
to<00:03:38.600> get<00:03:38.750> lint<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:39.470> doesn't<00:03:39.950> come<00:03:40.070> up<00:03:40.160> too<00:03:40.400> well

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
to get lint you doesn't come up too well

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.190 
to get lint you doesn't come up too well
on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.870> camera<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:42.230> yeah<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.680> can<00:03:42.950> see<00:03:43.190> it

here's the case it's got this cool of
you<00:03:50.270> know<00:03:50.360> design<00:03:51.110> right<00:03:51.290> there<00:03:51.500> it's<00:03:51.680> got

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
you know design right there it's got

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.800 
you know design right there it's got
this<00:03:51.920> black<00:03:52.220> rubber<00:03:52.730> which<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.180> more<00:03:53.420> strong

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
this black rubber which is more strong

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.830 
this black rubber which is more strong
and<00:03:54.260> then<00:03:54.770> this<00:03:55.070> blue<00:03:55.370> wrapper<00:03:56.150> which<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.420> not

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and then this blue wrapper which is not

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.320 
and then this blue wrapper which is not
too<00:03:57.140> strong<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:58.730> doesn't<00:03:59.030> something<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.270> do

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
too strong it doesn't something I do

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.290 
too strong it doesn't something I do
like<00:03:59.600> up<00:03:59.840> here<00:03:59.930> though<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.950> has<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.459> to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
cover let me get this up close to you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.320 
cover let me get this up close to you
guys<00:04:08.020> okay<00:04:09.020> so<00:04:09.860> anyways<00:04:10.459> it's<00:04:10.700> got<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.910> cover

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
guys okay so anyways it's got a cover

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.290 
guys okay so anyways it's got a cover
right<00:04:11.600> here<00:04:12.050> for<00:04:12.620> your<00:04:13.400> headphone<00:04:13.760> jack<00:04:14.000> it's

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
right here for your headphone jack it's

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.150 
right here for your headphone jack it's
got<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:14.600> very<00:04:14.930> squishy<00:04:15.350> button<00:04:15.739> for<00:04:16.070> that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
got this very squishy button for that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.890 
got this very squishy button for that
and<00:04:16.489> also<00:04:17.270> protects<00:04:17.810> down<00:04:17.959> here<00:04:19.390> for<00:04:20.390> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
and also protects down here for the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.710 
and also protects down here for the
docking<00:04:21.289> port<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:23.000> that's<00:04:23.330> pretty<00:04:23.510> much<00:04:23.600> it

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
docking port so that's pretty much it

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.320 
docking port so that's pretty much it
for<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.140> case

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
for the case

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.730
