00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 two 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.630
 and the hygiene of chinchillas' hair 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.330
 It is a very important activity that 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 you have to keep in mind is going to be a 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.050
 animal that will not be comfortable if not 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.289
 he has his hair very clean 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.250
 for this they can do it to themselves 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.140
 for it 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.710
 you know that they exist in the market 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.710
 Different types of bath sand 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.949
 chinchillas what is this that you are 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.110
 watching there but this video goes so that 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.659
 we show ourselves how you can 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.170
 to bathe and how to brush your hair 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.329
 the chinchillas there are dry shampoos that 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.000
 we will try to avoid that they fall into the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.090
 face to see if it is a little quiet 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.360
 fat vale plus chinchillas are animals 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.370
 very nervous you know 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.930
 then we will choose when it calms down 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.710
 a bit there I think that more or less 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 we're going to take dry shampoo and we're going 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.570
 to sprinkle well over 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.870
 this shampoo also in 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.540
 when we start using it 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.930
 Let's start brushing, it's going to help us 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.550
 Remove all dead hair from the animal 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.800
 concretely this is the first time that 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.420
 we're going to do this chinchilla myself 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.550
 I wanted to recreate the problems a bit 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.260
 that you will usually find because 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.790
 then the chinchillas get used to 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.790
 it is becoming easier to do it 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.420
 and now I'm going to show you the amount of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 hair that we have managed to remove fixes 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.759
 we go there with the second session always 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.240
 we recommend giving it a couple of times 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.240
 shampoo 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 all this hair that you see that falls does not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.380
 worry because it really is hair 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.929
 dead in the animal the hair that is capable 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.569
 to come out that easy without us having 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 than to use ourselves thoroughly to withdraw him 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.800
 It is a hair that really is already 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.069
 a hair that is dead is a hair that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.959
 It is convenient that it is outside the animal 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.120
 as it is the first time that we are only 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.510
 doing this chinchilla is that it comes out 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 quite a lot of hair if you see that it 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.430
 Stress too much especially 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.549
 first times we must stop it is worth 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.859
 a technique that makes the animal up 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.329
 that does not get used to scare and 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.950
 basically scared not because he 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.799
 let's hurt because we do it very 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 gently but for the simple fact of 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.200
 have to be grabbed and held 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.019
 to any animal that is prey as in 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.900
 this case they like to be subject because 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.000
 they are subjected and they are vulnerable is 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.620
 important that after we have 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.939
 done these brushing jobs 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.819
 which are unpleasant for the animal 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.440
 We finish with a reward always 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.980
 let's give a prize worth at the end 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.430
 I will not stress it more simply 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.430
 let's remove all this hairball 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.020
 that we have removed it 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.210
 and we will tell you another important thing that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.900
 we must also do a little bit 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.870
 us and it is the filing of the nails 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.480
 use nail file of person is worth and 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.250
 the same thing I tell you the first times 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.250
 it's going to cost a lot to adapt 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.350
 to cheer up my nails and when they are very 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.370
 little girls 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.510
 They have very short nails and do not 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 we can file too much 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.750
 are procedures that until the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.480
 animal is not used because you 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.630
 they cost a bit to get used to because 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.070
 obviously they are unpleasant and 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.990
 besides the animals are found 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.590
 subjects and submitted 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.120
 finally we are going to after having the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.390
 brushed and everything we're going to put a 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.440
 little bit of cologne above and we 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.410
 you have seen it done in some other 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.200
 animal removes the body odor makes 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.300
 more pleasant stay at home you can 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.560
 use the also remember in the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 same cage 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.440
 and we leave it free to enjoy 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.479
 and explain to you the sand the sand is very 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.539
 important that he be in the cage every day 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.090
 they really enjoy baths 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.590
 You can put sand in a bowl 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.930
 basically like this one or whatever you want in 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.030
 a little dish in a bowl that is what 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.009
 big enough you put so 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.630
 minus two or three fingers of sand and go to 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.560
 watch as they wallow for 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.630
 Keep your hair healthy and bright and not 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.039
 caked they really enjoy the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.840
 sand baths and you will find them 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.030
 almost all of the pet stores 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.710
 that have product for chinchilla vais 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.060
 to see that the sand is one of the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.330
 star products that are used a 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.330
 heap
