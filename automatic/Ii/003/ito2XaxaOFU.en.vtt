00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello what we need to know before 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 embark on a long journey by car 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
 we see some with our dog 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 suggestions that could be there 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 useful some dogs suffer from car sickness 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 as we suffer from seasickness me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
 it is precisely the nausea and the doctor 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.199
 veterinarian can help them by prescribing them 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 of the drugs on purpose that make them 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.600
 feel better we can help them too 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.570
 driving not too sharply then 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.490
 more gently possible and making them 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 travel on an empty stomach 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 it is also important to get the dog used to it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.469
 gradually to travel by car 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.960
 starting from short journeys e 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.270
 furthermore, stretching them further is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.300
 It is also important to associate 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 car enjoyable experiences like 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 the arrival at the park where he meets the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 friends go to visit the grandparents who 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.610
 they certainly don't go to see 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 vet giving him the vaccination 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 here is not an association 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 positive we have to pay a lot 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.219
 attention to temperature 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.530
 first, travel not in the longest hours 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.899
 hot so maybe early in the morning or 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 in the evening use curtains 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.060
 parasol to repair the passenger compartment do 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 attention air conditioning why 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.830
 the sudden changes in temperature 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.530
 they are dangerous to leave perhaps the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 window a little open but without 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 leave the dog the possibility of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.820
 stick out your head because 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 otherwise it would risk otitis 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.259
 we can bring a wet towel 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 to refresh it and we can also 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.369
 leave him a bowl of water nearby 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.860
 they invented these beautiful ones 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.869
 Travel bowls can be left 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 in the car and also with movements 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.790
 abrupt the water does not come out 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 regular stops because the dog needs it 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.830
 to stretch to do goods needs 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.580
 relax for a moment and then we will too 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.979
 we need 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.290
 I recommend it during non- stops 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.270
 never leave the dog in the car alone 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.040
 because in no time the car 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.740
 reaches very high temperatures 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.530
 and the dog and risk heatstroke e 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.450
 the true mental comfort death we can 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.119
 leave them his cover which he uses a 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.460
 home that with its smell its game 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.979
 also something to chew is preferred 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.530
 like a hong buffalo skin bone 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 kong where the dog must stay during 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.440
 travel 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.239
 the important thing is that it does not constitute 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.380
 a danger that you are getting in the way of 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.140
 guide carry on the back seat 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.209
 secured with a belt like this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 which has a hook on one side 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.160
 attack for example the bib and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.280
 on the other side a ray like that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.680
 of our seat belt or 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.709
 pass in the trunk is space a 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.080
 sufficiency separated by a network or 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.239
 still can stay in a pet carrier in a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.850
 kennel the important thing is that he has the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.500
 chance to turn on itself I hope 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.510
 to have told him everything if I were 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.799
 forget something you suggest me you 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.799
 see you soon. Bye
