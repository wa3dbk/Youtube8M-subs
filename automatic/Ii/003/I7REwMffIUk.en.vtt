00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello in this video will be 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.100
 reviewed one of my gym workouts 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.170
 lying down 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 I will try to explain to you each 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 exercises as well as those goals 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.080
 prosecuted while doing my 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.920
 training usually starts with 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 good overall workout 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.300
 lasting about 15 minutes after 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.359
 what are the main training 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.100
 exercise u is equal to dosing day 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.550
 first exercises are done easy 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.039
 squat 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 the purpose of my squat complex is the first 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.109
 maintaining leg tone second stimulation 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
 hormonal surge and third 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 an increase in the volume of the chest namely 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 for this reason I perform deep 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.340
 squats 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.140
 besides, easy squat worry 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.170
 training is an opportunity well 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 stretch many offered him a bench press 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 correct technique bench press 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.320
 involves the active inclusion of the legs 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 which make a significant contribution 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 success abstinence as follows 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 exercise is the basic basic 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 bench press forests should be carefully 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 looping up picking up the load 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 so that all work approaches in 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.100
 polarity is easy 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.869
 from substantial reserves place 70 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 kilograms and not close for 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 me heavy nevertheless exactly 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 basic bench press to give a sign of a major 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 push increase strength 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.369
 macro looping is a powerful tool 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.619
 dosing load 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.329
 and any training program in 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.390
 powerlifting involves drawing up 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.670
 plan and approximate selection of working scales 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.100
 notice that in no book 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.679
 Powerlifting no recommendation 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.439
 to press or otherwise move into failure 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.369
 always follows a specific percentage 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.140
 or hold a selection of weight winner kpsh 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.240
 the number of lifts headquarters macro 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 cycling allows the athlete to not 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 overload the muscles and ligaments thereby 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.440
 avoiding significant damage 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.899
 muscle fibers it allows not only 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.119
 avoid injuries but also fully 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.819
 recover perform along with 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.110
 heavy also among vole toning 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.689
 windows green movement 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.849
 besides, the athlete should constantly 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.310
 train your speed 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.049
 under speed training can also 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.599
 be allocated a separate day which 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.160
 completely makes no sense if allowed 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.430
 reverse load limit 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.769
 previous workouts you can 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.440
 see that all the main approaches in the press 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.109
 lying performed by me lecturers technology 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 many are interested in the technique of my post 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.150
 which involve oncoming traffic 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.870
 to the bar at the time of lowering and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.000
 maximum distance 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.190
 where is the flu by leaving when 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.989
 approaching the dead center this 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.299
 allows you to make movement in more 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.310
 powerful as well as effectively accelerates 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.500
 barbell breaking into a dead center with 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.700
 less effort 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.560
 last repetition in approach i 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.959
 try to carry put the barbell on 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.629
 chest where performing a blow in motionless 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.370
 greeks relaxed hands it allows 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.769
 additionally load the ligaments as well 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.099
 increase their adaptation to dynamic 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.099
 loads 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 notice the fifth final 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.960
 approach but the movement is still easy 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 powerful present good stock none 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.160
 less training stress is enough 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.260
 in order to stimulate adaptation 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.110
 cartoon load but at the same time not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.840
 overload them 5 sets six times 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.880
 this 30 lifting barbell what for this 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 weight is my personal training 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.080
 Record this Nasty thing that weight is easy 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.200
 speaks about the proper preparation 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.720
 motorcycle training following 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.370
 the auxiliary exercise is strong 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.410
 designed to develop skill 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.570
 competitive live on small woods 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.810
 main validity criterion here 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.959
 technically impeccable movement 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.550
 providing easy and powerful lifting 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.040
 I was not quite in the first departure on 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.930
 180 kilograms as not got on 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.450
 broke up the barbell late relaxed 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.090
 it made many drag upwards and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.980
 deprived of the movement power task of singles 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.350
 the training process is thorough 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.300
 competitive processing 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.640
 tournament mates as much as possible 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.360
 realize the existing speed-power 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.230
 potential 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.060
 but the approach is 190 despite 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920
 weight gain was enough 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.810
 quick and easy as possible 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.270
 technically more correct to perform 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.770
 lowering and positive phase on the background 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.810
 fatigue after the main bench 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.330
 affectively drops to 20-30 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.970
 percent however one should not forget that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.210
 the main goal of the ksivu is speeding 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.800
 which was carried out door-to-hours 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.840
 first approach at 200 is the apogee 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.060
 some kind of technical stupidity 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.160
 allow having carried out more or less 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.170
 I lost all my quality 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.570
 speed mid that drive yakov 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.730
 greased movements and pronounced in 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.690
 worldly point which me is in 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.970
 triceps in phase II 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.400
 I decided to correct technical mistakes you 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.400
 would be another approach to the lethal version 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.300
 the second approach at 200 was to perform 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.790
 technically much more correct than 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.730
 1 if the first approach is in place 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.160
 evaded the court maximum weight then I'm on 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.930
 brought up to 3 luck and spoiled the attempts on 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.650
 the final final single was 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.169
 can approach 200 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.030
 all shorter 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.280
 stop than usually allowed on 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.070
 competitions and it became main 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.870
 technical error in the rest of the approach 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.870
 turned out in the role of amen and and almost not 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.789
 the main part of the workout is done 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.580
 the following passive exercise is 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.770
 bench press and power frame which 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.560
 aimed at the development of night and fusion 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.630
 movements so they are performed with a very 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.210
 got along with us the main thing 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.030
 will settle all approaches with high speed and 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.030
 allowing for delays along the way 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.240
 I'm deliberately missing the rest of the approaches 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.200
 in the movement data so as not to delay 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.510
 video 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.580
 however, I note that the other three approaches 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.430
 no different from the first 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.930
 which can be seen on the video data 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.180
 the main goal even his within the framework of this 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.060
 training is the development of power and speed 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.280
 against the background of the one in fatigue which muscles 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.770
 received during the base press and singles 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.330
 any work on force is excessive 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.030
 stress and become significant 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.800
 obstacle recovery past 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.410
 the final exercise is the download 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.120
 triceps on the block with moderate weight want 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.130
 express my deep gratitude to your 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.870
 coach hen victor for valuable 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.150
 instruction and guidance 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.220
 federation in pcl 5c for the opportunity 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.990
 do your favorite sport in the same way 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.880
 thank you honda walls to anton who 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.110
 wrote down my training approaches 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.110
 goodbye
