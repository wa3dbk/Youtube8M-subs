00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
yes on a bit of plastic board never cut

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.429 
yes on a bit of plastic board never cut
it<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:23.220> porous<00:02:24.220> surface<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.970> wood<00:02:25.439> because

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
it on a porous surface like wood because

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.289 
it on a porous surface like wood because
it<00:02:26.560> will<00:02:26.709> absorb<00:02:26.829> all<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> flavors<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:28.120> not

only that well it's all over the texture

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.750 
only that well it's all over the texture
so<00:02:31.689> what<00:02:31.840> we're<00:02:31.989> gonna<00:02:32.049> do<00:02:32.379> is<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:33.159> trim<00:02:33.579> this
