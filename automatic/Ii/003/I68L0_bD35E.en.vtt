00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello very good to all that for 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.620
 I'm the steakhouse and today I'm 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.180
 here to bring you a new analysis now 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.100
 you know a new analysis of sixth 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.200
 generation always watching her tiber of 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.570
 over just right now how can you be 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.550
 seeing is about two states a pokémon 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.350
 that surprised me a lot if 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.530
 You have seen my video about combat 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.780
 come on the team fight tribute to 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.220
 tweets plays pokemon will you know what good 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.460
 I commented a little bit that shoes is not a 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.440
 pokémon that for say two months 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.020
 back was not used much however 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.730
 its use has increased considerably 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.019
 and the truth does not surprise me because it 's a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.879
 pokémon that has surprised me a lot 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.190
 is a pokémon that at a level is very very 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.140
 good and the truth is that it has a set 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.539
 let's say more than surprising 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.980
 rather not that it's a defensive set the 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.899
 ps how can you be seeing now by 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.460
 the base stands are two at least 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.409
 stretches the worst thing you have is the defense 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.899
 physicist who has only 85 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.329
 however shoes with a defensive set 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.519
 physical is very very good indeed that set 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.870
 has been the one that catapulted him 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.400
 directly to over just so I think 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.470
 that it was worth it no more than 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 nothing analyzed two comments a couple 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 of sets and more than anything so good that you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 encourage to use this little 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 because the truth is being or is 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 being quite used never just and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.439
 Come on it's worth it because it's a very pokemon 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.509
 very good so nothing good you know 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.399
 that I before talking about what 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.110
 the strategy is the musel the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.789
 distribution of nature and so on 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.259
 I like to talk a little about the 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.119
 skill that this pokemon is going to have in 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.009
 this case to balances your combination of 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.929
 types and their base states well the 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.490
 skill is going to be pressure has 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.079
 lightning rod of hidden ability without 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.039
 But I have to tell you that he has not yet 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.469
 come out ok 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.789
 Reynosa if you find a match with the 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.039
 ability for rays the safest thing is 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.360
 which is somewhat legal, so the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.890
 skill that you will only be able to have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 our acts is going to be pressure that 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.789
 good pressure will come quite 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 good especially for the defensive sab 2 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.750
 physical since it's going to make the pepes 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 of the opponent go down earlier so good if 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 we have a physical defensive factor that 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.849
 it's going to be one of the sets I'm going to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.289
 Commenting not spend as bad as 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.209
 Well, it's going to help a little bit 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.770
 is the work of these and well 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.170
 because the combination of types is kind 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.670
 level electric flight is one of the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.040
 better combinations right now that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.810
 there in pokemon has only two 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 weaknesses that's pretty good for 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.590
 a defensive pokémon that are weakness to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.980
 ice and weakness to rock weakness to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.650
 rock a bit annoying 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.180
 because rock traps make it 25% of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 damage but it is good however neither 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.860
 it is so much and then it presents 5 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.810
 resistances in an immunity that is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.450
 very well it's worth in our cars is going to be 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.840
 resistant to plant type to fight type 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.790
 to steel type to bug type and type 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.069
 flying and you will be immune to the land type 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.959
 so you already see with five resistances 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 an immunity and only two weaknesses 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.340
 so many is a very good defensive pokémon 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 and pretty well compensated the studs 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.420
 they are also very compensated as we take 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
 as you can see by the part 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.769
 of the bull that has 90 of life 85 of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.220
 defense and 90 special defense which 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.540
 because nothing gives you a bull of I think 88 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.280
 of mediaguas and that is a bull 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 above average is not bad at all 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 a bull that is pretty good and good 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.950
 because on the offensive side it has 90 of 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.829
 attack that is fine however we do not 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.379
 interesting 125 special attack that is 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.569
 very well and speed 100 we say 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.190
 speed 100 is the minimum speed that 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.290
 he has to have an offensive pokémon 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.540
 if you want to have a super pokémon 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.609
 offensive less than speed 100 base 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.829
 it is considered in quotation marks 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.940
 slow so speed 100 let's say that 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.260
 it's like the joust 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.910
 just and necessary that you need this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.310
 factor for another being that arises to 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.620
 comment that it's an offensive 2 so 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.080
 good codes are very balanced a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.700
 great combination of types a good attack 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.200
 special and the necessary speed suitable 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360
 it presents itself as much as a large tank 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 physical as a good special attacker the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.470
 first very sets is the museum that I've 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.300
 commented before the physical tank that goes 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.460
 to take to clear to remove from you know 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.070
 tines traps rocks etcetera spark 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.110
 online already and I breathe on the other hand the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.380
 second much that I present to you is of a 2 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.330
 let's say super special special attacker 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.880
 with respite hidden power of ice type 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.650
 ray and sling igneous and good as well as the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.150
 advice not faces of this analysis anymore 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.220
 that nothing you have in mind six 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.230
 offensive with chosen glasses or handkerchief 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.790
 elected and volt change since so many 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.290
 can be quite surprising especially with 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.570
 some glasses chosen and well then with 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.070
 volt change it gives quite a game so 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.480
 nothing we are going to present let's go I'm going to 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.100
 present now a little how are the 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.470
 nude set the nature and the cast of 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 eps the first museum not in very simple 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.950
 of the physical tank the skill that goes to 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.390
 bring more expression objects remains and 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.970
 with a great combination of types like 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.500
 I commented before a decent book and 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.230
 a nature oriented to the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.760
 defending 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.770
 I present you so many with this set of 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.150
 defensive tank clearing serves for 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.250
 remove the annoying rocks and then from 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.810
 our field I breathe to restore 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.220
 health and power this will make you already know that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.420
 this is what I told you before 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.430
 does he also summoned in his skill 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.350
 pressure and good because they are ethnic 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.270
 spark as as offensive as for 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.000
 doing a lot of damage is used the spark 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.310
 instead of lightning for its 30% paralyze 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.410
 not like it's a defensive pokémon let's say 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.510
 that has the ability to be able 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.250
 paralyze 30% the times is enough 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.380
 well let's not say that the spark would be 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.360
 like scalding quotes instead of 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.130
 burn then paralyze and well then the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.990
 nature is going to be daring and the cast 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.570
 of those I will present two different 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.940
 It's going to take full defense always 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.040
 however then we're going to have to 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.460
 choose between four special attack and 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.520
 full life 252 in life or attack 56 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 special and 200 of life because more than 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.530
 nothing is to answer the need of 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.030
 give one hit that I wa vision you already know 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.770
 that visar is going to be the pokemon now 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.440
 same is being the pokemon that 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.270
 used to counteract the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.480
 pokemon that use default is worth 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.430
 pokemon that use clear then 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.120
 let's say the cast from below with 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.710
 56 special attack I think it has a 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.170
 70% chance to give one hit that 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.700
 joe with wave and yet the one above 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.790
 I think he's thirty-something 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.560
 hundred then more than nothing is for 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.690
 end visas in one fell swoop it 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.310
 If you want to do away with visas single 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.290
 hit 70 percent of the time more 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.810
 or less then take the sets from below 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.880
 however if it gives you a little bit the same, 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.400
 because pisa is really going to fall two 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.750
 hits then pick them up the cast from 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.610
 up the one that only takes four in 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.620
 special attack and good with the second 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.300
 set which is that of the special attacker the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.580
 skill base pressure object life 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.350
 sphere and then with the right speed and 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.600
 a good special attack I present this 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.340
 super offensive set for so many lightning 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.350
 as main attack of this or malley 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.120
 hidden power and ice by hedges and 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.770
 I breathe more than anything to regenerate 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.690
 health and nature will be 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.700
 scary to be as fast we go what 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.100
 as fast as possible that we can and good 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.830
 Well the eps are going to go 252 so much attack 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.090
 special like at speed and 4 life like that 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.740
 how good this has been all I hope that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.300
 you have liked the analysis has been like this 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.610
 please give a like to subscribe from 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.540
 it really helps a lot and well little 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.730
 plus 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.430
 I will leave more than anything I have been 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.690
 using fat 2 because more than anything 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.220
 I really recommend you to use it 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.650
 because it is a very good pokémon is a 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.110
 pokémon that I already tell you has been catapulted 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.000
 to one of the we will be using a 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.290
 heap in over just about everything for this 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.420
 set that I have told you the first of 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.420
 they do not physical tank since it has 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.650
 replaced the mouse as pokemon 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.390
 defensive physical type already 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.300
 that cap 2 is much better than rotating a 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.550
 defensive physical as it has clear and 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.140
 can be cured with respite so good 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.670
 In general, this has been all 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.020
 I really hope you liked it if you have 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.660
 been well to give the former to subscribe you has 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.840
 there was a lot and little else come up 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.840
