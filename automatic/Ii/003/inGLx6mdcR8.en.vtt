and we end up winning this game about

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
and we end up winning this game about
1.2<00:01:06.000> 2v3<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.290> running<00:01:07.380> high<00:01:07.650> streaks

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
1.2 2v3 and we were running high streaks

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
1.2 2v3 and we were running high streaks
I'm<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.119> sure<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.479> running<00:01:09.750> but

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I'm not sure what they were running but

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.940 
I'm not sure what they were running but
they<00:01:09.960> weren't<00:01:10.200> running<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.560> swarm<00:01:10.799> or

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
they weren't running like swarm or

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
they weren't running like swarm or
anything<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> pretty

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
anything so you know it was a pretty

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.550 
anything so you know it was a pretty
solid<00:01:13.710> gameplay<00:01:14.070> overall<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.259> unique

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
solid gameplay overall it's a bit unique

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.870 
solid gameplay overall it's a bit unique
I<00:01:16.680> guess<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> fact<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> were<00:01:17.670> running

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
I guess in the fact that were running

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
I guess in the fact that were running
high<00:01:18.090> streaks<00:01:18.540> cuz<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.080> something<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
high streaks cuz that's something you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
high streaks cuz that's something you
guys<00:01:19.470> don't<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
guys don't really see I don't know I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.730 
guys don't really see I don't know I
think<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:21.750> two<00:01:21.960> sets<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.350> dogs<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
think I've got two sets of dogs and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.929 
think I've got two sets of dogs and
swarm<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.220> kids<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:23.850> I'm

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
swarm on these kids I don't know if I'm

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
swarm on these kids I don't know if I'm
not<00:01:24.030> sure<00:01:24.090> maybe<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.689> set<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.439> sets

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
not sure maybe one set I think two sets

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
not sure maybe one set I think two sets
though<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:27.000> he<00:01:27.180> dropped<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.900> he
