you<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.690> highly<00:00:36.989> recommend<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you get it we highly recommend that you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
you get it we highly recommend that you
either<00:00:38.489> order<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> our<00:00:39.420> kits<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:40.469> do

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
either order one of our kits or do

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
either order one of our kits or do
something<00:00:40.800> similar<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
something similar when you get it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959 
something similar when you get it
because<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.140> Ziploc<00:00:44.040> containers<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.610> sealed

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
because the Ziploc containers are sealed

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
because the Ziploc containers are sealed
shop<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:45.960> ship<00:00:46.200> better<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.890> but

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shop so they ship better that way but

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
shop so they ship better that way but
you're<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> air<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you're gonna want a little bit of air in

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.740 
you're gonna want a little bit of air in
your<00:00:49.800> spring<00:00:50.039> tail<00:00:50.190> cultures<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
your spring tail cultures because the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740 
your spring tail cultures because the
molding<00:00:52.500> food<00:00:53.280> will<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:54.030> create<00:00:54.210> co2

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
molding food will actually create co2

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
molding food will actually create co2
and<00:00:54.930> you'll<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.110> gas<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> spring<00:00:55.949> tails

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and you'll actually gas the spring tails

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
and you'll actually gas the spring tails
so<00:00:56.430> recommend<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.690> not

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
so recommend something that's not

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.910 
so recommend something that's not
tight-fitting<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:59.180> the<00:01:00.180> 6<00:01:00.539> quart<00:01:01.020> Sterlite

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tight-fitting like the 6 quart Sterlite

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
tight-fitting like the 6 quart Sterlite
or<00:01:02.160> Rubbermaid<00:01:02.550> containers<00:01:03.120> work<00:01:03.300> great<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
or Rubbermaid containers work great with

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.490 
or Rubbermaid containers work great with
the<00:01:04.850> latches<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> side<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> still

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the latches on the side but it's still

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
the latches on the side but it's still
not<00:01:07.740> super<00:01:08.250> tight<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.000> airs<00:01:09.840> on

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
not super tight so it actually airs on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
not super tight so it actually airs on
all<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.030> when<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> culture

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
all that and when you get the culture

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
all that and when you get the culture
the<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> set<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> kit<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the way that you set up the kit is you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.450 
the way that you set up the kit is you
take<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> complete<00:01:16.380> culture

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.060 

then<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.420> take<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.900> charcoal<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:27.860> comes

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
then you take the charcoal that comes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:47.709 
then you take the charcoal that comes
with<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.310> spring<00:01:28.610> tail<00:01:28.790> culture<00:01:29.240> kit

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:54.160 

all<00:01:48.719> in<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.469> get<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> lid<00:01:50.280> shot

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
little bit goes a long way with these

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.160 
little bit goes a long way with these
guys<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.590> when<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.849> put<00:02:23.849> all<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.209> stuff<00:02:24.959> in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
guys so when you put all the stuff in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.210 
guys so when you put all the stuff in
the<00:02:25.260> container<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.769> gonna<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.160> add

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the container you're gonna want to add

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.430 
the container you're gonna want to add
some<00:02:26.640> water<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.329> you<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:27.930> want<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.140> fill<00:02:28.319> up

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
some water and you don't want to fill up

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.150 
some water and you don't want to fill up
about<00:02:28.739> an<00:02:28.920> inch<00:02:29.599> on<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.780> side<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> spring

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
about an inch on the side of the spring

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.530 
about an inch on the side of the spring
cattle<00:02:32.489> culture<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.390> want

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
cattle culture and you're going to want

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
cattle culture and you're going to want
to<00:02:33.599> keep<00:02:33.840> an<00:02:34.410> inch<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.799> water<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
to keep an inch of water in here in the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
to keep an inch of water in here in the
spring<00:02:36.660> tale<00:02:36.810> culture<00:02:37.349> because<00:02:37.980> springtails

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
spring tale culture because springtails

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.240 
spring tale culture because springtails
need<00:02:38.700> about<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> hundred<00:02:39.390> percent<00:02:39.480> humidity<00:02:40.250> so

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
need about a hundred percent humidity so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.530 
need about a hundred percent humidity so
that's<00:02:41.430> why<00:02:41.549> they<00:02:41.670> lives<00:02:41.910> right<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that's why they lives right there in the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110 
that's why they lives right there in the
substrate<00:02:43.019> where<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.349> stays<00:02:43.560> moist<00:02:43.970> add<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
substrate where it stays moist add the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960 
substrate where it stays moist add the
water<00:02:45.329> I'm<00:02:46.260> gonna<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.739> about<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.250> pinch<00:02:47.639> of

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
water I'm gonna use about a pinch of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.690 
water I'm gonna use about a pinch of
food<00:02:48.900> once<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.530> week<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.549> see

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
food once a week and then when you see

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.039 
food once a week and then when you see
the<00:02:50.790> food<00:02:50.970> disappear<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.569> don't<00:02:51.750> want<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.930> add

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
the food disappear you don't want to add

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.080 
the food disappear you don't want to add
more<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.799> also<00:02:52.920> use<00:02:53.280> uncooked<00:02:53.850> white

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
more you can also use uncooked white

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.050 
more you can also use uncooked white
rice<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:55.049> couscous<00:02:55.650> or<00:02:55.920> even<00:02:56.430> vegetable

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
rice or couscous or even vegetable

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940 
rice or couscous or even vegetable
scraps<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.569> there<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.560> want<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.829> make<00:02:58.920> sure

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
scraps in there just want to make sure

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.920 
scraps in there just want to make sure
that<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> don't<00:02:59.370> over<00:02:59.609> feed<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.569> else<00:03:00.870> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that you don't over feed or else you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.400 
that you don't over feed or else you
have<00:03:00.959> gas<00:03:01.170> out<00:03:02.239> now<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.600> think<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.139> spring

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
have gas out now I think if the spring

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.770 
have gas out now I think if the spring
tail<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.769> out<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.489> your<00:03:05.790> area<00:03:06.209> there's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
tail is out of here in your area there's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.780 
tail is out of here in your area there's
a<00:03:06.810> few<00:03:07.019> ways<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.709> one<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.639> can

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
a few ways to do that one is you can

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
a few ways to do that one is you can
stick<00:03:09.060> something<00:03:09.359> on<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> leaf<00:03:10.530> or

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
stick something on there like a leaf or

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.750 
stick something on there like a leaf or
a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.849> branch<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:13.500> wood<00:03:13.920> something<00:03:14.579> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
a little branch of wood something that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.069 
a little branch of wood something that
the<00:03:14.910> spring<00:03:15.120> cells<00:03:15.299> can<00:03:15.450> crawl<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:15.989> then

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
the spring cells can crawl in and then

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.960 
the spring cells can crawl in and then
you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.290> use<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.799> tap<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.130> out<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.730> by

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you can use that to tap it out but by

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
you can use that to tap it out but by
far<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.540> easiest<00:03:18.569> way<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.170> do<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:19.980> to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
far the easiest way to do it is just to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520 
far the easiest way to do it is just to
add<00:03:20.459> more<00:03:20.790> water<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> keys<00:03:22.290> with

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
add more water and one of the keys with

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.659 
add more water and one of the keys with
the<00:03:22.620> water<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.950> you're<00:03:23.069> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.280> want<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.519> use

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
the water is you're going to want to use

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.330 
the water is you're going to want to use
bottled<00:03:24.209> water<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:25.200> chlorine<00:03:25.650> will

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
bottled water because chlorine will

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.860 
bottled water because chlorine will
definitely<00:03:26.819> kill<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> spring<00:03:27.419> tail<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
definitely kill the spring tail so you

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.879 
definitely kill the spring tail so you
add<00:03:28.049> extra<00:03:28.650> water<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.840> then<00:03:30.889> springtails

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
add extra water and then springtails

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.490 
add extra water and then springtails
float<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.630> way<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.959> feed<00:03:34.200> them<00:03:34.319> out

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
float so the way that you feed them out

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.250 
float so the way that you feed them out
is<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.919> just<00:03:35.069> tip<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.870> then<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.959> pour<00:03:37.230> out

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
is you just tip it and then you pour out

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.960 
is you just tip it and then you pour out
some<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.769> water<00:03:37.950> into<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> container<00:03:38.459> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
some of the water into the container so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.909 
some of the water into the container so
I<00:03:39.030> got<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> tub<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> frogs<00:03:40.260> here<00:03:42.680> give<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.859> a

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
I got a tub of frogs here give them a

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.850 
I got a tub of frogs here give them a
snack<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.400> some<00:03:44.790> spring<00:03:45.120> tails

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
snack of some spring tails

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.850 
snack of some spring tails
take<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.670> container<00:03:47.210> just<00:03:51.880> like<00:03:52.880> that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
take the container just like that

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.560 
take the container just like that
now<00:03:54.860> they<00:03:55.190> springtails<00:03:55.670> some<00:03:56.030> will<00:03:56.150> beaten<00:03:56.450> by

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
now they springtails some will beaten by

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.780 
now they springtails some will beaten by
the<00:03:56.630> frogs<00:03:57.230> but<00:03:57.530> some<00:03:57.710> of<00:03:57.860> them<00:03:58.010> will<00:03:58.370> burrow

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
the frogs but some of them will burrow

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.890 
the frogs but some of them will burrow
down<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.420> substrate

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
down to the substrate

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.080 
down to the substrate
continue<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.470> reproduce<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.790> they'll<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.060> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
continue to reproduce and they'll have a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.610 
continue to reproduce and they'll have a
steady<00:04:02.360> stream<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.810> spring<00:04:03.200> kills<00:04:03.410> right

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
steady stream of spring kills right

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.100 
steady stream of spring kills right
there

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.020 

two<00:04:10.710> types<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.160> springtails<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.820> we<00:04:11.880> saw

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
two types of springtails that we saw

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.330 
two types of springtails that we saw

they could stay pretty cool and they'll

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.390 
they could stay pretty cool and they'll
produce<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.290> lot<00:04:50.470> better<00:04:50.680> outside<00:04:50.980> of<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400
