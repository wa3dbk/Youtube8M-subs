00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.110
 here I say that it is impossible by itself 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.480
 years of taxes 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.110
 it never coincides with what you do or 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.910
 at least 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 what you give is indispensable for 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.820
 survive I have to write 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.650
 the coffee 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 inside a door 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.970
 a twisted mind melts stability that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.610
 a sort of seamstress who sewed every 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.740
 wounded by a neighbor I beg you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600

 evil in a shooting thoughts on paper 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 drive out that it's not rubbish 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.140
 I am discovering my fear by living 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm worse but better better than worse 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 you were there yesterday when not yet 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 I knew who you were wrapped in mine 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 forbidden wishes on shores still 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 strangers if you don't arrive already you know 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.550
 of what I speak, among other things, one of these 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.440
 days I leave without a trace 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.750
 I put more strength in a language look 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.060
 arms singing loudly that a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.550
 moments that explodes on the face 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 the room in the condition that I 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.110
 like the distance from this place from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.240
 this dinner at all costs in mind 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.780
 sincerely every memory has been 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.659
 removed the must 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.940
 I would like to disappear sometimes but sometimes 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.130
 when I run away from everything without why 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.280
 to change mood as long as sunny fields 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.659
 because to change life is not enough to 24 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.960
 hours to change mood 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.090

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.239
 ceiling 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.970

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.980
 Recommended oriented circle design 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.739

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.320
