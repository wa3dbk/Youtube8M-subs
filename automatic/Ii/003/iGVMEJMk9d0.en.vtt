Portage's in BOS you and then into Maya
for<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:13.750> VFX<00:00:14.170> part<00:00:14.440> so<00:00:15.219> we<00:00:16.000> have<00:00:16.150> this<00:00:16.330> sin<00:00:16.779> I

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
for the VFX part so we have this sin I

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.580 
for the VFX part so we have this sin I
will<00:00:18.370> be<00:00:18.490> providing<00:00:18.700> this<00:00:19.150> footage<00:00:19.780> to<00:00:20.410> you

for<00:01:26.859> the<00:01:27.039> garden<00:01:27.549> sequence<00:01:27.939> unit<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.840> know<00:01:29.020> one

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
for the garden sequence unit to know one

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.560 
for the garden sequence unit to know one
thing<00:01:29.229> i<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.500> their<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:33.070> has<00:01:33.420> two<00:01:34.420> or

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
thing i just put their one has two or

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.889 
thing i just put their one has two or
three<00:01:34.780> has<00:01:34.990> will<00:01:35.229> not<00:01:35.380> work<00:01:35.649> because<00:01:36.009> Maya

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
three has will not work because Maya

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.050 
three has will not work because Maya
Maya<00:01:37.899> does<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:38.649> recognize<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.429> file<00:01:39.700> format

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
Maya does not recognize that file format

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
Maya does not recognize that file format
and<00:01:40.649> create<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:42.119> create<00:01:43.119> your

actually the folder you are going to
save<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.009> sequence<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.659> then<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.080> going

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
save the sequence and then you are going

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.359 
save the sequence and then you are going

chibok sequence that you need to load on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.680 
chibok sequence that you need to load on
Maya<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> second<00:02:02.759> part<00:02:02.909> where<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.270> will<00:02:03.630> be

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
Maya on the second part where we will be

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.169 
Maya on the second part where we will be
doing<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:05.899> let<00:02:06.899> us<00:02:06.930> find<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.799> footage

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
doing this so let us find the footage

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.430 
doing this so let us find the footage
how<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.390> looks<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.459> in<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.550> case<00:02:12.440> our

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
how it looks like and in this case our

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
how it looks like and in this case our
footage<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.630> jpg<00:02:16.050> sequence<00:02:16.440> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
footage is like this so jpg sequence you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.830 
footage is like this so jpg sequence you
can<00:02:16.620> clearly<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.450> JPEG

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
can clearly see that it is a JPEG

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.570 
can clearly see that it is a JPEG
sequence<00:02:22.170> 02<00:02:23.959> further

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.009 

and<00:02:29.110> now<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.379> our<00:02:30.830> ruler<00:02:31.129> has<00:02:31.370> finished<00:02:32.019> we

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
and now that our ruler has finished we

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.949 
and now that our ruler has finished we
can<00:02:33.049> import<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.390> onto<00:02:35.390> Maya<00:02:35.689> and<00:02:37.480> our<00:02:38.480> sequence

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
can import it onto Maya and our sequence

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:49.920 
can import it onto Maya and our sequence
will<00:02:39.079> be<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.319> 0<00:02:39.709> 1<00:02:40.159> 2<00:02:40.519> 3<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:43.250> end<00:02:45.519> and
