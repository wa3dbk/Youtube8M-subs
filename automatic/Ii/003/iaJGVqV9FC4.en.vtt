doing<00:00:54.810> this<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.230> fly<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:56.060> can<00:00:57.060> tap<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.420> an

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
doing this on the fly I can tap on an

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.280 
doing this on the fly I can tap on an
object<00:00:59.930> your<00:01:00.930> brother<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:02.070> build<00:01:03.140> make<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
object your brother can do build make it

lasted or bouncy play so you see how

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.230 
lasted or bouncy play so you see how
that<00:01:09.720> bounces<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.550> this<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.060> be

that bounces in so all of this can be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.870 
that bounces in so all of this can be
generated<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> created<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.280> an<00:01:14.490> iPad
