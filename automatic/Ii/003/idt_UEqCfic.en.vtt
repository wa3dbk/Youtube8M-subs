00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
then you take the same exact piece

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.840 
then you take the same exact piece
doesn't<00:01:43.799> matter<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.280> different<00:01:44.640> color

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850

then<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.880> get<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:52.360> 1<00:01:52.870> by<00:01:53.050> 8<00:01:56.370> place<00:01:57.370> underneath<00:01:57.820> so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
then we get a 1 by 8 place underneath so

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.000 
then we get a 1 by 8 place underneath so
this<00:01:58.720> part<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.080> empty<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.630> piece

this part is empty and get this piece

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.360 
this part is empty and get this piece
instead<00:02:03.010> of<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.750> two<00:02:05.260> stories<00:02:05.560> are<00:02:06.040> two

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
instead of it's two stories are two

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.280 
instead of it's two stories are two
blocks<00:02:06.730> tall<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.360> other<00:02:07.450> one<00:02:07.630> was<00:02:07.780> 30<00:02:08.020> blocks

then we get this piece you place it
underneath<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.870> 1<00:02:20.380> by<00:02:20.560> 8<00:02:20.880> flat<00:02:22.710> syntheses

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
underneath it 1 by 8 flat syntheses

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.600 
underneath it 1 by 8 flat syntheses
place<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.290> already<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.430> the
