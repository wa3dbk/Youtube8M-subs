and I can actually take that cut out bit
from<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.560> there<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.100> go<00:02:33.250> I've<00:02:33.400> got<00:02:33.430> rid

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
from there and there you go I've got rid

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.210 
from there and there you go I've got rid
of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.110> off<00:02:35.110> cut<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.650> from<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.010> backing

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
of the off cut there from the backing

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220 
of the off cut there from the backing
packet<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:37.030> we've<00:02:37.180> got<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> decal<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:37.870> there

packet now we've got a decal on there

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.020 
packet now we've got a decal on there
that's<00:02:38.740> ready<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> slide<00:02:39.640> onto<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that's ready just to slide onto the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.320 
that's ready just to slide onto the
guitar<00:02:40.180> hit<00:02:40.960> stop<00:02:41.760> okay<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:42.820> we've<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
guitar hit stop okay so we've got the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.870 
guitar hit stop okay so we've got the
decal<00:02:43.780> now<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.380> nicely<00:02:44.920> slipping<00:02:45.460> off<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
decal now it's nicely slipping off the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.940 
decal now it's nicely slipping off the
backing<00:02:46.510> paper<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.200> ready<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.470> go<00:02:47.590> on

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
backing paper and it's ready to go on

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.040 
backing paper and it's ready to go on
what<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.760> might<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.240> actually<00:02:49.390> put<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.870> on

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
what we might do is actually put this on

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.080 
what we might do is actually put this on
here<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:51.010> running<00:02:51.160> parallel<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
here so it's running parallel for the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.240 
here so it's running parallel for the
neck<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.530> up<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.860> where<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.100> want

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
neck and it's up to you where you want

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.170 
neck and it's up to you where you want
to<00:02:54.310> put<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:55.710> actual<00:02:56.710> logo<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.550> some<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.000> have

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
to put the actual logo but some you have

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.490 
to put the actual logo but some you have
to<00:02:58.210> play<00:02:58.360> around<00:02:58.570> with<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.990> try<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.440> a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
to play around with it and try it in a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.930 
to play around with it and try it in a
few<00:02:59.680> different<00:02:59.950> areas<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.610> which<00:03:00.760> one

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
few different areas and see which one

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.060 
few different areas and see which one
works<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.420> think<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.140> here<00:03:02.320> parallel<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
works I think just here parallel for the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.860 
works I think just here parallel for the
neck<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:03.610> probably<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> little<00:03:04.000> pissed<00:03:04.270> so

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
neck it's probably a little pissed so

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.910 
neck it's probably a little pissed so
really<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.380> need<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:05.800> slide<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.100> off<00:03:06.340> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
really you just need to slide it off and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.670 
really you just need to slide it off and
slide<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.430> backing<00:03:09.700> paper<00:03:09.820> out<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.680> because

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
slide the backing paper out and because

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.950 
slide the backing paper out and because
it<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:11.920> still<00:03:12.220> wet<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.270> move<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.630> around<00:03:13.690> a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
it is still wet you can move it around a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.940 
it is still wet you can move it around a
little<00:03:14.050> bit<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.440> actually<00:03:14.770> looks

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
little bit but that actually looks

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
little bit but that actually looks
pretty<00:03:15.010> good<00:03:15.450> some<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:17.580> damp<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> down

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
pretty good some I just damp it down

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.550 
pretty good some I just damp it down
there<00:03:19.210> get<00:03:19.480> rid<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.720> any<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.230> air<00:03:20.770> bubbles<00:03:22.560> okay

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
there get rid of any it air bubbles okay

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.650 
there get rid of any it air bubbles okay
