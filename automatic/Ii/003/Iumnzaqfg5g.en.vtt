00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.920
 or the attitude today is in the tutorial of 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.840
 how to make a server with volts the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.640
 version 12.5 of minecraft 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
 The first thing we have to do is a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.230
 backup of our folder 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.230
 maika point for that let's go to data 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.150
 and here we have our point folder 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.470
 micro 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.470
 so we make a copy 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.780
 what are we going 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.570
 and more than anything to make a copy of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 security because the server mods 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.040
 may result 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.250
 that does not agree with the others and I know that 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 an error in minecraft 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 so let's hope that this is 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.980
 copy and the egg is worth once copied 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.720
 produces a man 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.590
 more than anything for the copy of his life 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.590
 that does not matter 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 now we take our point minecraft 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 the two links will let those of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.860
 server and the minecraft point in the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.130
 description 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.750
 first that minecraft point is downloaded 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.310
 and this is the one that is 3 that install all 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.680
 those who want to enter the server 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.060
 Well you have to install this this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.470
 binder 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.470
 now we go back to the data 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.940
 we can save we have a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940
 backup 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.290
 and now we copy the files 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.630
 of this 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.930
 we click right extract in point 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.930
 Minecraft 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 there are not many ways now I will teach you 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.560
 some of us have here on the list in this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.560
 in this rap 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.630
 with hours 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.310
 it's worth nothing we cut 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.080
 so you 're copying but better 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.950
 cut it if we have it only in one place 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.630
 that we have it here 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.530
 a data 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.530
 once we have everything 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.700
 the person who wants to create the server 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840
 if you have to download the rar file the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.600
 second link that leaves you the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.630
 description that is this 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.230
 I extracted it in a folder that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230
 call server 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.970
 kind if you put it like that I'm going to extract the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.980
 server will be something like this 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.930
 and well here we have several files 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.420
 many files this serves to 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.090
 modify what the ip is if they appear 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.730
 our or not normal 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.790

 craft 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.450
 the solar plates 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.530
 the iron trunks do not have a haiti 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.730

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.730
 at the same I fall from kraft the power network 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.209

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.890
 configured at that point prophetess what 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.560
 The only thing you have to do is start the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.540
 server and which the other will connect and 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.440
