this<00:00:41.219> main<00:00:41.399> port<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> port<00:00:42.420> we're<00:00:42.660> going

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
this main port is the port we're going

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.850 
this main port is the port we're going
to<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.930> using<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> plug<00:00:43.410> our<00:00:43.559> wiring<00:00:43.590> harness

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to be using the plug our wiring harness

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
to be using the plug our wiring harness
into<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.149> ahead<00:00:45.210> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
into so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270 
into so I'm just gonna go ahead and
separate<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:45.809> pieces<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> tab<00:00:47.100> up

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
separate the two pieces there's a tab up

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
separate the two pieces there's a tab up
top<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> press<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
top you just want to press that in and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
top you just want to press that in and
pull<00:00:49.590> away<00:00:49.739> from<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> taillight<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
pull away from the taillight and that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
pull away from the taillight and that
separates<00:00:52.350> them<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> driver's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
separates them over here on the driver's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.189 
separates them over here on the driver's
side<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> plug<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.690> our<00:00:54.840> ports

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
side we're going to plug in our ports

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
side we're going to plug in our ports
that<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.770> yellow<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> brown<00:00:56.399> wires<00:00:56.699> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that have the yellow and brown wires in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
that have the yellow and brown wires in
them<00:00:57.289> we're<00:00:58.289> basically<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> plug

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
them we're basically just going to plug

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
them we're basically just going to plug
in<00:00:59.190> line<00:00:59.399> from<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> disconnect<00:01:01.020> point<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
connector obviously we got to get that

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.999 
connector obviously we got to get that
all<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.840> way<00:01:53.990> across<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.679> get<00:01:54.800> up<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
all the way across and get up to the

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.889 
all the way across and get up to the
tail<00:01:55.220> light<00:01:55.429> so<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:56.330> we're<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.570> do<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
tail light so what we're going to do is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.300 
tail light so what we're going to do is
to<00:01:57.050> take<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> fasteners<00:01:57.740> off<00:01:57.890> at<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.100> fascia

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
to take the fasteners off at the fascia

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.149 
to take the fasteners off at the fascia
bottoms<00:01:59.179> here<00:01:59.330> all<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.110> way<00:02:00.200> across<00:02:00.380> well

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
bottoms here all the way across well

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.620 
bottoms here all the way across well
pull<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.429> back<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> little<00:02:01.880> bit<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.509> we'll

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
pull that back a little bit and we'll

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.510 
pull that back a little bit and we'll
feed<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.869> wires<00:02:03.050> behind<00:02:03.229> there

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.400 

but<00:02:10.120> now<00:02:10.270> they're<00:02:10.420> underneath<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.930> pest<00:02:11.230> your

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
but now they're underneath the pest your

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.510 
but now they're underneath the pest your
side<00:02:11.590> taillight<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.220> need<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> go<00:02:12.460> ahead

side taillight we just need to go ahead

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.490 
side taillight we just need to go ahead
and<00:02:12.670> feed<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> connector<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:14.380> our

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and feed the connector up and make our

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.310 
and feed the connector up and make our
connection<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> taillight<00:02:15.640> assembly
