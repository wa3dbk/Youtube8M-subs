full<00:01:26.020> off<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.860> food<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.759> my<00:01:27.820> opinion<00:01:27.939> whoo

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
full off of the food in my opinion whoo

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.870

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
it wasn't really the most outstanding

it wasn't really the most outstanding
thing<00:01:31.329> in<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.479> world<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.720> didn't<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:32.140> blow<00:01:32.409> my

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
thing in the world I didn't like blow my

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.700 
thing in the world I didn't like blow my
mind<00:01:32.829> I<00:01:33.340> thought<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.000> was<00:01:34.119> probably<00:01:34.710> although

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
mind I thought it was probably although

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.550 
mind I thought it was probably although
exquisitely<00:01:36.700> average<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.689> for<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.140> price<00:01:38.350> it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
exquisitely average and for the price it

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.169 
exquisitely average and for the price it
probably<00:01:38.950> could<00:01:39.159> have<00:01:39.250> just<00:01:39.490> took<00:01:39.700> an<00:01:39.880> extra

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
probably could have just took an extra

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.529 
probably could have just took an extra
person<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:41.380> Golden<00:01:41.799> Corral<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.270> don't<00:01:43.390> know

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
person to Golden Corral and I don't know

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.059 
person to Golden Corral and I don't know
at<00:01:44.049> least<00:01:44.140> they<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> soft-serve<00:01:45.009> machine

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
at least they have a soft-serve machine

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:51.929 
at least they have a soft-serve machine
I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.920> you've<00:01:51.039> been<00:01:51.069> influenced<00:01:51.880> by

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
I think that you've been influenced by

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
just as a reminder as if you needed it

this<00:02:19.269> frame<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.690> here<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.829> have<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.280> second

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
this frame is here and we have a second

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.720 
this frame is here and we have a second
frame<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.780> right<00:02:23.109> here<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:24.700> I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
frame that is right here now I

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.580 
frame that is right here now I
considered<00:02:25.450> putting<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:25.810> here<00:02:26.019> but<00:02:26.200> that's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
considered putting one here but that's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.960 
considered putting one here but that's
just<00:02:26.769> not<00:02:27.010> going<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.220> work<00:02:27.370> because<00:02:27.579> we're<00:02:27.910> in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
just not going to work because we're in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.309 
just not going to work because we're in
the<00:02:28.060> kitchen<00:02:28.329> too<00:02:28.450> much<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:28.840> could<00:02:28.989> bump<00:02:29.170> it

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
the kitchen too much we could bump it

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.410 
the kitchen too much we could bump it
and<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.530> could<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.709> bad<00:02:29.859> so<00:02:30.250> I'm<00:02:30.579> thinking

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
and that could be bad so I'm thinking

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.390 
and that could be bad so I'm thinking
since<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.900> wall<00:02:32.139> was<00:02:32.290> pretty<00:02:32.590> much<00:02:32.739> taken<00:02:33.250> up

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
since this wall was pretty much taken up

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340 
since this wall was pretty much taken up
that<00:02:34.120> we're<00:02:34.359> probably<00:02:34.569> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.959> put<00:02:35.170> it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
that we're probably going to put it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.009 
that we're probably going to put it
probably<00:02:36.190> maybe<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.180> will<00:02:37.780> call<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
probably maybe here I will call that

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.750 
probably maybe here I will call that
spot<00:02:38.410> one<00:02:39.540> perhaps<00:02:40.540> somewhere<00:02:41.579> over<00:02:42.579> there

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
spot one perhaps somewhere over there

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.870 
spot one perhaps somewhere over there
spot<00:02:43.569> two<00:02:44.100> somewhere<00:02:45.100> over<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.489> television

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
spot two somewhere over the television

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.349 
spot two somewhere over the television
spot<00:02:46.660> three<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.670> down<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.880> hallway<00:02:49.090> from<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
spot three and down the hallway from the

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.420 
spot three and down the hallway from the
kitchen<00:02:49.840> there's<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.470> little<00:02:50.739> room<00:02:50.889> right<00:02:50.950> here

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
kitchen there's a little room right here

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.690 
kitchen there's a little room right here
so<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:51.910> gonna<00:02:52.030> call<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.380> spot<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.459> just

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
so I'm gonna call that spot for and just

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.949 
so I'm gonna call that spot for and just
to<00:02:54.819> run<00:02:55.030> through<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.420> one<00:02:55.540> more<00:02:55.660> time<00:02:55.810> in

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
to run through that one more time in

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.030 
to run through that one more time in
case<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.139> didn't<00:02:56.349> get<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.560> coming<00:02:56.859> through

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
this hallway spa for in factors that

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.699 
this hallway spa for in factors that
you're<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.230> want<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.560> about

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you're going to want to think about

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.699 
you're going to want to think about
include<00:03:12.280> where<00:03:13.269> we<00:03:13.510> evolved<00:03:14.019> normally<00:03:14.470> you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
include where we evolved normally you

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.800 
include where we evolved normally you
know<00:03:14.829> when<00:03:15.010> we're<00:03:15.160> filming<00:03:15.549> so<00:03:16.389> you<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.750> it

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
know when we're filming so you want it

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.420 
know when we're filming so you want it
to<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:17.019> shown<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.410> background<00:03:17.590> Lamont<00:03:18.220> and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
to be shown in the background Lamont and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.800 
to be shown in the background Lamont and
then<00:03:18.639> people's<00:03:19.000> cards<00:03:19.299> will<00:03:19.389> be<00:03:19.480> displayed

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
then people's cards will be displayed

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.809 
then people's cards will be displayed
more<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:20.920> about<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.400> about

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
more so think about that think about

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.699 
more so think about that think about
where<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.060> should<00:03:22.209> put<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.480> and

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
where we should put it and

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.679 
where we should put it and
just<00:03:24.099> give<00:03:24.640> me<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.819> number<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.390> your

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
just give me a number and your

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.599 
just give me a number and your
corresponding<00:03:26.290> numbers<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.829> don't<00:03:27.340> know<00:03:27.459> where

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
corresponding numbers I don't know where

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.910 
corresponding numbers I don't know where
to<00:03:27.700> put<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.849> up<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.629> I<00:03:29.019> will<00:03:29.230> tell<00:03:29.469> you<00:03:29.560> those<00:03:29.680> up

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
to put it up so I will tell you those up

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.059 
to put it up so I will tell you those up
in<00:03:30.579> probably<00:03:30.909> in<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.989> next<00:03:32.170> day<00:03:32.439> or<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
in probably in the next day or so and

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.130 
in probably in the next day or so and
that's<00:03:33.489> where<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> frame<00:03:33.969> will<00:03:34.090> go<00:03:34.209> if<00:03:34.959> you

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
that's where the frame will go if you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.740 
that's where the frame will go if you
want<00:03:35.319> my<00:03:35.500> personal<00:03:35.980> boat<00:03:36.400> I'm<00:03:36.609> thinking<00:03:37.209> for
