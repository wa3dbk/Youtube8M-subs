SCEP<00:00:54.920> T<00:00:55.920> or<00:00:56.160> e<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.059> sure<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
SCEP T or e I'm not sure I just

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.609 
SCEP T or e I'm not sure I just
pronounce<00:00:58.289> that<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:02.420> they<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:05.090> apparently

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
pronounce that but they have apparently

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.289

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

I'm guessing that's from a Wii
controller<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> better<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.549> all

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
the cracks

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.710 
the cracks
they<00:01:27.090> didn't<00:01:28.640> I've<00:01:29.640> never<00:01:29.880> seen<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> dent<00:01:30.509> like

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
they didn't I've never seen a dent like

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
they didn't I've never seen a dent like
that<00:01:30.990> before<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.920> spider<00:01:32.400> cracks

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

all over the place up here it's cracked
clear<00:01:37.799> over<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:42.259> you're<00:01:43.259> probably

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
clear over here so you're probably

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
clear over here so you're probably
thinking<00:01:43.729> well<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:44.909> great<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
thinking well that's great it kind of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.440 
thinking well that's great it kind of
broken<00:01:45.810> TV<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:47.009> can't<00:01:47.280> fix<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.329> you're

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
broken TV you can't fix that and you're

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.560 
broken TV you can't fix that and you're
right<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> can't

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
right I can't

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
right I can't
that<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.750> take<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> sell<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.530> boards

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that can take and sell these boards

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.139 
that can take and sell these boards
maybe<00:01:55.880> probably<00:01:56.880> make<00:01:57.149> $200<00:01:57.930> off<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
maybe probably make $200 off of it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.929 
maybe probably make $200 off of it
because<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> can't<00:02:00.450> find<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.930> TV<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.439> eBay<00:02:01.939> and

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
broken thing or if it's because it has

broken thing or if it's because it has
this<00:02:29.610> thing<00:02:29.670> here's<00:02:30.299> scrolling<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.319> back

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this thing here's scrolling on it back

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.300 
this thing here's scrolling on it back
and<00:02:31.709> forth

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and forth

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.020 
and forth
you<00:02:32.909> got<00:02:33.060> some<00:02:33.269> damage<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.840> these<00:02:34.019> lines

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
you got some damage with these lines

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.250 
you got some damage with these lines
like<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.060> said<00:02:36.360> I'm<00:02:36.540> not<00:02:36.659> sure<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:37.049> that's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
like I said I'm not sure if that's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.099 
like I said I'm not sure if that's
because<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.650> his<00:02:37.739> TV<00:02:38.010> with<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.519> board

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
because of his TV with the board

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.589 
because of his TV with the board
hopefully<00:02:40.109> it's<00:02:40.439> just<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.739> getting<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:41.069> TV

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
hopefully it's just for getting the TV

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.819 
hopefully it's just for getting the TV
then<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.659> could<00:02:42.810> take<00:02:42.959> content<00:02:43.319> around<00:02:43.620> throw

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
then I could take content around throw

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:56.720 
then I could take content around throw
the<00:02:43.980> boards<00:02:47.930> that's<00:02:48.930> pretty<00:02:49.319> cool<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.579> get

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the boards that's pretty cool so you get

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
the boards that's pretty cool so you get
a<00:02:56.760> broken<00:02:57.090> TV<00:02:57.299> turn<00:02:58.109> around<00:02:58.379> sell<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> parts
