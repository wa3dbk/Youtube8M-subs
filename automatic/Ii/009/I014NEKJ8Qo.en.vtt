know what i think it's it's knowing each
other<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.930> again<00:00:43.320> our<00:00:43.620> airplane<00:00:44.550> neutral

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
other I think again our airplane neutral

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
other I think again our airplane neutral
zone<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.510> way<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.079> give<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.530> too

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
zone the way that we don't give up too

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
zone the way that we don't give up too
many<00:00:47.129> odd<00:00:47.370> man<00:00:47.550> rushes<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
many odd man rushes and all that it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.650 
many odd man rushes and all that it
really<00:00:49.020> helps<00:00:49.969> like<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> said<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.420> for

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
really helps like I said you know for

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
really helps like I said you know for
for<00:00:51.809> goalie<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.289> defense<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.949> know

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
for goalie and defense when you know

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.979 
for goalie and defense when you know
where<00:00:53.699> your<00:00:53.820> break<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.449> we'll<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.809> all

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
where your break down so we'll be at all

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.700 
where your break down so we'll be at all
time<00:00:55.199> makes<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> easier<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> react<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.360> them

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
time makes it easier to react to to them

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
time makes it easier to react to to them
