00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
time delay although I have said a minute

went<00:02:42.360> by<00:02:42.600> where<00:02:42.930> they<00:02:43.020> could<00:02:43.200> have<00:02:43.290> made<00:02:43.470> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
went by where they could have made that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.670 
went by where they could have made that
decision<00:02:43.740> perhaps<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.520> bit<00:02:44.610> earlier

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680

fortunately<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.770> looks<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.070> me<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.400> no<00:02:47.610> one

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
fortunately it looks to me as if no one

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 
fortunately it looks to me as if no one
was<00:02:47.940> hurt<00:02:48.090> what<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> problem<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
was hurt what is a problem here of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
was hurt what is a problem here of
course<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.770> he'll<00:02:49.920> damaged<00:02:50.400> some<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.910> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
goes out this is sort of 90% slippery

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.690 
goes out this is sort of 90% slippery
this<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.690> 50%<00:04:10.019> slippery<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.519> know<00:04:11.670> that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
this is 50% slippery they just know that

obviously they get to it's slippery old

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.490 
obviously they get to it's slippery old
