00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.480
 good these moments still did not live good 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.670
 It is an example of background killzone 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.490
 Saturday folk had already had the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 playstation 4 and good first of all 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.790
 say what 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.660
 playstation playstation network of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.920
 maintenance in crisis are 4 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 basically, I can not start 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 session or anything so I bring a little 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 video of the campaign mode here are my 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859
 good I wanted to upload the multiplayer 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 but it seems that it can not be today 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 can i can not connect is one of the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 problems that I have is that you have almost 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.650
 everything we had initiation 4 today 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 you can connect us to the network ni na ni 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.190
 expect no game or anything for the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
 style thing you 're fucking me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 quite but it is normal to have sold 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.460
 a lot of units here in europe and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 all try to start at the same time 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.059
 and that is what happens, not the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.430
 I 'm a bit angry 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.530
 as well 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.730
 but good you will have to endure some 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.710
 how many hours do we have to be 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
 a lot of tomorrow already works because if not already 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.020
 they are being falsified as it starts to 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.750
 cost money this from playing online and such 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.010
 Well, really get mad, let's hope 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 that is solved as I say soon 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.910
 but always do not do it either 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.830
 case we are not playing either very well 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.240
 the truth is here with several people 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 and they were not concentrating on anything 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.780
 I was more aware of what they were doing 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840
 the others that what I did playing 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.950
 here is a moment that I even stay 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.260
 stopped and I do not know what I have to do 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.479
 He started shooting a ship and it's not going 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.040
 so miracles I have to say too 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.050
 I have another problem I can not 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.690
 capture with the captor what 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.270
 you are watching is a gameplay of the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.540
 capturing but I recorded with the franz 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.720
 which is a program to record videos in 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.520
 the order I started with which the program 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 of the grabber I put it a big and 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.730
 He recorded it with the bottle, which 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.920
 good the final quality will not be the same 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.300
 of good that when I recorded normal of 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.310
 the renders settings 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.930
 also it does not expose them yet well 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.870
 you see how it looks hopefully 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.510
 surely it will be someone not knowing how 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.340
 knowing wrong is clearly and logically never 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.320
 will have the final quality that you can 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.330
 hope you have on play 4 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.670
 basically because youtube is eaten 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.970
 front per second goes to 30 as much and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.360
 this for 60 in it with which then it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.070
 note quite then the difference is not 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.200
 and it's a problem that I have already 6 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.520
 because you can not record only you do not 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.170
 can only capture in play four 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.210
 with the grabber in this zone splitter 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.570
 and such I have bought one but justly 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.790
 it is a model that did not work and the 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.710
 next it will come to me or on the 5th the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.090
 day 12 of the next month with which 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.090
 good will take a lot and I'll 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.280
 replace engrave will be like this I hope that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 the quality bothers us a lot and good 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.209
 Well, I can bring when I have all the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.470
 capture of such it will improve a little 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.080
 it's good that I was doing tests and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.550
 neither does it look like it does not look like 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.550
 Cocks looks good 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.780
 because more then that is not going to 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.430
 present a lot of people was 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.140
 asking if there are four only 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.940
 I'm saying that surely if 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.160
 they have functions but between four as 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.560
 I say why 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.930
 does not work will not have to wait 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.040
 because I also wanted to go up 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.990
 some multi-game pill 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 battlefield 4 also in the some 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.880
 multiplayer game of killzone also 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.800
 I wanted to make the first dish of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.390
 play 4 that soon you will see when you can 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.380
 connect me then they will give me a platinum 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 I want you to see it too 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.730
 It makes it much easier to see 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.730
 I was pretty good 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.490
 the empanada the empanada as 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.620
 we wanted 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.640
 for now it's the upl and 4 so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.470
 I could prove that it was the killzone 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.780
 well, well 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.880
 a shooter like any other which 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.380
 I expected it was more multiplayer than the 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.230
 campaign because the campaign of 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.850
 shooters lately because few things 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.410
 Well wait, I mean it in a few 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.240
 things then wait because we do not do 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.610
 very well the things we say could 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.390
 put a lot more innovation but good at 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.390
 this title 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.659
 I liked the fish mercenary more 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.430
 avoid how history was and things and 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.230
 so although we also have the egg this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.180
 is a milestone robot that we can launch and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.620
 do different things but hey I do not 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.299
 finish convincing as I say I prefer 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.250
 play multiplayer 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.900
 from this title I mean because there 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.530
 other games that I prefer a thousand times more 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.000
 the bell 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:22.480
 in which more games that you are going to see in the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.730
 channel lately as they give away 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.940
 also the contrast between your seeing something 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.550
 also alfonso the multiplayer also 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.980
 I suppose part fill 4 multiplayer 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.920
 I also suppose call of duty ghost 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.170
 multiplayer of play 4 and I do not know any 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.730
 title languages ​​that come out at 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.980
 I better buy a and for speed I do not know 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.630
 You'll see to see what I get 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.180
 I'm going to float everything, you can exploit everything 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 what I have for now that is pretty and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.190
 I will be able to play everything calmly 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.870
 so well I do not know what else to say for 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.700
 some optional of this video from 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.290
 neutrophils for the trophies come out 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.190
 different birds as they come out and such 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.470
 graphically as I say it looks pretty 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.000
 better the game than in any video 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.960
 that you can see on YouTube because 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.270
 I mean very seriously it would look pretty 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.950
 rather better is very very amazing 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.470
 to do to make a title of 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.660
 launch of a new console and or 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.820
 true 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.050
 type many and this surprises the games 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.970
 I do not want to imagine how it is going to 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.760
 losing a cancer charter is the 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.320
 print and fernando to shit 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.370
 we're going to stay all over we're going to 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.320
 say what is happening 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.669
 It will be a piece of our past 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.290
 as for the people that we are other 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.780
 numbers only play on consoles and not 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.900
 we are used to playing on pc and 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.610
 such 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.290
 so good for now if there are 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.090
 things I have problems everywhere 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.630
 problems to win and for everything and good 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.990
 I hope this digital thing next 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.990
 video
