00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
ah maybe we could also sometimes see the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.820 
ah maybe we could also sometimes see the
master<00:02:57.750> game<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:58.110> there's<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> monster

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
master game actually there's a monster

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.590 
master game actually there's a monster
game<00:02:59.040> reference<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.550> some<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.850> them<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.210> um

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
game reference on some of them so um

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.790 
game reference on some of them so um
let's<00:03:03.600> see<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.050> black<00:03:04.350> play<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
let's see so black play the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.480 
let's see so black play the
vulnerabilities<00:03:05.490> okay<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.240> bishop<00:03:07.490> or

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
vulnerabilities okay that bishop or

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.040 
vulnerabilities okay that bishop or
actually<00:03:09.000> work<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> has<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.840> taken

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
actually work on that has to be taken

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.980 
actually work on that has to be taken
will<00:03:10.320> just<00:03:10.470> be<00:03:10.560> equal<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:10.980> material<00:03:11.460> right

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.440 

the<00:03:15.990> forcing<00:03:16.500> moves<00:03:16.710> up<00:03:16.950> sort<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.820> shines<00:03:18.210> me

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the forcing moves up sort of shines me

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.440 
the forcing moves up sort of shines me
some<00:03:18.960> weaknesses<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.590> well<00:03:19.850> just<00:03:20.850> discovering

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
some weaknesses as well just discovering

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.820 
some weaknesses as well just discovering
some<00:03:21.690> witnesses<00:03:22.080> while<00:03:22.230> looking<00:03:22.470> at<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.590> full

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
some witnesses while looking at the full

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.750 
some witnesses while looking at the full
seems<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.970> even<00:03:24.270> ridiculous<00:03:24.900> ones<00:03:25.760> but

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
seems like the even ridiculous ones but

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920 
seems like the even ridiculous ones but
um<00:03:27.030> yeah<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> intuitive<00:03:28.280> assessment<00:03:29.280> here

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
um yeah the intuitive assessment here

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.360 
um yeah the intuitive assessment here
there's<00:03:30.930> only<00:03:30.990> two<00:03:31.290> routes<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> bit<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.220> a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
there's only two routes is a bit of a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.770 
there's only two routes is a bit of a
back<00:03:32.580> row<00:03:32.820> potential<00:03:33.390> weakness<00:03:33.980> um<00:03:35.330> night<00:03:36.330> f1

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
back row potential weakness um night f1

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.350 
back row potential weakness um night f1
hits<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.230> Queen<00:03:37.440> Brooke<00:03:37.680> tanks<00:03:44.360> there's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
hits the Queen Brooke tanks there's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.980 
hits the Queen Brooke tanks there's
Queen<00:03:45.720> tanks<00:03:46.170> 91<00:03:46.950> rugby<00:03:47.400> one<00:03:48.560> yeah<00:03:49.560> Knight<00:03:49.950> g4

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
Queen tanks 91 rugby one yeah Knight g4

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.840 
Queen tanks 91 rugby one yeah Knight g4
that's<00:03:51.990> not<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.290> only<00:03:52.320> thing<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.070> hits<00:03:53.310> II<00:03:53.490> one

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
that's not the only thing it hits II one

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.810 
that's not the only thing it hits II one
with<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.209> check<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.860> but<00:03:56.489> we're<00:03:56.610> still

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
with this check of that but we're still

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.690 
with this check of that but we're still
on<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.180> row<00:04:00.950> when<00:04:01.950> they're<00:04:02.130> taking<00:04:02.550> that

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
on the back row when they're taking that

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.530 
on the back row when they're taking that
check<00:04:03.650> no<00:04:04.650> not<00:04:05.130> knocking<00:04:05.580> Vince<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.300> follow

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
check no not knocking Vince so follow

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.430 
check no not knocking Vince so follow
anything

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.830 

see<00:04:15.860> let's<00:04:16.860> go<00:04:17.010> back<00:04:17.220> again<00:04:17.840> weaknesses

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
see let's go back again weaknesses

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.330 
see let's go back again weaknesses
intuitively<00:04:19.500> that's<00:04:19.830> trying<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> put

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
intuitively that's trying to put

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.949 
intuitively that's trying to put
Witnesses<00:04:20.489> intuitively<00:04:21.360> and<00:04:21.630> whites

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
Witnesses intuitively and whites

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.840 
Witnesses intuitively and whites
position<00:04:22.380> e<00:04:22.530> 1<00:04:23.460> seems<00:04:23.910> intuitively<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:25.760> bit<00:04:26.760> of

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
position e 1 seems intuitively a bit of

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.910 
position e 1 seems intuitively a bit of
a<00:04:26.910> weakness<00:04:27.120> in<00:04:27.420> fact<00:04:27.840> there's<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.320> back<00:04:28.500> row<00:04:28.740> is

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
a weakness in fact there's a back row is

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.070 
a weakness in fact there's a back row is
there<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> better<00:04:29.580> although<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.720> this

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
there is a better although it's this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.940 
there is a better although it's this
awkward<00:04:31.500> configuration<00:04:32.160> here<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> night<00:04:32.730> is

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
awkward configuration here the night is

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
awkward configuration here the night is
obstructing<00:04:34.950> he<00:04:35.160> one<00:04:35.400> that's<00:04:35.610> also<00:04:35.940> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
obstructing he one that's also a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.390 
obstructing he one that's also a
potential<00:04:36.240> back<00:04:36.570> row<00:04:36.780> mate<00:04:37.020> I'm<00:04:37.710> wondering

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
potential back row mate I'm wondering

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.340 
potential back row mate I'm wondering
now<00:04:38.640> about<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.240> forcing<00:04:39.750> move<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.110> light<00:04:40.320> of

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
now about this forcing move in light of

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.310 
now about this forcing move in light of
the<00:04:40.560> back<00:04:40.710> row<00:04:41.330> answering<00:04:42.330> night<00:04:42.510> takes<00:04:42.750> f<00:04:42.960> 5

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the back row answering night takes f 5

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.220 
the back row answering night takes f 5
which<00:04:44.250> hits<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> Queen<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:44.970> hit<00:04:45.060> Z<00:04:45.270> 1<00:04:45.480> so

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
which hits the Queen and hit Z 1 so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.770 
which hits the Queen and hit Z 1 so
Queen<00:04:46.590> takes<00:04:46.830> rook<00:04:47.490> takes<00:04:47.760> Knight<00:04:48.390> takes<00:04:48.690> f5

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
Queen takes rook takes Knight takes f5

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.060 
Queen takes rook takes Knight takes f5
if<00:04:51.780> we<00:04:51.900> take<00:04:52.080> hair<00:04:52.350> takes<00:04:52.590> we're<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:52.950> an

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
if we take hair takes we're in an

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.590 
if we take hair takes we're in an
embarrassing<00:04:53.280> situation<00:04:53.700> with<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.270> Queen

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
embarrassing situation with the Queen

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.810 
embarrassing situation with the Queen
head<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.220> rook<00:04:56.220> e1<00:04:56.370> threatened<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:58.820> think

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
head and rook e1 threatened I think

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.370 
head and rook e1 threatened I think
that's<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.210> actually<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:00.990> they'll<00:05:01.290> be

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
that's it actually I think they'll be

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.380 
that's it actually I think they'll be
the<00:05:01.590> idea<00:05:05.210> yep<00:05:07.370> okay<00:05:08.370> that<00:05:08.670> was<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:08.970> rows<00:05:09.240> and

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
the idea yep okay that was in rows and

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.620 
the idea yep okay that was in rows and
Silas<00:05:09.840> against<00:05:10.260> Adams<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.430> Queen<00:05:11.850> takes<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.360> one

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
Silas against Adams so Queen takes a one

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.450 
Silas against Adams so Queen takes a one
so<00:05:13.200> if<00:05:13.290> we're<00:05:13.440> up<00:05:13.590> times<00:05:13.860> they<00:05:14.040> are<00:05:14.070> night

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
so if we're up times they are night

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.250 
so if we're up times they are night
takes<00:05:14.730> fi<00:05:15.150> we're<00:05:15.330> hitting<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.690> Queen<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.140> II

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
takes fi we're hitting the Queen and II

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.830 
takes fi we're hitting the Queen and II
one<00:05:16.590> it's<00:05:16.800> awkward<00:05:17.100> back<00:05:17.340> row<00:05:17.750> even<00:05:18.750> though

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
one it's awkward back row even though

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.360 
one it's awkward back row even though
the<00:05:18.930> back<00:05:19.110> roads<00:05:19.380> seem<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.590> be<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:20.070> covered

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the back roads seem to be in a covered

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.770 
the back roads seem to be in a covered
by<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.550> two<00:05:20.760> rocks<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.180> your<00:05:21.210> hair<00:05:21.510> hair

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
by the two rocks in your hair hair

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.830 
by the two rocks in your hair hair
threatens<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.680> mate<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.130> Queen<00:05:23.340> ok<00:05:23.880> cool

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.210 

yeah<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.870> think<00:05:28.080> sometimes<00:05:28.320> we<00:05:28.680> have<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.830> switch

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
yeah I think sometimes we have to switch

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.980 
yeah I think sometimes we have to switch
between<00:05:29.400> full<00:05:29.820> series<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.180> looking<00:05:30.810> again<00:05:30.930> at

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
between full series and looking again at

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.870 
between full series and looking again at
Winx<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.560> in<00:05:31.680> principle<00:05:32.300> now<00:05:33.300> here<00:05:33.480> again<00:05:33.630> and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
Winx is in principle now here again and

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.250 
Winx is in principle now here again and
I'm<00:05:35.880> not<00:05:36.060> sure<00:05:36.240> that's<00:05:36.390> such<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.690> background

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
I'm not sure that's such a background

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.940 
I'm not sure that's such a background
issue<00:05:37.440> Bart's<00:05:39.020> decider<00:05:40.020> of<00:05:40.140> night<00:05:40.380> f7<00:05:40.890> the

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
issue Bart's decider of night f7 the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.430 
issue Bart's decider of night f7 the
conjunction<00:05:41.430> with<00:05:41.460> this<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.050> think<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
conjunction with this and I think I

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.430 
conjunction with this and I think I
think<00:05:43.650> that's<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.980> yeah<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.610> looks<00:05:44.820> like<00:05:45.440> the

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
think that's it yeah it looks like the

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.890 
think that's it yeah it looks like the
four<00:05:46.680> seam<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:46.980> Queen<00:05:47.220> e5<00:05:47.550> Heather's<00:05:47.940> it's<00:05:48.690> set

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
four seam of Queen e5 Heather's it's set

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.630 
four seam of Queen e5 Heather's it's set
up<00:05:48.930> for<00:05:49.140> this<00:05:49.350> vulnerability<00:05:49.680> of<00:05:50.040> fault<00:05:50.400> the

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
up for this vulnerability of fault the

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.620 
up for this vulnerability of fault the
 they're<00:05:51.240> so<00:05:52.050> Queenie<00:05:52.440> five<00:05:53.060> takes<00:05:54.060> check

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
 they're so Queenie five takes check

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.910 
 they're so Queenie five takes check
there's<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.050> Kings<00:05:55.290> got<00:05:55.470> no<00:05:55.560> escape<00:05:55.890> there

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
there's the Kings got no escape there

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.510 
there's the Kings got no escape there
takes<00:05:56.550> takes<00:05:57.260> wind<00:05:58.260> up<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.500> night<00:05:58.770> up<00:05:58.980> on<00:05:59.250> queen

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
takes takes wind up a night up on queen

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.990 
takes takes wind up a night up on queen
e<00:05:59.700> five<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:00.300> is<00:06:00.420> that<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:00.630> strongest

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.590 

we're<00:06:05.930> heading<00:06:06.200> the<00:06:06.320> queen<00:06:06.590> is<00:06:06.620> no<00:06:06.830> Roxy<00:06:07.190> too

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
we're heading the queen is no Roxy too

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.830 
we're heading the queen is no Roxy too
so<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:10.490> takes<00:06:10.760> I<00:06:11.030> mean<00:06:11.240> there's<00:06:11.390> night<00:06:11.540> tanks

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
so it takes I mean there's night tanks

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.410 
so it takes I mean there's night tanks
have<00:06:11.960> some<00:06:12.140> of<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.260> major<00:06:12.440> thing<00:06:13.000> then<00:06:14.000> taking

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
have some of the major thing then taking

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.080 
have some of the major thing then taking
out<00:06:14.600> up<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:14.840> we're<00:06:14.930> just<00:06:15.050> material<00:06:15.590> up<00:06:15.680> after

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
out up and we're just material up after

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.540 
out up and we're just material up after
that<00:06:17.140> anything<00:06:18.140> stronger<00:06:18.590> Queenie<00:06:19.280> five

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
that anything stronger Queenie five

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.020 
that anything stronger Queenie five
looks<00:06:20.110> very<00:06:21.110> nice<00:06:21.260> and<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.980> f6<00:06:22.400> retain<00:06:22.850> its

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
looks very nice and the f6 retain its

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.090 
looks very nice and the f6 retain its
still<00:06:23.210> that<00:06:23.360> mating<00:06:23.570> that<00:06:23.900> I<00:06:24.080> think<00:06:24.950> with<00:06:25.040> the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
still that mating that I think with the

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.130 
still that mating that I think with the
Queen<00:06:25.310> night<00:06:25.550> takes<00:06:25.880> yeah<00:06:26.330> having<00:06:26.870> Queen

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
Queen night takes yeah having Queen

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.870 
Queen night takes yeah having Queen
takes<00:06:27.350> d5<00:06:27.950> I<00:06:29.770> think<00:06:30.770> sometimes<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.490> forcing

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
takes d5 I think sometimes the forcing

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.290 
takes d5 I think sometimes the forcing
moves<00:06:32.060> revealed<00:06:32.420> tactical<00:06:32.960> weaknesses<00:06:33.380> so

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
moves revealed tactical weaknesses so

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
moves revealed tactical weaknesses so
you<00:06:35.300> know<00:06:35.390> sometimes<00:06:35.810> you<00:06:35.930> can<00:06:36.050> intuitively

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
you know sometimes you can intuitively

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.960 
you know sometimes you can intuitively
silo<00:06:36.980> space<00:06:37.250> but<00:06:37.430> there's<00:06:37.550> no<00:06:37.640> there's<00:06:37.910> no

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
silo space but there's no there's no

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.880 
silo space but there's no there's no
clear<00:06:38.300> loose<00:06:38.510> piece<00:06:38.840> here<00:06:39.140> but<00:06:39.380> it<00:06:39.470> just<00:06:39.500> seems

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
clear loose piece here but it just seems

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.220 
clear loose piece here but it just seems
that<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.130> forcing<00:06:40.490> moves<00:06:40.640> imply<00:06:41.080> but<00:06:42.080> like

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
that the forcing moves imply but like

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.290 
that the forcing moves imply but like
light<00:06:42.500> takes<00:06:42.740> f7<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.280> there's<00:06:43.669> a<00:06:43.730> full<00:06:44.000> care

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
light takes f7 that there's a full care

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.110 
light takes f7 that there's a full care
opportunity<00:06:45.169> so<00:06:46.010> I<00:06:46.070> think<00:06:46.130> Queen<00:06:46.550> takes<00:06:46.730> if<00:06:47.000> I

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
opportunity so I think Queen takes if I

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.730 
opportunity so I think Queen takes if I
let's<00:06:47.330> look<00:06:47.390> at<00:06:47.510> this<00:06:47.570> again<00:06:50.169> saying<00:06:51.169> F<00:06:51.380> sex

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
let's look at this again saying F sex

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.380 
let's look at this again saying F sex
there<00:06:51.919> we<00:06:52.130> just<00:06:52.310> take<00:06:52.490> the<00:06:52.580> Queen<00:06:52.820> off<00:06:52.970> check

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
we got time takes check check which is

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.670 
we got time takes check check which is
the<00:06:59.840> night<00:07:00.020> up<00:07:00.640> and<00:07:01.640> Queen<00:07:01.940> takes<00:07:04.240> yep<00:07:05.530> so<00:07:06.530> that

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
was in them Tim and against my Commodore
