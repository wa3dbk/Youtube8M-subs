different<00:00:36.629> type<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> bike<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:38.340> had<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> hard

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
different type of bike and I had a hard

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
different type of bike and I had a hard
time<00:00:38.910> finding<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.480> YouTube<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.559> he<00:00:40.860> made<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
time finding you on YouTube so he made a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
time finding you on YouTube so he made a
suggestion<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.090> shoot<00:00:42.210> crap<00:00:42.450> shot

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
suggestion that we just shoot crap shot

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
suggestion that we just shoot crap shot
videos<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.290> every<00:00:43.680> single<00:00:44.010> different<00:00:44.400> model

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
videos for every single different model

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.860 
videos for every single different model
that<00:00:44.790> comes<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.150> here<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.450> it'd<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.690> more

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that comes in here and it'd be more

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.330 
that comes in here and it'd be more
accessible<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.470> YouTube<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.950> thought<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
accessible on YouTube I thought was a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.370 
accessible on YouTube I thought was a
good<00:00:47.430> idea<00:00:47.490> so<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.420> you've<00:00:48.840> watched<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.230> bunch

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
good idea so if you've watched a bunch

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.770 
good idea so if you've watched a bunch
of<00:00:49.530> these<00:00:50.060> crankshaft<00:00:51.060> rebuilding<00:00:51.480> videos

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of these crankshaft rebuilding videos

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.210 
of these crankshaft rebuilding videos
you<00:00:51.900> can<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.110> ahead<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.440> shut<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
you can go ahead and shut this off and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.650 
you can go ahead and shut this off and
save<00:00:53.370> yourself<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> bunch<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.060> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.600> are

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
save yourself a bunch of time if you are

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840 
save yourself a bunch of time if you are
I<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.780> didn't<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.350> how<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.130> rm250

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I just didn't see how we do it in rm250

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.340 
I just didn't see how we do it in rm250
and<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> haven't<00:00:57.540> seen<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:57.960> videos

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and you haven't seen one of these videos

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470 
and you haven't seen one of these videos
I'm<00:00:59.340> sure<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.610> might<00:00:59.790> pick<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> couple<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I'm sure you might pick up a couple of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
I'm sure you might pick up a couple of
pointers<00:01:00.810> but<00:01:01.050> we'll<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.649> started<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:02.070> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pointers but we'll get started on this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.990 
pointers but we'll get started on this
thing<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> problem<00:01:07.670> all<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:08.820> let's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
thing is the problem all right let's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
thing is the problem all right let's
clear<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> myth<00:01:09.630> before<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.079> even<00:01:10.200> get

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
clear up a myth before we even get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.399 
clear up a myth before we even get
started<00:01:10.700> see<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> dark<00:01:12.810> spot<00:01:13.110> here

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
started see this dark spot here

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.980 
started see this dark spot here
overheated<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.510> crank<00:01:15.780> being

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
overheated that's from this crank being

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
overheated that's from this crank being
assembled<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.620> factory<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.400> an

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
assembled at the factory or an

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
assembled at the factory or an
aftermarket<00:01:17.970> place<00:01:18.420> even<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.840> don't<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.110> heat

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
aftermarket place even we don't use heat

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.050 
aftermarket place even we don't use heat
but<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> mean<00:01:19.860> some<00:01:20.130> place<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> doing<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
but I mean some place is doing it it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.550 
but I mean some place is doing it it's
totally<00:01:21.360> acceptable<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
totally acceptable we just have all the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.690 
totally acceptable we just have all the
ways<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> doing<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> don't<00:01:23.310> need<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> use

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
ways of doing it we don't need to use

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
ways of doing it we don't need to use
heat<00:01:24.049> but<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.560> does<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.979> indicate<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
heat but this does not indicate that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580 
heat but this does not indicate that
these<00:01:26.760> webs<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.210> bad<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.690> was<00:01:27.900> done<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
these webs are bad this was done at the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
these webs are bad this was done at the
factory<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> what<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.580> do<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.000> heat

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
factory and what they do is they heat

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.289 
factory and what they do is they heat
this<00:01:30.600> web<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.430> push<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.790> other<00:01:32.970> pin

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this web up and then push the other pin

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
this web up and then push the other pin
on<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.510> crankshaft<00:01:33.990> into<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
on the crankshaft into it and it just

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.289 
on the crankshaft into it and it just
makes<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.340> easier<00:01:35.700> alignment<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
makes for easier alignment of the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940 
makes for easier alignment of the
crankshaft<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.530> something<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
crankshaft so if you see something like

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.289 
crankshaft so if you see something like
this<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> you've<00:01:38.369> probably<00:01:38.490> gone<00:01:38.760> on<00:01:39.090> any

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this and you've probably gone on any

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
this and you've probably gone on any
crank<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.260> your<00:01:40.350> hands<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
crank that you get in your hands that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
crank that you get in your hands that's
perfectly<00:01:41.820> fine<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.840> particular

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
perfectly fine this particular

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.590 
perfectly fine this particular
crankshaft<00:01:43.890> uses<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.400> luminance<00:01:45.180> tougher

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
crankshaft uses a luminance tougher

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.750 
crankshaft uses a luminance tougher
blocks<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.860> crank<00:01:47.070> gets<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> thin

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
blocks and the crank gets kind of thin

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.100 
blocks and the crank gets kind of thin
in<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:48.600> reason

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
in here for that reason

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
in here for that reason
a<00:01:49.290> lot<00:01:50.010> of<00:01:50.100> shops<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
a lot of shops do it like this and I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.499 
a lot of shops do it like this and I
guess<00:01:52.260> it's<00:01:52.439> fine<00:01:52.650> we<00:01:52.920> chose<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.909> what

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
guess it's fine we chose not to but what

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
guess it's fine we chose not to but what
they<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> they'll<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> separator<00:01:56.340> plate

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
they do is they'll put a separator plate

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
they do is they'll put a separator plate
in<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.270> drive<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.229> pin<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.729> these

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
in here drive on this pin and get these

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280 
in here drive on this pin and get these
webs<00:02:00.150> pulled<00:02:00.420> apart<00:02:00.689> we're<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.140> do

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
webs pulled apart we're not going to do

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
webs pulled apart we're not going to do
that<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> any<00:02:02.340> cranks

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that we don't do that to any cranks

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
that we don't do that to any cranks
anymore<00:02:03.150> we<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.720> we<00:02:03.930> find<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
anymore we just we find that there's a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.880 
anymore we just we find that there's a
lot<00:02:04.650> less<00:02:05.009> Distortion<00:02:05.970> if<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.360> cut<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
lot less Distortion if we cut it so we

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
lot less Distortion if we cut it so we
have<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> proprietary<00:02:08.399> machine<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.299> not<00:02:09.420> going

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
have a proprietary machine I'm not going

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
have a proprietary machine I'm not going
to<00:02:09.629> show<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.049> you<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.409> what<00:02:10.829> we<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.099> we

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to show it to you but what we do is we

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
to show it to you but what we do is we
hold<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.730> rod<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.540> we're<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.079> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
hold that rod and we're just going to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530 
hold that rod and we're just going to
we're<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.829> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> cut<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:14.849> here<00:02:14.909> right

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
we're just going to cut right here right

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.059 
we're just going to cut right here right
through<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.930> pin<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
through this pin and that's going to

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.430 
through this pin and that's going to
separate<00:02:17.400> our<00:02:17.579> webs<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.270> point<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:19.290> can

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
separate our webs at that point we can

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.979 
separate our webs at that point we can
support<00:02:19.830> inside<00:02:20.610> directly<00:02:21.330> around<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.780> pen

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
support inside directly around the pen

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.570 
support inside directly around the pen
drive<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> two<00:02:23.160> high

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
drive the two high

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.990 
drive the two high
sow<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.500> create<00:02:25.500> no<00:02:25.740> additional<00:02:26.490> distortion

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sow and create no additional distortion

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.670 
sow and create no additional distortion
in<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> crankshaft<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.050> feel<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> lot

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
in the crankshaft I just feel it's a lot

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.160 
in the crankshaft I just feel it's a lot
more<00:02:28.890> accurate<00:02:29.100> job<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.570> lot<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> other<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
more accurate job and a lot of other you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.690 
more accurate job and a lot of other you
know<00:02:31.200> top-line<00:02:31.770> builders<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.490> same

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
know top-line builders do it the same

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.970 
know top-line builders do it the same
way<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.290> first<00:02:34.500> step<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:34.860> that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
way so that's the first step get that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.390 
way so that's the first step get that
rod<00:02:35.190> cut<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.520> half

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
rod cut in half

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.320 
rod cut in half
okay<00:02:38.400> here's<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> looks<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.270> we

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
okay here's what it looks like when we

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.820 
okay here's what it looks like when we
get<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.570> out<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> machine<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.440> again<00:02:40.680> we

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
get it out of the machine and again we

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
get it out of the machine and again we
just<00:02:40.860> cut<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.490> pin<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.870> weren't

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
just cut the pin and if you weren't

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.840 
just cut the pin and if you weren't
following<00:02:43.500> or<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> didn't<00:02:44.100> understand<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
following or you didn't understand the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.240 
following or you didn't understand the
whole<00:02:45.210> reasoning<00:02:45.600> behind<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
whole reasoning behind this I'm going to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.450 
whole reasoning behind this I'm going to
be<00:02:47.340> able<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.580> support<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.620> crankshaft<00:02:50.010> web

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
be able to support the crankshaft web

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.570 
be able to support the crankshaft web
here<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:51.840> drive<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.290> pin<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:52.920> that

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
here and then drive the pin here that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.210 
here and then drive the pin here that
zero<00:02:54.300> chance<00:02:54.600> for<00:02:54.720> Distortion<00:02:55.350> my<00:02:56.040> other

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
zero chance for Distortion my other

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.030 
zero chance for Distortion my other
option<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> support<00:02:57.690> around<00:02:57.990> here<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.560> lot

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
option was to support around here a lot

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.950 
option was to support around here a lot
of<00:02:59.190> force<00:02:59.400> taking<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.850> crankshaft<00:03:00.180> apart<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
of force taking a crankshaft apart and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.840 
of force taking a crankshaft apart and
we<00:03:01.530> don't<00:03:01.709> want<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.860> risk<00:03:02.040> anything<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.730> is

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
we don't want to risk anything this is

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.190 
we don't want to risk anything this is
enough<00:03:03.120> stuff<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.690> yours<00:03:03.990> we're<00:03:04.080> going

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
enough stuff this is yours we're going

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800 
enough stuff this is yours we're going
to<00:03:04.260> take<00:03:04.380> good<00:03:04.560> care<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.630> rather<00:03:06.630> than

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
to take good care of it so rather than

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.650 
to take good care of it so rather than
support<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.320> here<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.070> completely<00:03:09.060> prefer<00:03:09.510> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
support out here I completely prefer to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.970 
support out here I completely prefer to
support<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.110> right<00:03:10.350> here<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:10.890> we're

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
support it right here and then we're

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.620 
support it right here and then we're
just<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.250> drive<00:03:11.430> both<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> these<00:03:11.970> pins

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
just going to drive both of these pins

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.880 
just going to drive both of these pins
out<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.290> 40-ton<00:03:13.850> hydroelectric<00:03:14.850> press<00:03:15.890> my
