00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 with an incredible evolution a battery 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.040
 flush the hose came showing that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.040
 the community its greatest strength 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.690
 the painting 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.320
 ayrton's fan 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.050
 the mother 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.250
 the little man in the hose explains me how 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.070
 do you have the genius of 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.239
 put a samba that grows so much in the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.879
 avenue 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.210
 the majority of the composers who 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.250
 did this fantastic work that today 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.760
 does not yield what we expect because the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.640
 Sound car helps on parade day with 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.030
 the whole aisle was there that 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.190
 they are much more than they grew up but 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 hose came to dispute the title 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 you can be sure of that and this community 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.009
 involved how do you enforce the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 What was beautiful happened here, people? 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.680
 It's very beautiful, a lot of work. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.960
 dedication but who deserves the congratulations 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.960
 are they without mayor 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 ae 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.870
 ae 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.460
 I'm in the wonderful spelling was this that 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.100
 counterbalanced that we are 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.680
 working exhaustively and lady 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.440
 every day here at dawn in that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.110
 warmth to please you all and 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.229
 especially to my beloved ones 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.960
 Magellanic sufferers, I love you, thank you. 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.640
 for everything you are here right now 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.680
 people are here every day and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.810
 exhaustively until dawn 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.930
 there it is accustomed serious that 34 hours 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.350
 Next morning morning wake up at 7am in 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.480
 brasÃ­lia 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.850
 the night is here again and so on 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.190
 our routine from Monday to Monday 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 understood to give the best to the hose 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.380
 the best of this community she deserves 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.370
 then the synchrony and the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.989
 perfection 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 in this wonderful choreography that you 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.250
 came presenting that it will be the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.239
 The same original will bring the sound I do not know 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.239
 we will see 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.410
 the beque 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.450
 he 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 the battery is this how many answers is 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.560
 this number of boxes that will bring 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.080
 even on the avenue are exactly those 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.959
 voices we'll take him rodrigo 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.819
 so we come on the battery a lot of time 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.390
 and we've been analyzing all this 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.550
 the process of the carnival and so we 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.160
 to be the lover of music in the first place 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.980
 Samba lover we live in rhythm 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.410
 of this possibility of generating the will 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.860
 in the mixed hit of performing of 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.959
 do what the musical challenge is for 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.599
 jesus has a dude he's super risky 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.769
 that you see only the people sing for 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.510
 then back 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.269
 You do not think he had that moment. 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.760
 has a detune be our dangerous 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.579
 this on the avenue on parade day 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.200
 It's really not risky for us. 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.930
 so we like challenges 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.739
 really and so the people sing when the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.620
 hose 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.690
 then the people carry real people and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.750
 so today technically 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.590
 we know this is not the sound of the day 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.540
 of the parade 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.600
 we have a car that does not sound 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.609
 does not reach the volume required for 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.590
 our battery as well as other batteries 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.600
 are thus very sure of the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.620
 what are we going to do because I know that 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.620
 the people sing with the hose 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.240
 i 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 ae
