00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
oil and then it says first cold-pressed

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.660 
oil and then it says first cold-pressed
and<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.020> means<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.440> best<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.979> best<00:01:12.130> so

if you knew cold-pressed olive oil it's
better<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.010> reason<00:01:15.220> why<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.520> need<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.729> do

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
better the reason why you need to do

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.840 
better the reason why you need to do
cold-pressed<00:01:16.690> is<00:01:16.990> if<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:17.560> heat<00:01:17.979> olive<00:01:18.250> oil

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
cold-pressed is if you heat olive oil

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.090 
cold-pressed is if you heat olive oil
it<00:01:19.149> becomes<00:01:19.630> an<00:01:19.840> oxidizer<00:01:20.469> oil<00:01:20.829> becomes

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
it becomes an oxidizer oil becomes

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.279 
it becomes an oxidizer oil becomes
literally<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.399> hydrogenated<00:01:22.240> oil<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:23.020> goes

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
literally a hydrogenated oil it goes

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.920 
literally a hydrogenated oil it goes
from<00:01:23.439> being<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.799> good<00:01:24.070> fat<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.000> bad<00:01:25.299> fat<00:01:25.659> so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
from being a good fat to a bad fat so

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.090 
from being a good fat to a bad fat so
make<00:01:26.110> sure<00:01:26.140> again<00:01:26.439> your<00:01:26.619> olive<00:01:26.829> oils
