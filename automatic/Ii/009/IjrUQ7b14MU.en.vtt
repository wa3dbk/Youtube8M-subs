00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
going to coat up my brush i go side to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
going to coat up my brush i go side to
side<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.820> sure<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.450> nice<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
side or really make sure it's nice and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310 
side or really make sure it's nice and
coated<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:38.880> i<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.540> gel<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
coated what i like about the gel is that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.499 
coated what i like about the gel is that
it<00:01:40.500> keeps<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> hairs<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> place<00:01:41.400> once<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.180> sets

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it keeps the hairs in place once it sets

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.929 
it keeps the hairs in place once it sets
so<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.170> almost<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.710> using<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.490> eyebrow<00:01:44.759> gel

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so it's almost like using a eyebrow gel

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.170

bottom part of my brow I always start at
the<00:02:12.940> bottom<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.860> get<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> nice<00:02:15.190> crisp<00:02:15.640> edge

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.240 

first<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.470> always<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> good<00:02:20.860> starting

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
first that's always a good starting

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.740 
first that's always a good starting
point<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.580> starting<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:21.970> underneath<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
point is starting right underneath to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.920 
point is starting right underneath to
make<00:02:22.870> sure<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.560> nice<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.210> edged<00:02:25.210> out<00:02:25.570> then

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
make sure it's nice and edged out then

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.920 
make sure it's nice and edged out then
whatever's<00:02:26.350> left<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.680> my<00:02:26.770> brush<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.190> start

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
whatever's left on my brush I start

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.650 
whatever's left on my brush I start
filling<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.760> kind<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.820> avoid<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.330> front

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
filling in I kind of avoid the front

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.530 
filling in I kind of avoid the front
here<00:02:31.990> because<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:33.340> more<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.910> gets<00:02:34.240> filled

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
here because the more that gets filled

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.690 
here because the more that gets filled
in<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.080> more<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.440> looks<00:02:35.620> obvious<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
in the more it looks obvious that you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.850 
in the more it looks obvious that you
filled<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.120> your<00:02:37.240> eyebrows<00:02:37.680> which<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.830> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
filled in your eyebrows which is a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.949 
filled in your eyebrows which is a
really<00:02:39.220> great<00:02:39.340> tip<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.910> was<00:02:40.090> given<00:02:40.300> when<00:02:40.900> I

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
really great tip that I was given when I

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:50.340 
really great tip that I was given when I
was<00:02:41.260> at<00:02:41.410> Mac

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.250 

so<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> gel<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.460> keeping<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.020> one

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
so the gel is keeping it all in that one

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.570 
so the gel is keeping it all in that one
direction<00:02:53.500> since<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.100> doing<00:02:54.340> those<00:02:54.490> little

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
direction since I'm doing those little

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.180 
direction since I'm doing those little
check<00:02:55.060> mark<00:02:55.390> motions<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.620> see<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:56.980> all

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
check mark motions you can see it's all

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.220 
check mark motions you can see it's all
going<00:02:57.520> in<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.670> nice<00:02:57.880> direction<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.630> just

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
going in that nice direction and just

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
going in that nice direction and just
the<00:02:59.350> difference<00:02:59.710> already<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.310> looks<00:03:00.490> quite

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
the difference already this looks quite

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.820 
the difference already this looks quite
sparse<00:03:01.240> compared<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.560> going<00:03:02.710> to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
sparse compared to this I'm going to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.500 
sparse compared to this I'm going to
continue<00:03:03.100> with<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> other<00:03:03.580> side<00:03:09.300> start<00:03:10.300> on

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
continue with the other side start on

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.800 
continue with the other side start on
the<00:03:10.660> lower<00:03:10.930> part<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.500> eyebrow<00:03:12.330> edge<00:03:13.330> out

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the lower part of the eyebrow edge out

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.540 
the lower part of the eyebrow edge out
our<00:03:14.140> shape<00:03:14.530> which<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.070> really<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.460> our

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
our shape which is really just our

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.250 
our shape which is really just our
natural<00:03:15.970> shape<00:03:16.240> we<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.570> want<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.960> have<00:03:17.230> a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
nice crisp line the bottom and then

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
nice crisp line the bottom and then
bring<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.460> tail<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.790> your<00:03:22.090> eyebrow<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.690> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
point on the outside there the point

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.110 
point on the outside there the point
typically<00:03:26.260> stops<00:03:26.560> right<00:03:27.280> outside<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.910> nose

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
typically stops right outside the nose

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.970 
typically stops right outside the nose
and<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.480> eye<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:28.960> a<00:03:29.080> good<00:03:29.260> reference<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
and the eye it's a good reference to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.490 
and the eye it's a good reference to
find<00:03:30.190> out<00:03:30.340> where<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.580> stop<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.210> then<00:03:31.720> also<00:03:31.990> tie

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
find out where to stop and then also tie

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.950 
find out where to stop and then also tie
together<00:03:32.770> by<00:03:33.190> edging<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.390> top<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.840> the
