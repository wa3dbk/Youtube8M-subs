00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.989
 hello everyone here I am back for you to play a bad trick 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.290
 michel boulet was not soft pocket nor in the crazy youth and I do not have 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.449
 ashamed to say it 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.220
 finally good to go back to the cut 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.249
 I was inspired by the drama style of love 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.949
 it does not seem like that but finally it's a pretty break 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 simple to make 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.570
 firstly Thursday, May 6th length 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.210
 so I'm going to do it quite roughly because anyway later when I 

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:33.209
 will take back the face 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.750
 you will all have found that my voice is enough effort but 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 so I use a microphone of its low-end so obviously we do not have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 the impression that its members 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 we will prepare for the worst so I use a comb 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 paco I do not use the crepe technique which is very effective at 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860
 know that of the executioners 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.930
 who having the deal 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930
 very good rendering 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 I'm crazy 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560
 as usual 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.960
 so you have selected the part that will be another banana 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.880
 so the little tricks to get this effect a volume 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.180
 all missteps will be your banana 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180
 it's a when you late this war the hair behind 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.190
 before tackling 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 bring you back to fight hair mass ahead what's so real a 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.820
 effect a hard worker 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.820
 so volume 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
 so here I'm going to get back to my bed wise as I said before 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.199
 of course that's what you can do with her hair 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.199
 curly there is no problem 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.739
 this case is quite interesting carme chacon step 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.619
 allows to get another race against the clock 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.799
 that I had speak for example constituted 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.059
 the banana 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.829
 and in the running the lengths 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.099
 so this corresponds to the first step and provided you make a 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.979
 crap to burst out laughing hair that's gonna give me in no other 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
 glamorous hairstyle 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.499
 coma as we could see I put styling spray and jacky on the 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.419
 banana 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 to be able to fix frizzy hair 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.449
 and two 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.319
 at the end of my spikes to actually be able to get a certain volume 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 or an exploded effect 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.119
 so here I am going to use a brush 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.689
 for the lumbar 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.689
 it's mostly in attack to try to separate the choices between 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.749
 ocsa his laurels a ni broken optional nantes way 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.129
 then I borrowed from nyc 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.969
 and we go to death h 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.790
 everything starts doing it pretty lightly crepe so to avoid getting it 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.629
 a kinky hanusic 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.629
 and a body glove 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.929
 now to spend less time in the target 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.969
 can win this year 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.969
 and get even more volume 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.259
 here is a first break 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.299
 then second step 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.910
 kibaki he also constituted a second glamorous hair salon 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 it's banana with tied hair 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.169
 we really have nothing wizard 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.629
 you are doing a cure 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.629
 trying to raise it as high as possible 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.809
 a touch of styling spray to control frizz 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.930
 8 last step 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.539
 this allows us to hold the final hairstyle 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.949
 you're not creating your ponytail in two or three weeks 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:19.979
 what did he want to ask 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 on the coast 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.999
 so the scene goes big like this here 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.240
 you look set at the base 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.240
 of the ponytail 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.370
 so me mainly to hide another 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.080
 the elastic month 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.659
 personally I use a big forceps for the good and simple reason that 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.970
 I have a big mass of hair and the whole team so flat does not fix me 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.219
 my hair 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.830
 so if you have thin hair or very little mass use small 

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:58.860
 breads space 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.879
 it is more discreet is it more beautiful to look at 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.930
 a last little bit of crepe 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.979
 to get one had popped 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.349
 and finally 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.210
 a little spray 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.210
 for my hair but morisod so for their positions 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.930
 and attaches 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.930
 I did not have my ex and nearly choke me 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.610
 and the lady 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.349
 here is our hairstyle in full borough 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.349
 was finally very easy to achieve 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.569
 I thank again for having so small tricks 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.379
 and I make mailly diners
