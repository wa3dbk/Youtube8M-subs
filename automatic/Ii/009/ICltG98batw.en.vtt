00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.880
 hi friends today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.300
 an easy notebook or leather notebook 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.269
 materials are a double piece of leather 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.120
 of the measurement of a folio plus a little more 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:23.630
 busacca snacks 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.350
 a ruler a styling glue pencil 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.790
 leather a piece of string or rope 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.680
 trapillo and scissors the first thing 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.980
 we have to do is fold in half 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 all folios about 16 folios 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 so let's achieve it in half 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.760
 let's put them inside each other to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 make the notebook inside as in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.059
 store 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.519
 we make holes as we can with a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.480
 hole-making machine in this case 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.870
 I'm going to do it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.000
 bent to get it right 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.180
 must be 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.080
 about two centimeters or so of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.080
 away 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.460
 let's do now what is the flap 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.800
 of the agenda or the notebook we are going to do 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 the measurement of the folio but the width that is 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.610
 29 and a half we are going to add 5 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:37.020
 centimeters more so let's do 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.020
 29 and a half five are 34 and a half for 21 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.700
 we already have the rectangle drawn 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.870
 We can cut it with scissors or with a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.870
 cutter as you see 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.830
 base 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.780
 what is the lapel of the agenda the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.960
 notepad now let's make a strip 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.690
 long let's take advantage of the more 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.820
 long are 12 centimeters more 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.820
 what are 34 12 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:24.659
 46 and a half we are going to do it from a 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.659
 centimeter and a half wide 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.340
 we put the folios inside 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 the edge 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.799
 we fold in half 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.010
 and we make the marks to do the 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.010
 hole 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.010
 to the skin 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.630
 we make the hole with punch 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 well let's put 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.280
 the fabric the cord the thread 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.280
 with the holes 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.790
 with the help of 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.790
 of an apex we want 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.020
 we have made two holes of it 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.020
 As the strip so that it can enter 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.020
 we passed it 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.020
 and we take the textile glue 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.230
 and we paste 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.780
 a piece like a centimeter and a half 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 and let it dry 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.400
 it would close in this way 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.400
 and we will put 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.700
 and that would be our agenda or notebook 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.980
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.450
