00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
some pretty good tactics if the Rope

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
some pretty good tactics if the Rope
they<00:01:51.780> throw<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.140> smoke<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> said<00:01:52.979> there's

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
invisible ones so it is pretty

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
invisible ones so it is pretty
challenging<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.280> these<00:01:56.369> mobs<00:01:56.759> at
