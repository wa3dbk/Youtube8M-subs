00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.990
 Lets put 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.080

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.140
 longer they have to wait that happens career 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.400
 they have to see that it gets hot and with a 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 Spoon give thanks 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.909

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.810
 Y 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.530

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.530
 pick up 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.410
 yourself 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.840
 and they see that it is destiny 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.950
 although we are going to cover it 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.379
 we wait a few minutes 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.379
 and we have to take a rag and so that 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.190
 do not burn us the popcorn we have to 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.190
 move fashion 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.310
 the amount of the sugar is how much 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.650
 amount of oil from the cantile 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.650
 for him and see how he is 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.860
 missing a little more why I need that 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.870
 it's hot fast 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.740
 be very careful they have to do 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.400
 with an adult guys looking for the 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.500
 caramelized environment and already when 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.220
 listen to it go to burst begin to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.220
 shove again 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.640
 we still us 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:31.590
 wait wait about 5 or 4 minutes 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.260
 so that already begins to burst 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.540
 listen to guys if they see how we got out of 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.620
 that liquid that is 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.620
 already started to sound 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.040
 now if they have to move him and they have to 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.700
 put him in minimums guys 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.920
 lower the hematocrit 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.030
 Y 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.030
 I must give him 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.070
 so that we do not burn pop 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.070
 knowledge 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.700
 they have to do 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.519
 listen, guys, I'm already bad at some 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.799
 few minutes the candidate is going to be 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.590
 or like us here in my country 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.360
 we call canguil or popcorn so they can 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.990
 do over there for other countries what 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.990
 they call a little 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.589
 I heard you do not stop shaking 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.570
 the pot with the factor 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.490
 listen to guys how do you hear the change 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.490
 because right now 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.740
 Y 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:18.650
 and do not stop shaking the pot with your 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
 Popcorn 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.910
 do not 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:43.479
 and we are going to put a spoon to see 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.479
 How is it going 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.990
 the preference that is a spoon of 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.990
 wood 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.300
 let's remember the two sides 

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:06.609
 13 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.130
 and put spoon we are very careful 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.230
 to our short I had been trying 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.319
 and already guys and when they sound and stop 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.319
 sound the change 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.370
 the popcorn can now turn off 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.690
 the burner but like ours 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.690
 already this song 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.120
 the shoulders 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.960
 we go 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:22.540
 What we are going to do now 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.330
 open the lid very carefully 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:30.699
 and that's how our pop looks with 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.699
 if they see our popcorn 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:42.150
 nothing 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.150
 and you put it in a carriage in a saucepan 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:50.800
 and they will always be like that, the pot will not 

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:53.219
 worry is not burned or anything 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.219
 system 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.970
 and that was all our popcorn friends 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.970
 Thank God
