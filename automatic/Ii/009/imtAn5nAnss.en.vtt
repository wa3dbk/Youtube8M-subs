00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hey people here is the thorsten again 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 and this video is about the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.960
 white balance i've already got that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 I made a video of it all 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 bit graphed 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.090
 and now I just want you to do that 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 someone still really based on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
 show example pictures and after straight 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 sometimes at different light sources 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 so to speak 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.650
 yes what is actually the white balance 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.650
 So there are different light 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.699
 Temperatures color temperatures and me 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 have here for example now one 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 Incandescent a fluorescent lamp and there 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 I just want to show what 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 the white balance actually makes up for 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.719
 the camera is just hard 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.129
 that knows how to portray as well as it does 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.489
 Actually, that's the human eye 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 Makes it a lot better but 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 the camera can not do that well 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 That's why you have to tell the camera 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.890
 what is actually white and now 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.820
 I'll just start with the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.340
 tube light here but I do 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.420
 to the video light here for it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.489
 again has a different color temperature 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 and in the pictures you see then 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 after all, not what it looks like 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 so now it is a bit dark here 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 for you but I 'll just do it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 Here is a picture now so you see what 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.909
 since actually going off 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.220
 So I am now a camera as 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.549
 white balance for example a daylight 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.170
 that's for this lamp for this 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.659
 Fluorescent lamp now wrong then do 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 I times a picture and then you see that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.869
 the light he looks orange and even 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.579
 do not know 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 and if I go on here now 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.860
 on shadows then that's natural 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 still wrong for this lamp so 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.329
 mark picture and you still see it 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.899
 redder still orange stuffier than 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.090
 before 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.939
 the right attitude would be here 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.200
 Of course, phosphor is 4000 kelvin 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.649
 kevin is just the number or worth 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.939
 how the color temperature is measured and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.550
 then I'll do it with fluorescent 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.040
 here in the picture and then you see that 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.860
 the light is not the picture anymore 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.850
 rotstich has but the light knows 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.670
 looks like and yes if I do that now 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.620
 All times doing here with the light bulb 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.190
 So I'm simply switch the times 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.200
 lamps 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.250
 I turn off the fluorescent lamp here 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.900
 and here the light bulb on so and 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.810
 If I am now with this attitude 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.930
 here fluorescent which has fit here yes 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.490
 I am doing this neon tube now 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.890
 just to give you a picture of 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.160
 this other lamp with the light bulb 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 in there you can see that again 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.800
 whole again goes into reddish and 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.870
 just not correct so that is white 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.030
 just not really know that in the picture 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.950
 you can also see on the table and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.580
 if I am here then again 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.940
 properly adjust so of fluorescent 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.930
 on artificial light so about 3200 calvin 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.170
 and then by the way , you can see that here 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.060
 Also good at the cool lamps symbol then 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.950
 that fits again then that's the whole thing 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.350
 white again 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.890
 and yes it is not any more 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.500
 falsified by wrong attitude and 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.320
 why is that important now that is 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.350
 especially important because it is just now 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.120
 in daylight or similar too 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.540
 it can be fast that the picture 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.730
 completely bluish and yes you are 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.500
 ultimately not the look like 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.530
 he is outside when you are outside 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.610
 during the daytime in sunlight makes a picture 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.770
 and I have this all wrong 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.590
 then it can be that that 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.020
 picture has complete blue cast and just 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.090
 completely profession looks and wants 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.010
 Of course we are not in jpg format 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.410
 It is difficult then later 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.670
 to change 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.190
 this is not a problem in raw format 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.130
 but we have, as I said here 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.840
 the jpg format in the eye around it 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.910
 indirectly correct 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.920
 yes i hope i could give you that now 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.450
 a little bit more clearly what 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
 it even with the white balance on 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.470
 and if you have that if he has the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.670
 graphic illustration 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.470
 of want to see then click here 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.640
 On top of it, I have that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.100
 already explained 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.980
 and here below you can still find 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.870
 others you can find a video to 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.840
 Product photography too simple 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.810
 Product photography as simple as you 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.730
 easy at home for ebay and so on 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.410
 can create pictures just look 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.790
 take a look and be a channel yet 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.480
 not subscribed has sticks down here 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.100
 subscribe to 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.960
 then missed so in future no new 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.580
 videos more about photography and 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.710
 image editing then I say now 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.220
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.220
 next time
