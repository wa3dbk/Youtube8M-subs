thought<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.400> filming<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> still

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
thought of filming these when I still

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.130 
thought of filming these when I still
when<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.159> still<00:01:26.299> chocolate<00:01:27.299> inside<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
when there was still chocolate inside I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870

kept<00:01:28.619> some<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> rapper's<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> didn't

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
kept some of the rapper's but I didn't

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260 
kept some of the rapper's but I didn't
really<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:31.400> filming<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.820> tried<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really think of filming it as I tried it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
really think of filming it as I tried it
I<00:01:33.329> wish<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> thought<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.960> anyway<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.799> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
I wish I thought of that anyway so I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
I wish I thought of that anyway so I
don't<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> Smarties<00:01:35.729> box<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.390> Google

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
don't have the Smarties box but Google

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.499 
don't have the Smarties box but Google
that<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.500> easy<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> find<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
that it's really easy to find and

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.730 
that it's really easy to find and
they're<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.659> tasty<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> buy

they're really tasty I think you buy

them<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> state<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> check<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.270> out

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530
