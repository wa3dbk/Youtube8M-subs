00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
what gives it its three dimensionality

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
what gives it its three dimensionality
okay<00:00:53.690> then<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
okay then I'm going to go with the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.939 
okay then I'm going to go with the
sponge<00:00:55.649> over<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.520> our<00:00:56.730> models<00:00:57.059> face<00:00:57.770> I'm<00:00:58.770> gonna

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sponge over to our models face I'm gonna

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
sponge over to our models face I'm gonna
sponge<00:00:59.390> pros-aide<00:01:00.390> onto<00:01:00.719> our<00:01:00.809> edges<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
sponge pros-aide onto our edges the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.469 
sponge pros-aide onto our edges the
trick<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.830> give<00:01:05.430> ample<00:01:05.850> amount<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
trick here is to give ample amount of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
trick here is to give ample amount of
glue<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.049> both<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> face<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> piece<00:01:08.520> once

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
glue on both the face and the piece once

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
glue on both the face and the piece once
they<00:01:09.630> give<00:01:09.780> about<00:01:09.930> 30<00:01:10.380> seconds<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> minute

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
they give about 30 seconds or a minute

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
they give about 30 seconds or a minute
to<00:01:11.520> set<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.450> similar<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> putting<00:01:13.049> on

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to set up very similar to putting on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280 
to set up very similar to putting on
fake<00:01:13.470> eyelashes<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.939> take<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> piece<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
fake eyelashes then take the piece and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.730 
fake eyelashes then take the piece and
you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> put<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> nose<00:01:18.740> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you're going to put it into the nose and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
you're going to put it into the nose and
you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.240> grab<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> couple<00:01:21.659> times

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you're going to grab it a couple times

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
you're going to grab it a couple times
and<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> sticky<00:01:26.060> once<00:01:27.060> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and this will make it sticky once it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
and this will make it sticky once it's
sufficiently<00:01:27.810> sticky<00:01:28.290> we're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> press

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sufficiently sticky we're going to press

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.870 
sufficiently sticky we're going to press
our<00:01:29.909> edges<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> again<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.430> sure<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
our edges in now again be sure not to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.670 
our edges in now again be sure not to
glue<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.119> fingers<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> ways

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
glue your fingers to it one of the ways

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
glue your fingers to it one of the ways
to<00:01:34.740> avoid<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.960> rigid

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to avoid that is to take a very rigid

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219 
to avoid that is to take a very rigid
q-tip<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.030> back<00:01:39.210> end<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> brush<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.530 

and<00:01:46.240> they're<00:01:46.420> just<00:01:46.750> stuck<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.790> great<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.360> is

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
and they're just stuck on great this is

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.300 
and they're just stuck on great this is
the<00:01:49.630> same<00:01:49.810> process<00:01:50.380> with<00:01:50.530> either<00:01:50.680> spirit<00:01:51.189> gum

with<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> pros<00:02:04.960> aid<00:02:05.280> I'll<00:02:06.280> take<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.549> new<00:02:06.789> sponge

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
with the pros aid I'll take a new sponge

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.090 
with the pros aid I'll take a new sponge
with<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> smaller<00:02:08.530> side<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.239> just<00:02:10.959> lift<00:02:11.290> blend

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
with a smaller side and just lift blend

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.860 
with a smaller side and just lift blend
my<00:02:12.250> edges<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.810> stipple<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:15.610> blend<00:02:16.000> some

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
my edges and stipple or blend some

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.460 
my edges and stipple or blend some
pros-aide<00:02:17.350> onto<00:02:17.709> our<00:02:17.800> edges<00:02:19.110> wait<00:02:20.110> until<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
pros-aide onto our edges wait until the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.410 
pros-aide onto our edges wait until the
pros-aide<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.069> completely<00:02:21.610> dry<00:02:21.940> which<00:02:22.269> is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
pros-aide is completely dry which is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.210 
pros-aide is completely dry which is
clear<00:02:22.780> before<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.560> add<00:02:23.680> another<00:02:23.920> layer<00:02:24.220> on

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
clear before you add another layer on

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.650 
clear before you add another layer on
another<00:02:27.220> section<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.850> palette<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.360> placed

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
another section of the palette I placed

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.680 
another section of the palette I placed
a<00:02:28.810> little<00:02:29.019> bit<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> latex<00:02:29.790> we<00:02:30.790> use<00:02:31.000> latex<00:02:31.510> on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
a little bit of latex we use latex on

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.820 
a little bit of latex we use latex on
the<00:02:32.230> side<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:33.250> sponge<00:02:33.580> away<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.850> edges<00:02:34.830> must

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the side to sponge away the edges must

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.440 
the side to sponge away the edges must
wait<00:02:36.130> for<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.550> completely<00:02:36.910> dry<00:02:37.239> which

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
wait for it to completely dry which

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.920 
wait for it to completely dry which
again<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.810> clear<00:02:39.480> before<00:02:40.480> adding<00:02:40.750> another

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
again is clear before adding another

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.800 
again is clear before adding another
layer<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.790> add<00:02:42.910> as<00:02:43.000> many<00:02:43.180> layers<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:43.780> you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
layer you can add as many layers as you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.530 
layer you can add as many layers as you
think<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.290> needs<00:02:44.730> usually<00:02:45.730> 3<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.239> 4<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.200> best

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
think it needs usually 3 to 4 is best

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.660 
think it needs usually 3 to 4 is best
once<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.840> pros-aide<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.890> latex<00:02:51.310> are

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
once the pros-aide or the latex are

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.150 
once the pros-aide or the latex are
clear<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.660> means<00:02:52.840> are<00:02:53.019> dry<00:02:53.320> now<00:02:53.590> remember

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
clear that means are dry now remember

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.069 
clear that means are dry now remember
I'm<00:02:54.370> showing<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.299> techniques<00:02:55.540> you'll

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
I'm showing you two techniques you'll

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.000 
I'm showing you two techniques you'll
use<00:02:56.260> either<00:02:56.620> pros-aide<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.790> latex<00:02:58.450> not<00:02:59.140> both

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.770 

once<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.190> powder<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.609> set<00:03:03.820> up<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.660> go

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
once the powder is set up you can go

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.430 
once the powder is set up you can go
ahead<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.079> paint<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.400> cream<00:03:07.030> makeups<00:03:07.540> are

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
ahead and paint the cream makeups are

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.710 
ahead and paint the cream makeups are
actually<00:03:08.829> much<00:03:08.980> more<00:03:09.190> difficult<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:10.239> cover<00:03:10.480> up

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
actually much more difficult to cover up

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.069 
actually much more difficult to cover up
on<00:03:11.609> latex<00:03:12.609> so<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> ends<00:03:13.359> up<00:03:13.420> being<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.780> slightly

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
on latex so it ends up being a slightly

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.860 
on latex so it ends up being a slightly
different<00:03:14.260> color<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:16.180> putting<00:03:16.420> on<00:03:16.630> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
different color and that is putting on a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.680 
different color and that is putting on a
slush<00:03:17.260> latex<00:03:17.799> prosthetic<00:03:18.100> nose<00:03:18.700> I'm<00:03:19.359> here

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
slush latex prosthetic nose I'm here

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.259 
slush latex prosthetic nose I'm here
