00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.150
 well I will show a series of projects in a very specific context 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.020
 the conditions of poverty and violence and which we have been 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.499
 Immersed in Colombia in recent years 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.409
 the step by step the work will be 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:18.950
 in the Colombian context 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.600
 a demo we have been in conflict for more than 40 years 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.369
 d the internal war 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.999
 what we have had serious displacement problems 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.249
 of population 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.999
 and this is a little pil pil what has compensated generating that type of ide 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.260
 social problem 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.900
 a large pool percentage of the city 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.690
 morten this city is 80% to 70% that is done informally 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.050
 this has led to a very high level crib 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.260
 time very low quality of civil life 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.039
 serious social problems in all that context only 20% of our 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.750
 city ​​have been done formally 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 and it's about these places where we're going to work and I'm going to show a series of 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.870
 Projects 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.210
 can basically like projects done in this type of equipment in texts 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.720
 in these kinds of situations 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.830
 the place is compact conflicts and with the need president with a search 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.150
 this even single social 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.960
 end sticks from which you summarize their ability to promote social welfare 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.750
 because a more just and sustainable society that is that what we are 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 pointing to a political and social project that we have been working on 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 the last years 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.130
 the Israelis raised intend to become a means of inclusion 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.480
 that help improve the quality of life and competitive factors 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.479
 economic in the midst of the stubbornness of the poor in Colombia 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 pelé preto I will show in the library Spain that is a project 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 developed in medellín medellín the city between mountains 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.520
 basically the central mountain range of colombia nick is a great ballet very 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.950
 long with a flat area at this point 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.090
 the whole area is going 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 riding on that mountain 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.510
 that's how I am from Medellin and almost everyone knows it as the city 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.770
 most violent in the world and that is what we have to bet on as generating a 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.840
 urban project in the hand of a series of politicians and urban sectors 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980
 we have to transform that idea that should be city postulates again 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.020
 it must be the most violent city 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 we go down not only making architectures a series of policies 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 public and urban transformation of a city 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.919
 kennedy levinson mountains geography 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.879
 and what we really wanted was 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.290
 in case what interests us much in the study is to make more sacrifices and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.330
 architectural objects understand that the paintings scatter 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.479
 in those terms 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.069
 the project more than a building as such is an element of the landscape a 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.099
 element of the landscape that belonged to medellín as well as this crystal 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.099
 e shops of the mountain emerge from it 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.120
 although identifiable at a distance 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.810
 in the same matter in trips there was gps of that approximation 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.279
 we started because it's a project 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.649
 What I was most interested in about this project was that it could be tinted 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.789
 sicav from the distance that the inhabitants of that place who had lived during 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:51.079
 many years 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.819
 under the violence of drug trafficking want the place also where Pablo 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.549
 escobar had sun 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.269
 your part could feel proud to say there is a lot 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.959
 I live in that emergency place three elements is the new city symbol 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.199
 as a symbol of 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.799
 from Medellin 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.229
 this neighborhood worked as the headquarters of Pablo Escobar 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:14.190
 What we are trying to hide was how to convert 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.189
 the building in such a way the mind of the inhabitants of Medellín 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.379
 in understanding that the symbol will not remain that resurgence of 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.919
 most cities where the mountain as explained before pay 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.880
 built informally 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.050
 on a very high slope in the specific site where the library was and 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.829
 a slope around 45% 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.729
 and there was an urban project of the previous administration that is 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.579
 fundamental and that I think the one that makes it visible that builds the age from 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.409
 library that was a transport system through the metro cable 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.379
 that goes through the valley 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.259
 connects with him with the conil with the top of the city 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.489
 and allowed this place zulia visible kelati that its inhabitants can get 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.469
 quickly and efficiently to 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.469
 what we do is that these three elements that make up the 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.769
 let's say peace in part of the mountain and what we do is what is in general these 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.259
 these three volumes these three volumes weigh 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.279
 part of the building's library 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.039
 as such an icon is a recognizable element at a distance this context 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.090
 is to implant 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.760
 and that's that idea where I'm from, I belong to that place 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.340
 that new building that transforms on foot I was a new model of city that 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.639
 we're developing 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.509
 here you see the sand the library as a visible element in much of the 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.050
 Medellin city 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.050
 emerging from the mountain 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.319
 the text is a contest and if all the projects as demonstrated are 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.000
 contests 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.940
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.509
 the program really had a single large building or physio 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.930
 and then in common 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.849
 a single 'break' of a single large body 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.849
 we are very interested in the others in the studio 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.599
 it appears to deny a thing we call the two for one 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.199
 we make a building that is a library but that can serve to 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.039
 many other things socially salary but it can serve as an element of 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.660
 training hits you can serve 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 and it can have a multiplication in the uses and that we are well working that 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.349
 What does it mean 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.919
 that if the library the official 7 to 7 we can have part of the benefits 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.319
 who can act until 1 o'clock in the morning gilad labor mass to avoid 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.120
 this bar 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.999
 leaves at 6 in the morning to work 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.480
 I will see seven bullets 8 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.219
 the fundamental use of the building in the training part has to be 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.540
 at night rambo 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.510
 but in the morning ok eleven at night that is when people really the 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.469
 poverty 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.789
 for what we do is fragile to comment on the program and turn it into 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.869
 three buildings autonomously the first one that is what we call the 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.669
 classroom training nor sweeps the administrative part 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.030
 here what is generated is 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.020
 education for the people of the neighborhood 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.960
 that allows us that these per cent inhabitants can be trained in 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.860
 bakery in small type ministración although training a population 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.559
 so that you can come out of poverty and the omc including 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.680
 in productive terms to the city system 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.450
 the town gives me away that really is the only one that this library as such is 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.440
 where are the books scammed me to the information highlighted the system 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.849
 internet and computers that works practically casique 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.539
 eighteen hours a day 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.250
 and the cultural part that is the auditorium as such of the country 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.030
 the pp has two ways of using is what we call votes as 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.169
 multiply to the maximum 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.560
 the use of the building 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.080
 one account 3 this point to try the bottom of a platform that what 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.509
 that is reached from the cam 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.479
 and you can enter the house three volumes, your life is 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.729
 platform is a viewpoint at the top while autonomously 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.020
 here difficult that allows us 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.530
 and this is what we will achieve most of the pri that allows us to use the 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.330
 benefits as many times as possible 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.190
 ee because if something the training part can work until one of the 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.090
 tomorrow giving cando to all the population of the sector 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.090
 iphoto from the library of authors we are always looking for 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.669
 double that multiplication from the usual to the maximum fusion 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.580
 today rave practice even from the building skin but what is the habit 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.789
 if this point is the library of the center that works and operates as a 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.089
 of vacuum that are added m 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.689
 this the access zone that is now affecting the area of ​​the 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.339
 platform the auditorium 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:10.699
 the library and others in the training area 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.289
 this building is located on is pending timid in Medellin and about 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.129
 everything is watched per month 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.919
 context image 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.029
 of how the building in the center of its urban structure 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.319
 it becomes recognizable it becomes visible at a distance
