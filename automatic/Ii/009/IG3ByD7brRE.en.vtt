that<00:01:28.030> all<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.240> throttle<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.810> they<00:01:28.960> were

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
that all the throttle that they were

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.020 
that all the throttle that they were
using<00:01:29.200> befallen<00:01:30.009> their<00:01:30.369> these<00:01:30.550> guys<00:01:30.610> are

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
using befallen their these guys are

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.520 
using befallen their these guys are
probably<00:01:31.119> using<00:01:31.450> about<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.750> third<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.410> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
probably using about a third of the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.499 
probably using about a third of the
throttle<00:01:32.890> because<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.610> would<00:01:33.820> be<00:01:34.000> like<00:01:34.270> oh

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
throttle because that would be like oh

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.590 
throttle because that would be like oh
oh<00:01:35.140> sorry<00:01:35.500> I'm<00:01:35.979> recovering<00:01:36.700> from<00:01:36.850> awesome
