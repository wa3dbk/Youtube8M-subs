00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
we're not caught in situations where we

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.909 
we're not caught in situations where we
are<00:00:30.179> totally<00:00:30.539> accident<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.140> punish<00:00:31.470> us

we're getting closer to the final so you

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.440 
we're getting closer to the final so you
can<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:38.280> imagine<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> momentum<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.390> we

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
can just imagine the momentum that we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.390 
can just imagine the momentum that we
can<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.990> this<00:00:40.170> game<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
can get out of this game to go on and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.370 
can get out of this game to go on and
win<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.060> tournament

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
win the tournament

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.580 
win the tournament
it's<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> momentum<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.060> said<00:00:45.300> before

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's the momentum like I said before

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's the momentum like I said before
it's<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.220> confidence<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.060> draw

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's it's the confidence that you draw

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's it's the confidence that you draw
from<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> basket<00:00:49.080> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:51.450> know

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
from the basket you know that you know

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
from the basket you know that you know
just<00:00:51.750> keep<00:00:52.200> on<00:00:52.380> caring<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:53.220> it's<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
just keep on caring and it's that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
just keep on caring and it's that
knowledge<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:56.490> win

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
knowledge that you know what you win

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.630 
knowledge that you know what you win
four<00:00:57.660> games<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.440> question<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.130> a<00:00:59.310> consistent

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
four games in a question in a consistent

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
four games in a question in a consistent
manner<00:00:59.880> any<00:01:00.390> given<00:01:00.840> any<00:01:01.440> chance<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
manner any given any chance of of of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.870 
manner any given any chance of of of
clinching<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.330> title<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.759> as

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
clinching the title so it's it's not as

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.959 
clinching the title so it's it's not as
difficult<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.509> having<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> campaign<00:01:07.579> in<00:01:08.579> a<00:01:08.609> in

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
difficult as having to campaign in a in

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.660 
difficult as having to campaign in a in
a<00:01:09.090> league<00:01:09.299> season<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.079> I<00:01:10.109> think<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.250> cup

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
a league season so I think the cup

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.260 
a league season so I think the cup
competitions<00:01:12.359> are<00:01:12.479> easier<00:01:13.880> I'm<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.149> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
competitions are easier I'm not the one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
competitions are easier I'm not the one
to<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:16.079> gonna<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> climb

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to say I'm gonna go and climb

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.419 
to say I'm gonna go and climb
Kilimanjaro<00:01:18.109> Mount<00:01:19.109> Everest<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.859> whatnot

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
Kilimanjaro Mount Everest and whatnot

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.039 
Kilimanjaro Mount Everest and whatnot
another<00:01:20.880> day<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.149> can<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.479> those<00:01:21.749> promises

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
another day you can make those promises

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
another day you can make those promises
but<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.850> situation<00:01:24.299> might<00:01:24.450> be

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
but you know the situation might be

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.980 
but you know the situation might be
different<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:25.649> might<00:01:25.859> be<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.749> on<00:01:27.749> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
different it might be that on on on the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
different it might be that on on on the
game<00:01:28.229> day<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.649> don't<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.340> type<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
game day I don't get the type of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.539 
game day I don't get the type of
delivery<00:01:29.999> that<00:01:30.450> I've<00:01:30.719> got<00:01:30.929> against<00:01:31.350> Bhavani

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
delivery that I've got against Bhavani

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.460 
delivery that I've got against Bhavani
so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
so

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.770 
so
it's<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.490> one<00:01:35.090> thing<00:01:35.299> leading<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.659> another

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
it's just one thing leading to another

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.289 
it's just one thing leading to another
you<00:01:36.740> know<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.520> technical<00:01:37.880> lead<00:01:38.030> into<00:01:38.270> a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
you know it's a technical lead into a

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.719 
you know it's a technical lead into a
path<00:01:38.570> leading<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.080> ball<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.830> meets<00:01:40.159> as<00:01:40.520> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
path leading to a ball that meets as to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.180 
path leading to a ball that meets as to
celebrate<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:42.409> those<00:01:42.680> things<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:42.979> you

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
celebrate so it's those things that you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.399 
celebrate so it's those things that you
have<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.400> look<00:01:43.520> at<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> other<00:01:44.060> thing<00:01:44.299> I<00:01:44.540> didn't

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
have to look at the other thing I didn't

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.590 
have to look at the other thing I didn't
at<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.799> end<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.159> day<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.700> focus<00:01:47.330> on

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
at the end of the day I have to focus on

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.570 
at the end of the day I have to focus on
what<00:01:48.229> I'm<00:01:48.380> doing<00:01:48.619> which<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.799> defending<00:01:49.399> I'm

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
what I'm doing which is defending I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.130 
what I'm doing which is defending I'm
not<00:01:49.759> gonna<00:01:49.940> start<00:01:50.210> for<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.509> investor<00:01:51.049> I'm

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
not gonna start for this investor I'm

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.580
