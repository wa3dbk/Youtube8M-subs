00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
where we left off in our previous video

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.270 
where we left off in our previous video
we're<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> be<00:00:06.089> discussing<00:00:06.569> phil<00:00:07.280> phil

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
we're going to be discussing phil phil

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.690 
we're going to be discussing phil phil
has<00:00:08.580> four<00:00:08.940> categories<00:00:09.330> if<00:00:09.980> we<00:00:10.980> choose<00:00:11.309> none

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
has four categories if we choose none

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.810 
has four categories if we choose none
under<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.840> drop-down<00:00:13.170> menu<00:00:13.830> you'll<00:00:14.730> see

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
under this drop-down menu you'll see

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.470 
under this drop-down menu you'll see
that<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.450> phil<00:00:15.690> goes<00:00:16.460> completely<00:00:17.460> away<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that the phil goes completely away and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900 
that the phil goes completely away and
if<00:00:19.080> there<00:00:19.260> was<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.529> object<00:00:20.010> behind<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
if there was an object behind this that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.259 
if there was an object behind this that
object<00:00:21.420> would<00:00:21.600> now<00:00:21.810> bleed<00:00:22.080> through<00:00:22.470> this

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
object would now bleed through this

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.730 
object would now bleed through this
other<00:00:24.590> object<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:26.599> we<00:00:27.599> were<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.960> choose<00:00:28.199> solid

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
other object if we were to choose solid

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.490 
other object if we were to choose solid
which<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.160> had<00:00:29.400> initially<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> solid

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which we had initially it's just a solid

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.650 
which we had initially it's just a solid
color<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> change<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.759> similarly<00:00:33.480> how

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
color you can change that similarly how

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
color you can change that similarly how
you<00:00:33.719> change<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> outline<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.670> example<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.120> can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
you change the outline for example I can

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.490 
you change the outline for example I can
just<00:00:36.540> change<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.260> read<00:00:38.899> now<00:00:39.899> change<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just change this to read now change it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.819 
just change this to read now change it
back<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> white<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:42.020> of<00:00:43.020> course<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> use

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
back to white and of course you can use

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
back to white and of course you can use
the<00:00:44.010> color<00:00:44.190> picker<00:00:44.520> similarly<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the color picker similarly to how you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.520 
the color picker similarly to how you
use<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> color<00:00:46.739> picker<00:00:47.010> than<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> outline

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
use the color picker than the outline

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.400 
use the color picker than the outline
the<00:00:49.530> next<00:00:49.800> thing<00:00:49.980> down<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.760> gradient<00:00:51.539> now

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the next thing down is gradient now

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.790 
the next thing down is gradient now
gradient<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.690> nice<00:00:54.870> tool<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.530> gives

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gradient is a really nice tool it gives

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
gradient is a really nice tool it gives
it<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> nice<00:00:56.190> three-dimensional<00:00:57.149> effect<00:00:57.239> I'll

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it a nice three-dimensional effect I'll

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
it a nice three-dimensional effect I'll
go<00:00:58.230> ahead<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.620> I'll<00:00:58.739> turn<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> outline

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
go ahead and I'll turn off the outline

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
go ahead and I'll turn off the outline
as<00:01:00.090> well<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> pay<00:01:01.230> attention

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
as well just so we can pay attention

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
as well just so we can pay attention
more<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.789> fill<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
more to the to the fill into the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.370 
more to the to the fill into the
gradient<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.659> you'll<00:01:06.659> notice<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.049> when<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
gradient so you'll notice that when I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
gradient so you'll notice that when I
turn<00:01:07.710> gradient<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.729> other<00:01:08.909> widget<00:01:09.630> has

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
turn gradient on this other widget has

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
turn gradient on this other widget has
now<00:01:10.049> popped<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.159> green<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.970> what

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
now popped up it's it's green and what

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
now popped up it's it's green and what
I'll<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.340> move<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I'll also do is just so we can move in a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
I'll also do is just so we can move in a
little<00:01:15.030> closer<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:17.360> go<00:01:18.360> ahead<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.810> select

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
little closer I will go ahead and select

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
little closer I will go ahead and select
this<00:01:19.619> scene<00:01:19.979> area<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> press<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.270> spacebar

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
this scene area and press my spacebar

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
this scene area and press my spacebar
which<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.380> expand<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.100> window<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.210> can

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
which will expand my window and you can

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
which will expand my window and you can
go<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:25.200> pressing<00:01:25.439> spacebar<00:01:25.979> again

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
go back just by pressing spacebar again

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.210 
go back just by pressing spacebar again
so<00:01:27.240> I'll<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.570> press<00:01:27.990> space<00:01:28.320> bar<00:01:28.350> select<00:01:28.950> our

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so I'll just press space bar select our

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.890 
so I'll just press space bar select our
object<00:01:29.700> now<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.509> easier<00:01:30.840> time

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
object now you have an easier time

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.490 
object now you have an easier time
seeing<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.860> widget<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.540> green<00:01:33.930> widget

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
seeing this widget so this green widget

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.609 
seeing this widget so this green widget
is<00:01:35.040> made<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.880> pretty<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.930> parts<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
is made up of pretty much two parts this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.670 
is made up of pretty much two parts this
outside<00:01:38.579> circle<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> there's<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
outside circle and then the there's a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.190 
outside circle and then the there's a
smaller<00:01:41.070> inside<00:01:41.670> circle<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> outside

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
smaller inside circle so the outside

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.490 
smaller inside circle so the outside
circle<00:01:44.009> basically<00:01:44.159> affects<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:45.509> smooth<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
circle basically affects how smooth the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.399 
circle basically affects how smooth the
transition<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:47.490> between<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.720> colors<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
transition is between the two colors of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
transition is between the two colors of
your<00:01:49.560> gradient<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.180> we'll<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
your gradient right now what we'll do is

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
your gradient right now what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:51.810> quickly<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.350> back<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> I'll<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
we'll quickly go back and I'll just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.120 
we'll quickly go back and I'll just
change<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.079> gradient<00:01:55.079> color<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.799> first

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
change this gradient color the first

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.459 
change this gradient color the first
color<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:57.270> maybe<00:01:57.630> something<00:01:58.079> more<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
color to maybe something more of a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
color to maybe something more of a
yellow<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> second<00:02:00.840> color<00:02:01.049> will<00:02:01.350> leave

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
yellow and the second color will leave

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.910 
yellow and the second color will leave
as<00:02:01.799> blue<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> I'll<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.799> select<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
as blue so I'll go back here select the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
as blue so I'll go back here select the
object<00:02:05.340> again<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.869> affecting<00:02:07.229> how

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
object again so this is affecting how

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.859 
object again so this is affecting how
smooth<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.179> transition<00:02:09.179> between<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.690> two

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
smooth that transition between the two

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.170 
smooth that transition between the two
colors<00:02:10.170> are<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:11.280> you'll<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
colors are what you'll want to do is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
colors are what you'll want to do is
when<00:02:12.690> you're<00:02:12.840> creating<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.410> object

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
when you're creating an object

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.700 
when you're creating an object
you're<00:02:14.190> using<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.790> gradient<00:02:15.300> you'll<00:02:15.870> want<00:02:16.590> to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
you're using a gradient you'll want to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.110 
you're using a gradient you'll want to
make<00:02:17.040> sure<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.670> outside<00:02:18.740> circle

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
make sure that this outside circle

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
make sure that this outside circle
encompasses<00:02:21.120> your<00:02:21.510> object<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:23.069> make

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
encompasses your object so it to make

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.460 
encompasses your object so it to make
sure<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.610> trying<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> transition<00:02:25.140> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
sure that that trying to transition is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
sure that that trying to transition is
nice<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> smooth<00:02:26.190> always<00:02:26.850> make<00:02:27.060> sure<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
nice and smooth always make sure that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.570 
nice and smooth always make sure that
this<00:02:27.660> outside<00:02:28.260> circle<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> larger<00:02:28.890> than<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this outside circle is larger than the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900 
this outside circle is larger than the
object<00:02:30.470> else<00:02:31.470> you'll<00:02:31.950> start<00:02:32.310> having<00:02:32.640> some

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
object else you'll start having some

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.440 
object else you'll start having some
some<00:02:33.570> breakdown<00:02:34.970> start<00:02:35.970> having<00:02:36.270> some

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
some breakdown start having some

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.560 
some breakdown start having some
artifacts<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.520> inner<00:02:38.820> circle

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
artifacts now this inner circle

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.470 
artifacts now this inner circle
basically<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:41.300> not<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.280> second<00:02:44.910> color<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
basically is not the the second color it

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
basically is not the the second color it
again<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.320> not<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.070> blue<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
again it's it's not this blue not the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.260 
again it's it's not this blue not the
one<00:02:48.450> hundred<00:02:48.870> percent<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.650> blue<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:51.120> it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
one hundred percent of this blue what it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.750 
one hundred percent of this blue what it
is<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.230> fifty<00:02:52.739> percent<00:02:53.280> mark

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is is it's the fifty percent mark

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.920 
is is it's the fifty percent mark
basically<00:02:54.750> where<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.070> first<00:02:56.910> color<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
basically where the first color and the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.620 
basically where the first color and the
second<00:02:58.410> color<00:02:59.030> transition<00:03:00.030> between<00:03:00.360> each

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
second color transition between each

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.870 
second color transition between each
other<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.650> were<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.860> move<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.340> center

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
other so if I were to move this center

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.479 
other so if I were to move this center
point<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.600> all<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.290> over<00:03:04.680> here<00:03:04.709> you'll

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
point here all the way over here you'll

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.479 
point here all the way over here you'll
notice<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.900> object<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.560> completely

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
notice now then the object is completely

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.940 
notice now then the object is completely
blue<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:08.850> if<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.720> move<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.050> all<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.530> way<00:03:10.650> over

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
blue and if I move it all the way over

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.680 
blue and if I move it all the way over
to<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.250> side<00:03:11.489> you'll<00:03:11.700> need<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
to this side you'll need to see that the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.140 
to this side you'll need to see that the
object<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.410> completely<00:03:13.890> yellow<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.880> just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
object is now completely yellow so just

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.270 
object is now completely yellow so just
remember<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.050> center<00:03:16.440> point<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.920> not

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
remember that this center point is not

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.680 
remember that this center point is not
the<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> complete<00:03:19.860> full<00:03:20.850> color<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.510> that

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the the complete full color of that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.259 
the the complete full color of that
second<00:03:22.200> second<00:03:22.829> color<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.060> middle

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
second second color it's it's the middle

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.740 
second second color it's it's the middle
point<00:03:24.660> between<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.410> first<00:03:26.130> color<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.880> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
point between the first color and the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.800 
point between the first color and the
second<00:03:28.200> color<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.820> can<00:03:30.030> move<00:03:30.600> this

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
second color and you can move this

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.949 
second color and you can move this
around<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.910> change<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.329> angle<00:03:33.720> for

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
around you can change the angle for

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.640 
around you can change the angle for
example<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.910> where<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:38.269> first<00:03:39.269> color<00:03:39.650> exists

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
example so where this first color exists

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.860 
example so where this first color exists
on<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.220> object<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.940> how<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.540> would<00:03:42.840> use

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
on this object and how you would use

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.280 
on this object and how you would use
this<00:03:43.290> or<00:03:43.950> one<00:03:44.430> technique<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.600> how<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.989> would

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
this or one technique on how you would

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.370 
this or one technique on how you would
use<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:47.010> let's<00:03:47.880> say<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.780> had<00:03:48.989> another

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
use this is let's say you had another

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.890 
use this is let's say you had another
blob<00:03:49.829> here<00:03:50.250> or<00:03:50.430> another<00:03:50.730> object<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.720> had

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
blob here or another object like you had

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.440 
blob here or another object like you had
a<00:03:51.930> son<00:03:52.410> we'll<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.459> say<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.030> son

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
a son we'll just say this is the son

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.550 
a son we'll just say this is the son
I'll<00:03:54.780> quickly<00:03:55.019> make<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.530> yellow<00:03:58.610> here<00:03:59.610> and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
I'll quickly make it yellow here and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.539 
I'll quickly make it yellow here and
this<00:04:01.560> son<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.519> shooting<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.329> light<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.549> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
this son is shooting out light and the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.460 
this son is shooting out light and the
light<00:04:05.579> that's<00:04:06.150> coming<00:04:06.329> out<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.959> here<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
light that's coming out of it here and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.610 
light that's coming out of it here and
in<00:04:07.620> our<00:04:07.860> case<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.430> yellow<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.380> have<00:04:10.590> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
in our case is yellow and I now have a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.310 
in our case is yellow and I now have a
gradient<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.940> kind<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.720> gives<00:04:13.019> that

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
gradient that kind of gives that

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.219 
gradient that kind of gives that
impression<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.810> light<00:04:16.200> is

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
impression that you know this light is

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.650 
impression that you know this light is
coming<00:04:16.739> off<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.640> glowing<00:04:18.000> onto<00:04:18.479> this

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
coming off of this and glowing onto this

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.229 
coming off of this and glowing onto this
so<00:04:19.260> there's<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> lot<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.160> effects<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.060> can

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
so there's a lot of effects that you can

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.010 
so there's a lot of effects that you can
do<00:04:21.419> very<00:04:21.720> simply<00:04:22.430> just<00:04:23.430> by<00:04:23.640> thinking<00:04:24.020> thinking

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
do very simply just by thinking thinking

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.600 
do very simply just by thinking thinking
you're<00:04:25.229> seeing<00:04:25.530> through<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.950> your<00:04:25.979> objects

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
you're seeing through in your objects

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.120 
you're seeing through in your objects
through

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
through

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.990 
through
so<00:04:29.130> that's<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.639> how<00:04:30.270> gradient<00:04:30.900> works<00:04:31.550> now<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.880> we

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
so that's a how gradient works now if we

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.050 
so that's a how gradient works now if we
just<00:04:33.780> quickly<00:04:34.440> look<00:04:34.830> what<00:04:35.370> else<00:04:35.520> we<00:04:35.759> need<00:04:35.910> to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
just quickly look what else we need to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.990 
just quickly look what else we need to
cover<00:04:36.240> under<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.020> fill<00:04:37.710> okay<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.669> last<00:04:38.819> thing

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
cover under the fill okay the last thing

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.029 
cover under the fill okay the last thing
is<00:04:39.240> landscape<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.199> what<00:04:40.500> we're<00:04:40.650> going<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.860> do

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
is landscape and what we're going to do

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.610 
is landscape and what we're going to do
is<00:04:41.190> we're<00:04:41.430> going<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.669> again<00:04:42.599> wait<00:04:43.410> on

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
is we're going to again wait on

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.159 
is we're going to again wait on
landscape<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.819> end<00:04:45.090> we're<00:04:45.599> going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.960> cover

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
landscape the end we're going to cover

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.960 
landscape the end we're going to cover
landscape<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:49.009> free<00:04:50.009> from<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.550> outline

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
landscape and the free from the outline

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.540 
landscape and the free from the outline
together<00:04:51.389> because<00:04:51.780> they<00:04:51.930> work<00:04:52.169> well<00:04:52.470> too<00:04:52.740> with

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
together because they work well too with

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.219 
together because they work well too with
each<00:04:53.789> other<00:04:54.000> yes<00:04:54.509> you<00:04:54.660> can<00:04:54.780> use<00:04:54.990> them

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
each other yes you can use them

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.040 
each other yes you can use them
separately<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.979> course<00:04:56.009> but<00:04:56.849> I'll<00:04:57.120> basically

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
separately of course but I'll basically

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.200 
separately of course but I'll basically
have<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:58.680> separate<00:04:59.130> tutorial<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.909> will<00:04:59.940> be

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
have a separate tutorial that will be

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.240 
have a separate tutorial that will be
discussing<00:05:00.599> both<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.110> those<00:05:01.259> so<00:05:01.889> that's

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
discussing both of those so that's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.219 
discussing both of those so that's
pretty<00:05:02.490> much<00:05:02.610> all<00:05:02.880> there<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.870> we<00:05:03.990> have<00:05:04.139> to

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
pretty much all there that we have to

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.219 
pretty much all there that we have to
worry<00:05:04.440> about<00:05:04.620> for<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.000> fill<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.509> in<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.080> next

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
worry about for the fill and in the next

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.840 
worry about for the fill and in the next
video<00:05:07.800> we'll<00:05:08.220> move<00:05:08.639> on<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.479> emboss
