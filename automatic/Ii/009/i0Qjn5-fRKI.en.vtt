00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.080
 how is caring for cucumbers everyone is still 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.090
 and the gardener decides for himself sometimes 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 relying only on your intuition 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.279
 however, to get high yields and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 tasty fruit you need to have some 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.600
 knowledge today in the category of 6 acres 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.779
 let's talk about how everything is right 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.090
 grow cucumbers watering for cucumbers 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 one of the most important conditions for growth 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 if the moisture is not enough fruit will 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.329
 less and their quality is noticeable 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 worsen they need to be watered regularly 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.110
 at least twice a week but obzh arut 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.329
 even more often 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 water should soak the earth well 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 the whole depth where the roots dwell though 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 especially under the roots and and pour not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.090
 best practice recommended 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.250
 grooves after watering them necessarily 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.460
 mulched grass or dry 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 by land 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.370
 but remember cucumbers need to be watered only 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 warm water water should be settling 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 in the sun have less than 20 degrees 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.049
 this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 susceptible to cucumbers if you will 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.620
 showering with cold water at the required 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 the cucumbers will appear years 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.990
 summer residents usually do not have opportunities often 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.600
 water cucumbers save the situation will help 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.490
 ordinary plastic bottle bottom 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.480
 we cut around the cork 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.680
 several holes 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.390
 drinking bowl ready near cucumber roots 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.940
 we are somewhere in the distance, you can 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.690
 10 centimeters so as not to damage 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.560
 roots we make a hole and put in there 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.150
 bottle pour water and of course 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.050
 during the week you will have it 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.930
 soak in 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.210
 that is, the roots will get 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.940
 direct moisture directly from ours 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.340
 trips don't forget that after each 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.590
 watering or raining the ground around the plants 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.960
 need to loosen another important condition 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.600
 for active growth and development of cucumbers 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.840
 good nutrition top dressing desirable 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 hold every 10 days whether water 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.410
 a solution of mullein water solution 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 manure of bird droppings or 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.830
 very good effect you get if 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.600
 feed nettle nettle extract very 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.480
 lots of nitrogen potassium calcium and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.320
 these are the elements that are necessary for 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.640
 growth and development of cucumber 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.920
 most convenient to grow cucumbers on 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.989
 trellis in this form to care for them 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.690
 much simpler than the bushes that 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.030
 subsequently takes up the whole bed to 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.220
 form the correct liana the first two 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.830
 Ovary need to break 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.770
 after that when we cut 1 and the ovaries 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.710
 authors appeared and we shoots them too 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.310
 we break off somewhere over the third fourth 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.170
 leaf and shoots appear third 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.920
 order here on them basically and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.470
 the main crop is sometimes formed on 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.810
 cucumbers many empty colors causes 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.470
 be a few examples have been sown not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.710
 warmed up and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.840
 or very fresh seeds if very much 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.180
 men flower make dressing 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 superphosphate take 60 70 grams 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 superphosphate dilute in 10 liters of water 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.110
 let her stand at least a little 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.660
 day 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:29.209
 light and this solution pour cucumbers 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.150
 very soon the ratio of masculine and 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 female flowers will be your favor but 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.630
 empty land and do not break otherwise it will not be 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 pollination for better pollination on the bed 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.310
 with cucumbers we can attract bees of course 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.860
 sow the bar to the target calendula in advance 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.720
 somewhere along the edge if not near 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.590
 flowering plants can be yourself 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.500
 organize 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.430
 mini flower bed putting on the garden jar with 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.459
 a bunch of flowers 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.850
 clean cucumbers need as often as possible from 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.950
 it depends on how the crop will be 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.989
 the grown cucumber is gone and visibly hangs on 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.730
 cucumber plate in it starts 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.650
 seeds form and here's a cucumber 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.250
 he rebuilt all the nutritional 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.459
 substances 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.709
 sends to seed formation and their 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.620
 food that is the direction of a kind 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.080
 and thus do not form new flowers 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.380
 does not form new ovaries so 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.360
 harvest decrease 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.090
 and still try to tear at once 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.400
 non-standard Zelentsy accrete manes and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.710
 or the form of a bulb whip with such 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.070
 cucumbers do not give the ovary that is 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.420
 refuses fruits 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.840
 experienced gardeners have their own ways 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.010
 Cultivation of cucumbers developed over the years 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.620
 today's program is likely 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.320
 more useful for beginners will be happy 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.720
 If our advice you will need high 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.230
 you harvests and see you again in the rubric 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.230

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.230
 weakened planting transplant trimming 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.110
 transfer plants to more 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.560
 auspicious time is a good day for 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.250
 carrying out watering and feeding all 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.590
 of plants 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:26.880
 especially root crops on June 14 and 15, the moon 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.170
 decreasing in the capricornus constellation and 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.900
 favorable for planting seeding 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.130
 transplanting all plants especially 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.730
 bulbous and root crops we sow

 for winter storage of onions we change mustache 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.860
 nodules for seedlings 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.290
 water and feed all the vegetables 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.770
 Plant organic fertilizers 16

 plant growth and development sowing and 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.760
 planting plant transplant during this period
