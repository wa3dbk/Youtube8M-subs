there's<00:03:56.190> two<00:03:56.370> things<00:03:56.549> first<00:03:56.879> there<00:03:57.090> was<00:03:57.180> this

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
there's two things first there was this

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.629 
there's two things first there was this
this<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:58.260> really<00:03:58.560> wanted<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.949> be<00:03:59.159> Knox<00:03:59.400> to

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
this we really wanted to be Knox to

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.250 
this we really wanted to be Knox to
provide<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.180> something<00:04:00.389> completely<00:04:00.930> fresh

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
provide you something completely fresh

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
provide you something completely fresh
like<00:04:01.769> we<00:04:01.919> did<00:04:02.069> char<00:04:02.310> dimension<00:04:02.699> in<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.879> edge

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
like we did char dimension in the edge

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.059 
like we did char dimension in the edge
of<00:04:03.209> time<00:04:03.449> but<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:04.049> wanted<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.409> reinvent

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
of time but we wanted to reinvent

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.099 
of time but we wanted to reinvent
spider-man<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:06.569> that's<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> first<00:04:07.049> thing

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
spider-man so that's the first thing

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.990 
spider-man so that's the first thing
second<00:04:07.620> thing<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.919> that<00:04:07.949> every<00:04:08.579> fan<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:08.970> there

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
second thing is that every fan out there

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.149 
second thing is that every fan out there
was<00:04:09.359> telling<00:04:09.689> us<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.500> guys<00:04:10.680> did<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.889> great<00:04:11.069> job

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.770 
was telling us you guys did a great job
with<00:04:11.370> shower<00:04:11.729> dimension<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.389> where's<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
with shower dimension now where's the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.939 
with shower dimension now where's the
open<00:04:13.019> world<00:04:13.139> where's<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.560> free-roaming

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
open world where's the free-roaming

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.310 
open world where's the free-roaming
element<00:04:14.579> how<00:04:14.790> can<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.150> have<00:04:15.659> this<00:04:15.840> ultimate

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
element how can I have this ultimate

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.800 
element how can I have this ultimate
playground<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.190> spider-man<00:04:17.659> that<00:04:18.659> is

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
playground that spider-man that is

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.439 
playground that spider-man that is
spider-man<00:04:19.409> so<00:04:19.979> that's<00:04:20.549> why<00:04:20.729> we<00:04:20.759> developed<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
spider-man so that's why we developed a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.820 
spider-man so that's why we developed a
Manhattan<00:04:22.049> but<00:04:22.169> we<00:04:22.380> did<00:04:22.529> not<00:04:22.650> do

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
Manhattan but we did not do

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.230 
Manhattan but we did not do
any-any<00:04:24.830> Manhattan<00:04:25.490> it's<00:04:25.670> actually<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> new

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
any-any Manhattan it's actually a new

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.360 
any-any Manhattan it's actually a new
and<00:04:26.390> evolved<00:04:26.690> Manhattan<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.530> changes<00:04:28.220> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
and evolved Manhattan it changes the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.030 
and evolved Manhattan it changes the
story<00:04:28.580> change<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:30.170> it's<00:04:30.590> awesome

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
it's going to be the best-looking

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.080 
it's going to be the best-looking
