00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 was weighed good today I'm here to talk 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.760
 with you about light and shadow 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.440
 many people had asked me about 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 subscribe for light to make a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.440
 video explaining how very upright 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.560
 it works and such 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 and that's how it is you guys are not going to have big 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.680
 of this video knowing how to do perfectly 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.080
 light and shadow you will know how to do it 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 to observe light and shadow this is a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 exercise that has like all the time 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 day every time it was draw received 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.590
 we are where we are shoulder and just so I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 I'll improve with training, then I will. 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340
 explain how you do it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.190
 the idea is from this you go 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 training in your house and doing 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.900
 Since then I've been here in a good place. 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.150
 dark 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.700
 I know you have an object 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.710
 all the light and shadow of it and that 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.460
 like flashlight 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.460
 I'm up here on top of him 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.550
 can realize that it practically does not give 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.750
 to see shadow is gaining face 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:27.080
 so see if I stand behind 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:32.240
 see how the shadow grows the expensive athlete 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 if I put here to the side and back and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:44.540
 This side here becomes clear to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:49.550
 same thing was soon ahead 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.360
 even backwards and focus on any 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.960
 place 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.480
 O sir, you just wait downstairs. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 piece that parades it completely 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.100
 dark and on the wall 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:19.970
 in the imaginary drawing cost by the partners 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 Test reason never even difference with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.570
 fun 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.439
 everything you said or you're going to paint 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.670
 Darker we make it clear 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.890
 including in the account also with a tablet 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.500
 now I want to show you one more exercise 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.459
 practical for you to realize 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.750
 better where I'm seeing my shadow the most 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.299
 always things to do to get a 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.489
 light and shadow reference because it does not 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.739
 does in the shadow that a poll does not have 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.319
 nothing to see if it's not here then you 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.060
 You have to know where to come to light and have 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.430
 difficulty figuring it out look at photos 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.299
 of enough help 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 look at this photo that gives for example to 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.060
 see that I like it to light 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.939
 on this side, the sound is probably 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.579
 coming from an older direction here 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:18.280
 not too much aside a little in front 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:22.450
 her and the shadow below her cheeks 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.379
 under the nose at the neck of the funeral 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.720
 will not shade down 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.660
 Look at her arm, this side is fine. 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.049
 clear 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.239
 I listen to every quarantine hour 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.319
 farm very dark because of the short 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.919
 everything like shade on clothes everything 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.260
 that has volume comes out what has 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.780
 Depth comes to the inside that's to 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 outside makes it clear that it was in from 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.760
 dark now only in chat 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.190
 This game is doubled, it's very dark. 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.489
 the part that is being made out 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.069
 the volume is clear that's how it goes 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.780
 do in all your examples gave 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:21.850
 deep inside let's say so 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:24.160
 hides out x 1 Ghana makes clear that 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.040
 this habit of perceiving where we have 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.950
 Shadow do tests pick it up leaving us 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.100
 unplugged take a flashlight a 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.680
 Are you making fun of yourself? 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.890
 for you to realize if they oppose the light here 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.200
 When will you make only the support funds? 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.540
 She brings me where is going to take place where it goes. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.310
 have shade that everything has light and shadows 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.480
 if we do not see everything that we 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.630
 in them subject 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.000
 You have trouble seeing a light. 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.590
 on a photo a drawing place on 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.380
 black and white on the same computer 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.400
 day in photoshop any photoshop 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.380
 happy leaves in black and white have goes 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.360
 to be easier we should all shoulders 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.770
 than in a colorful concept is to be a 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.200
 video of today I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.060
 I hope you have learned how to do it. 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.160
 have any further questions about the use and 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.620
 shadow I did not answer I leave here one 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.390
 comment but basically this is what I 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.400
 I said that it is a matter of observing this 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.740
 The question of training the eye to see 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.260
 so out of the blue you will not notice if 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.720
 have to train see photo noticed before 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.470
 the choice of taquara is as simple as that. 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.900
 but not so much 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.730
 The right facebook page is short 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.620
 because there I put several tips of 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.560
 drawing placed the drawing of others 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.930
 illustrators put my drawings on 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.580
 fashion hair makeup I put a lot 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.780
 thing in there so short 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.540
 and do not forget to go in there and enjoy the
