I'm<00:05:05.790> gonna<00:05:05.880> talk<00:05:06.150> about<00:05:06.300> boosting<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:07.050> mean<00:05:07.950> I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
I'm gonna talk about boosting I mean I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.710 
I'm gonna talk about boosting I mean I
just<00:05:08.070> on<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.850> map<00:05:09.060> there<00:05:09.300> was<00:05:09.390> these<00:05:09.510> two

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
just on that map there was these two

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.600 
just on that map there was these two
people<00:05:10.020> they<00:05:10.410> found<00:05:10.440> every<00:05:10.950> location<00:05:11.310> to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
people they found every location to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.630 
people they found every location to
boost<00:05:11.820> if<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.420> had<00:05:12.570> not<00:05:12.750> been<00:05:12.810> for<00:05:13.110> vsat<00:05:13.710> you

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
boost if it had not been for vsat you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.850 
boost if it had not been for vsat you
probably<00:05:14.940> wouldn't<00:05:15.180> noticed<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:15.990> i<00:05:16.260> think<00:05:16.800> i

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
probably wouldn't noticed but i think i

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.940 
probably wouldn't noticed but i think i
got<00:05:16.980> 10<00:05:17.340> kills<00:05:17.700> off<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:18.510> i<00:05:18.860> might<00:05:19.860> have

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
got 10 kills off of that so i might have

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.630 
got 10 kills off of that so i might have
boosted<00:05:20.280> with<00:05:20.430> him<00:05:21.500> anyways<00:05:22.500> it's<00:05:23.310> roughing

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
boosted with him anyways it's roughing

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.340 
boosted with him anyways it's roughing
the<00:05:23.910> end<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.600> game<00:05:24.630> play<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.670> uh<00:05:26.670> I<00:05:27.350> hope

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
the end of the game play and uh I hope

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.780 
the end of the game play and uh I hope
you<00:05:28.530> enjoyed<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.010> i<00:05:29.100> think<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.580> world

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
you enjoyed it i think this is a world

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.120 
you enjoyed it i think this is a world
record<00:05:29.940> first<00:05:30.540> team<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.840> i'll<00:05:31.260> manage<00:05:31.560> three

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
record first team to i'll manage three

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.580 
record first team to i'll manage three
nuclear<00:05:32.640> all<00:05:33.000> from<00:05:33.300> different<00:05:33.330> players<00:05:33.810> the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
nuclear all from different players the

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.680 
nuclear all from different players the
whole<00:05:34.740> team<00:05:34.950> nuclear<00:05:35.430> i<00:05:35.580> think<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.360> complete

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
whole team nuclear i think a complete

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.350 
whole team nuclear i think a complete
record<00:05:36.930> would<00:05:37.230> be<00:05:37.320> 6v6<00:05:38.120> everyone<00:05:39.120> getting

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
record would be 6v6 everyone getting

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.220 
record would be 6v6 everyone getting
nucleus<00:05:39.780> but<00:05:40.500> i'll<00:05:40.680> think<00:05:40.860> that's<00:05:41.070> possible

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
nucleus but i'll think that's possible

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.140 
nucleus but i'll think that's possible
hope<00:05:43.230> you<00:05:43.380> enjoyed<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.800> video<00:05:43.980> thank<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.030> for
