00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
are in inhabit arid regions so they can

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.410 
are in inhabit arid regions so they can
collect<00:06:34.820> the<00:06:35.060> morning<00:06:35.300> dew<00:06:35.690> and<00:06:37.120> get<00:06:38.120> it<00:06:38.240> off

water<00:06:42.140> towards<00:06:42.620> their<00:06:43.160> mouth<00:06:44.020> it's<00:06:45.020> really

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
water towards their mouth it's really

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.670 
water towards their mouth it's really
incredible<00:06:46.010> if<00:06:46.340> you<00:06:47.000> can<00:06:47.180> get<00:06:47.390> that<00:06:47.600> close<00:06:48.380> and

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
incredible if you can get that close and

incredible if you can get that close and
it's<00:06:48.770> really<00:06:49.040> tough<00:06:49.280> with<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.580> camera<00:06:50.740> and

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
it's really tough with the camera and

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.020 
it's really tough with the camera and
watch<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.790> water<00:06:53.030> by<00:06:53.780> capillary<00:06:54.230> action<00:06:55.030> move

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
watch the water by capillary action move

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.810 
watch the water by capillary action move
up<00:06:56.270> the<00:06:56.510> head<00:06:56.750> around<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:57.770> corner<00:06:58.160> right<00:06:58.370> down

up the head around the corner right down
to<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.240> lips

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.979
