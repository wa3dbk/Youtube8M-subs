00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
could make more money now it's just a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.180 
could make more money now it's just a
wish<00:01:46.490> okay<00:01:47.180> but<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> goal<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.560> something<00:01:48.830> that

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
wish okay but a goal is something that

you<00:01:49.430> must<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:52.100> see<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.400> difference<00:01:52.730> is<00:01:53.660> a

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
you must do you see the difference is a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.030 
you must do you see the difference is a
wish<00:01:54.830> is<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:55.490> aprendiz<00:01:56.030> Noella<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:57.320> God<00:01:57.680> is

a necessity okay so the first hole is a

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.460 
a necessity okay so the first hole is a
good<00:02:01.100> ball<00:02:01.340> must<00:02:02.330> be<00:02:03.230> written<00:02:04.010> down<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.470> last
