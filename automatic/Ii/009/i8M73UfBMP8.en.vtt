rubber<00:01:54.149> bands<00:01:54.479> around<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.110> Leon<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:55.950> fun

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
rubber bands around it Leon it was fun

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
rubber bands around it Leon it was fun
designing<00:01:56.460> these<00:01:56.670> wasn't<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.750> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
designing these wasn't it you kind of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.179 
designing these wasn't it you kind of
have<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.229> make<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.560> marver<00:01:58.860> go<00:01:59.009> all

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
have to just make your marver go all

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
have to just make your marver go all
over<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.490> place<00:01:59.700> we<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> stem<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:00.990> we

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
over the place we have a stem that we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.319 
over the place we have a stem that we
designed<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> there's<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.000> Leon<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
designed here and there's the one Leon a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.200 
designed here and there's the one Leon a
design<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.500> grandma<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.969> just

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
design for my grandma then you just

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.380 
design for my grandma then you just
simply<00:02:06.570> attach<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.740> touch<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.789> flower<00:02:09.060> right

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
simply attach it touch your flower right

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
simply attach it touch your flower right

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
on the back with some glue let it dry a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.760 
on the back with some glue let it dry a
grown-up

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
grown-up

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.700 
grown-up
take<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.310> container<00:02:15.320> take<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.380> pair<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
take your container take a pair of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.250 
take your container take a pair of
scissors<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.460> grown-up<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:18.090> punch<00:02:18.960> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
scissors and a grown-up can punch a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.300 
scissors and a grown-up can punch a
little<00:02:19.410> hole<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.660> there<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:23.160> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
little hole in there there we go and I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.090 
little hole in there there we go and I
think<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.000> think<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.020> yep<00:02:25.560> here's<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.890> stem

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
think I think we have yep here's a stem

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.460 
think I think we have yep here's a stem
you<00:02:26.220> designed<00:02:26.520> earlier<00:02:26.700> when<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:28.320> that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
you designed earlier when you put that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.780 
you designed earlier when you put that
little<00:02:28.770> hole<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.430> might<00:02:29.580> want<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
little hole in there you might want to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.030 
little hole in there you might want to
cut<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.270> make<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.540> look<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.810> an<00:02:30.990> X<00:02:31.260> that's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
cut it to make it look like an X that's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.980 
cut it to make it look like an X that's
the<00:02:32.370> best<00:02:32.610> way<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.820> hold<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.270> up<00:02:35.780> kind<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.870> like

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
the best way to hold it up kind of like

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.020 
the best way to hold it up kind of like
that<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.790> stick<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.210> stem<00:02:39.510> right<00:02:39.540> in

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that and you can stick the stem right in

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.930 
that and you can stick the stem right in
just<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.600> once<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.710> flowers<00:02:44.130> dry<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
just like that once the flowers dry and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.060 
just like that once the flowers dry and
all<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.300> pieces<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.840> glued<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.800> piece

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
all the pieces are glued on this piece

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.880 
all the pieces are glued on this piece
would<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.460> here<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.750> piece<00:02:49.080> would<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:49.710> on

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
would be on here this piece would go on

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.370 
would be on here this piece would go on
here<00:02:50.370> you're<00:02:51.000> ready<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.420> glue<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> onto<00:02:51.990> here

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
here you're ready to glue it onto here

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.080 
here you're ready to glue it onto here
you<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.710> even<00:02:52.830> use<00:02:53.040> tape<00:02:53.340> sometimes<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you can even use tape sometimes that's a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.850 
you can even use tape sometimes that's a
faster<00:02:54.510> way<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.740> use<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
faster way to do it if or you can use a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.350 
faster way to do it if or you can use a
little<00:02:56.070> glue<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.550> little<00:02:56.760> tape<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
little glue in a little tape just to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.820 
little glue in a little tape just to
keep<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.810> place<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:58.590> might<00:02:58.740> have

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
keep it in place I think we might have

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
keep it in place I think we might have
done<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.040> with<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.430> one<00:02:59.580> yes<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.270> used<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
done that with that one yes we used a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.510 
done that with that one yes we used a
little<00:03:00.660> tape<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.680> glue<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.070> you're

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
little tape and a little glue and you're

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.880 
little tape and a little glue and you're
all<00:03:02.640> ready<00:03:02.880> now<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> cover<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.260> part<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.770> that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
all ready now to cover this part so that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.250 
all ready now to cover this part so that
you<00:03:05.010> can't<00:03:05.190> tell<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.670> container<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:07.020> just

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
you can't tell it's a container we just

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.200 
you can't tell it's a container we just
cut<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> piece<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.980> color<00:03:08.280> explosion<00:03:08.580> paper<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
cut a piece of color explosion paper to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.660 
cut a piece of color explosion paper to
make<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.390> fit<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:09.900> over<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.580> cut<00:03:11.580> another
