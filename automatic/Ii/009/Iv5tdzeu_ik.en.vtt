00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.920
 so do the first exercise to go 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.090
 We are as aware as we are 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 ever go 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 I'll just invite you to the room 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.140
 to depart openly and pay attention 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.260
 which part of the foot at you as 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 first touches the ground then they will 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.199
 probably find that at 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 to them like most people 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.010
 heel is the first floor 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 then please touch them 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.219
 following exercises keep the ears 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.739
 to stick your fingers in the ears 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
 go up and down the room and stop 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.660
 the sound that you then in the body 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.000
 perceive and in the moment where the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 verse then touches the ground you can hear in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 the rule also quite a shock of the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.969
 Through the entire joints to the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.079
 head is running and in the street sounds 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.079
 that's how it is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.909
 yes, if you now hear this stomping noise 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.049
 good in itself and maybe even 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.240
 he also feels 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 let's take another step 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 I want them now 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 please go up and down once in the room 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.820
 but let's hang the foot and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
 with the outer forefoot first 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 to touch ground 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 You can achieve this by keeping your foot 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.979
 Just hang out while relaxing 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.950
 let and then touch like this 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.200
 in the drawing is painted with the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.640
 score first one then two and only on 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 end with the heel three to the ground 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 yes if you like this gang 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.649
 dominate them stuck but please 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.619
 again the fingers in the ears 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.869
 and pay attention to the noise 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.450
 They now listen and compare that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 quietly again with the stock exchange 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 they will then realize that if 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.469
 one runs over the forefoot that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.810
 noise from the foot impact significantly 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.259
 less than when walking in the heel 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 Let's just run a few 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.250
 sometimes in the room up and down times with fingers 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.080
 in the ears times without and compare 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.470
 Just the two running sounds and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.910
 perhaps 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.050
 even a bit the two run 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.050
 Feel much fun
