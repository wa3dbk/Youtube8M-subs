here's<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.439> SPD<00:00:02.310> d<00:00:02.340> double<00:00:03.240> O<00:00:03.360> three<00:00:04.549> kinetic

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
here's the SPD d double O three kinetic

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.530 
here's the SPD d double O three kinetic
direct-drive

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
direct-drive

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390 
direct-drive
I'm<00:00:07.529> just<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.830> show<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I'm just going to show you how the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.830 
I'm just going to show you how the
direct<00:00:08.820> dread<00:00:09.150> works

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
direct dread works

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.589 
direct dread works
so<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> I've<00:00:11.309> got<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> crown<00:00:11.940> popped<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.389> in

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
so the I've got the crown popped out in

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:23.179 
so the I've got the crown popped out in
the<00:00:13.070> normal<00:00:14.070> winding<00:00:14.429> position<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:22.189> check

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the normal winding position and so check

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
the normal winding position and so check
out<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> power<00:00:24.150> reserve<00:00:24.539> indicator<00:00:24.750> over

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
out the power reserve indicator over

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
out the power reserve indicator over
here<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.680> wind<00:00:26.000> it'll<00:00:27.000> actually<00:00:27.150> start

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
here and as I wind it'll actually start

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.900 
here and as I wind it'll actually start
to<00:00:27.630> show<00:00:27.830> how<00:00:28.830> much<00:00:30.980> energy<00:00:31.980> I'm<00:00:32.070> generating

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to show how much energy I'm generating

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.709 
to show how much energy I'm generating
from<00:00:33.149> winding<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> crown<00:00:35.149> as<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.450> here

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
from winding the crown as you see here

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
from winding the crown as you see here
and<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.320> along<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> keeping<00:00:38.730> tabs

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and all along it's kind of keeping tabs

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
and all along it's kind of keeping tabs
as<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:39.870> overall<00:00:40.379> energy<00:00:40.860> we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
as to how much overall energy we're

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
as to how much overall energy we're
creating<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.579> doing<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
creating by doing this you see as it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.130 
creating by doing this you see as it
comes<00:00:43.260> back<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.469> it'll<00:00:44.600> go<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:45.930> bit

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
comes back down it'll go up a little bit

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.610 
comes back down it'll go up a little bit
each<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:49.969> after<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> stop<00:00:51.390> it'll<00:00:52.170> show

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
each time and so after I stop it'll show

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
each time and so after I stop it'll show
that<00:00:52.649> initial<00:00:53.629> amount<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.840> been

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that initial amount that's been

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
that initial amount that's been
generated<00:00:55.160> then<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.670> arm<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.030> reset<00:00:57.360> down

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
generated then the arm will reset down

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
generated then the arm will reset down
to<00:00:57.570> zero<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:59.039> it'll<00:00:59.190> wait<00:01:00.090> another

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to zero and then it'll wait another

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.180 
to zero and then it'll wait another
second<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.260> it'll<00:01:01.469> show<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> current

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
second and then it'll show the current

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.109 
second and then it'll show the current
power<00:01:02.430> reserve<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> finish<00:01:05.119> generated

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
power reserve so when I finish generated

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.070 
power reserve so when I finish generated
quite<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:07.549> boom<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.840> then<00:01:09.840> BOOM<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
quite a bit boom and then BOOM so as it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.429 
quite a bit boom and then BOOM so as it
stands<00:01:13.350> we've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.010> few<00:01:14.400> days<00:01:14.549> worth<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
stands we've got a few days worth of

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.730 
stands we've got a few days worth of
power<00:01:16.439> reserve<00:01:17.540> going<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> rotor

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
power reserve going and it's got a rotor

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.640 
power reserve going and it's got a rotor
as<00:01:20.009> well<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
as well so you know you can do it the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.149 
as well so you know you can do it the
old-fashioned<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> new<00:01:25.530> old-fashioned

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
old-fashioned way the new old-fashioned

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
old-fashioned way the new old-fashioned
way<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:27.049> guess<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.619> old

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
way I guess it would be the old

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
way I guess it would be the old
fashioned<00:01:29.070> way<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.340> Seiko<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> boom<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
fashioned way for Seiko but a boom and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.890 
fashioned way for Seiko but a boom and
as<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> same<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.180> being<00:01:36.270> Mehta

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
as the same thing about it being Mehta

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.060 
as the same thing about it being Mehta
boom<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
boom so I guess really that was all I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
boom so I guess really that was all I
wanted<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.460> show<00:01:41.640> ever<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> watch<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
wanted to show ever all the watch is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.130 
wanted to show ever all the watch is
pretty<00:01:42.990> cool<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:45.140> most

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
pretty cool it's got a little most

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.179 
pretty cool it's got a little most
people<00:01:46.380> probably<00:01:46.530> don't<00:01:46.710> realize<00:01:46.799> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
people probably don't realize this

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.850 
people probably don't realize this
actually<00:01:47.549> has<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.049> helium<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.409> stop<00:01:49.619> over

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
actually has a helium really stop over

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.859 
actually has a helium really stop over
here<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.450> side<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:53.130> Everall<00:01:53.720> finish<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
here on this side the Everall finish of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
here on this side the Everall finish of
this<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.320> cool<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this is really cool because it's it's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.569 
this is really cool because it's it's
not<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.210> PVD<00:01:58.110> I've<00:01:58.259> seen<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
not like other PVD I've seen because it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.069 
not like other PVD I've seen because it
still<00:01:59.790> kind<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.030> looks<00:02:00.180> polished<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
still kind of looks polished kind of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.360 
still kind of looks polished kind of
like<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> ceramic<00:02:02.219> sort<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> look<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.340 

the<00:02:06.370> bezels<00:02:06.760> okay<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.900> really<00:02:08.110> not<00:02:08.290> the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
the bezels okay but it's really not the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.380 
the bezels okay but it's really not the
best<00:02:08.590> especially<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.910> price<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.149> this

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
best especially for the price of this

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.050 
best especially for the price of this
watch

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
watch

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.210 
watch
lines<00:02:13.060> up<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.390> everything<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:15.190> of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
lines up and everything but kind of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.690 
lines up and everything but kind of
feels<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.820> little<00:02:16.150> cheap<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> actual<00:02:18.370> dial

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
feels a little cheap but the actual dial

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.940 
feels a little cheap but the actual dial

know what you would expect from watching

this kind of price point it's all the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.400 
this kind of price point it's all the
markers<00:02:29.670> got<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.850> 4:30<00:02:31.390> date<00:02:31.660> which<00:02:32.200> some

markers got the 4:30 date which some
people<00:02:32.620> don't<00:02:32.770> like<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.740> I<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
people don't like and the I think the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.990 
people don't like and the I think the
hands<00:02:38.050> are<00:02:38.260> kind<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.130> unique<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.610> don't<00:02:39.760> see

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
hands are kind of unique I don't see

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.530 
hands are kind of unique I don't see
other<00:02:40.510> Seiko<00:02:41.080> hands<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.980> pair<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
other Seiko hands like this pair and the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.110 
other Seiko hands like this pair and the
crown<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.050> signed<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.470> well<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.730> that's<00:02:45.910> kind

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
crown is signed as well so that's kind

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.000 
crown is signed as well so that's kind
of<00:02:46.150> cool<00:02:46.360> although<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> crown<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.500> light<00:02:47.770> I

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
of cool although the crown is so light I

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.420 
of cool although the crown is so light I
don't<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.490> actually<00:02:48.670> metal<00:02:49.150> at<00:02:50.050> all<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
don't think it's actually metal at all I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.800 
don't think it's actually metal at all I
don't<00:02:51.730> even<00:02:51.880> think<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.209> would<00:02:52.330> be<00:02:52.420> titanium

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
don't even think it would be titanium

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.330 
don't even think it would be titanium
well<00:02:53.290> though<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.440> could<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.770> wrong<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.190> but

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
well though I could be wrong on that but

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.000 
well though I could be wrong on that but
it<00:02:54.670> feels<00:02:55.290> feels<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.530> might<00:02:56.560> actually<00:02:56.830> be

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
it feels feels like it might actually be

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.410 
it feels feels like it might actually be
plastic<00:02:57.640> which<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:57.820> also<00:02:58.209> kind<00:02:58.390> of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
plastic which is also kind of

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.220 
plastic which is also kind of
interesting<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> other<00:03:01.660> kind<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
interesting and then the other kind of

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.100 
interesting and then the other kind of
cool<00:03:02.350> thing<00:03:02.530> about<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.860> one<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
cool thing about this one is the the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.259 
cool thing about this one is the the
brushed<00:03:05.730> metal<00:03:06.730> keeper<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:08.350> well<00:03:08.920> done<00:03:09.269> it's

brushed metal keeper it's well done it's
pretty<00:03:10.420> cool<00:03:10.600> looking<00:03:11.489> although<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.580> does

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
pretty cool looking although it does

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.310 
pretty cool looking although it does
actually<00:03:13.269> tend<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.540> pinch<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.870> little<00:03:13.959> bit<00:03:14.110> on
