stuff it's a medically none of that's a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.229 
stuff it's a medically none of that's a
coincidence<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.950> after<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.909> die<00:02:12.030> there's

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
coincidence and after you die there's

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
coincidence and after you die there's
going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.599> something<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:13.860> got

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
going to be something more there's got

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.309 
going to be something more there's got
to<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.159> some<00:02:14.340> kind<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.640> explanation<00:02:15.049> some<00:02:16.049> kind

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
to be some kind of explanation some kind

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.679 
to be some kind of explanation some kind
of<00:02:16.499> meaning<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.489> then<00:02:17.670> kind<00:02:17.999> of<00:02:18.060> my<00:02:18.269> response

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
of meaning and then kind of my response

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.900 
of meaning and then kind of my response
to<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.469> the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to that was that the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.540 
to that was that the
universe<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.510> infinitely<00:02:21.930> large<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:23.280> at

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
universe it's infinitely large as at

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
universe it's infinitely large as at
least<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.880> far<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.270> know<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.630> constantly

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
least as far as we know it's constantly

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.630 
least as far as we know it's constantly
expanding<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.160> know<00:02:26.250> where<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> edge

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
expanding we don't know where the edge

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.170 
expanding we don't know where the edge
of<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.640> probability

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
of it is and because of that probability

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.450 
of it is and because of that probability
states<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.080> everything<00:02:31.710> anything<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
states that everything anything is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.760 
states that everything anything is
possible<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.810> those<00:02:33.930> things<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.560> in

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
possible and one of those things is in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
possible and one of those things is in
actual<00:02:35.100> fact<00:02:35.130> us<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:37.100> my<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.460> logic

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
actual fact us so I'm my kind of logic

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760 
actual fact us so I'm my kind of logic
is<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.270> course<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.080> want<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.560> believe

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
is that of course you want to believe

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.440 
is that of course you want to believe
that<00:02:40.830> there's<00:02:41.130> something<00:02:41.310> after<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.850> die<00:02:42.210> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
that there's something after you die of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.920 
that there's something after you die of
course<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:42.990> what<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.130> were<00:02:44.390> well<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> mean

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
course that's what you were well I mean

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.450 
course that's what you were well I mean
it's<00:02:46.260> fair<00:02:46.620> enough<00:02:46.860> that's<00:02:47.040> something<00:02:47.370> we

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
it's fair enough that's something we

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's fair enough that's something we
want<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> make<00:02:47.850> ourselves<00:02:48.030> believe<00:02:48.510> but

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
want to make ourselves believe but

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.930 
want to make ourselves believe but
personally<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.890> really<00:02:50.520> don't<00:02:50.640> think<00:02:50.730> there's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
personally I really don't think there's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.630 
personally I really don't think there's
anything<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:52.350> think<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.710> we're<00:02:53.190> humans

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
anything I just think that we're humans

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.540 
anything I just think that we're humans
and<00:02:53.970> once<00:02:54.150> we're<00:02:54.330> gone<00:02:54.540> were<00:02:54.930> gone<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.410> mean<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and once we're gone were gone I mean you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.190 
and once we're gone were gone I mean you
were<00:02:56.700> nothing<00:02:57.000> before<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.810> were<00:02:57.870> born<00:02:57.900> it

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
wasn't so terrible before you were born

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.770 
wasn't so terrible before you were born
and<00:03:00.710> you're<00:03:01.710> nothing<00:03:02.100> after<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.730> die<00:03:02.970> it's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000 
gonna remember this life at all then I
don't<00:03:27.300> think<00:03:27.480> I'm<00:03:28.050> gonna<00:03:28.290> refuse<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.890> believe

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
creation all of my memories and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.250 
creation all of my memories and
everything<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:38.700> what<00:03:38.880> makes<00:03:39.120> me<00:03:39.390> who<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.200> am

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
everything that's what makes me who I am

everything that's what makes me who I am
and<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.680> forgot<00:03:41.010> all<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.730> another

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and if I forgot all of that in another

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
and if I forgot all of that in another
life<00:03:42.630> then<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.020> don't<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.440> I'd<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.770> same

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
life then I don't think I'd be the same

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.320 
life then I don't think I'd be the same
person<00:03:44.160> I'd<00:03:44.400> be<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.550> completely<00:03:44.970> different

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
person I'd be a completely different

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.630 
person I'd be a completely different
person<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:46.080> shaped<00:03:46.380> by<00:03:46.680> what<00:03:47.490> you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
person because you're shaped by what you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.910 
person because you're shaped by what you
experience<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.720> kind<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.260> rejected<00:03:49.739> that

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
experience so I kind of rejected that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.790 
experience so I kind of rejected that
point<00:03:50.190> although<00:03:50.370> as<00:03:50.730> plausible<00:03:51.150> as<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.570> may<00:03:51.720> be

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
point although as plausible as it may be

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.770 
point although as plausible as it may be
reincarnation<00:03:52.940> maybe<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.330> know<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.570> there<00:03:54.750> a

reincarnation maybe you know is there a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.810 
reincarnation maybe you know is there a
heaven<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.470> football<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.340> know<00:03:56.430> all<00:03:56.610> we

heaven that the football you know all we

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.240 
heaven that the football you know all we
know<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.420> completely<00:03:57.870> could<00:03:58.140> be<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.590> course

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.380 
know that completely could be of course
you're<00:03:59.430> never<00:03:59.640> get<00:03:59.820> in<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.239> don't

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
you're never get in there and I don't

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.910 
you're never get in there and I don't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
think work you know I don't think humans

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.410 
think work you know I don't think humans
will<00:04:02.010> ever<00:04:02.040> know<00:04:02.400> what<00:04:02.550> happens<00:04:02.940> after<00:04:03.300> you

not<00:04:05.940> everything's<00:04:06.840> equally<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.560> likely<00:04:07.739> just

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
not everything's equally as likely just

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.620 
not everything's equally as likely just
in<00:04:08.489> my<00:04:08.700> personal<00:04:09.440> opinion<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:11.190> think<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:12.300> I

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
in my personal opinion I think that I

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.920 
in my personal opinion I think that I
think<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.350> there's<00:04:13.560> there's<00:04:14.010> not<00:04:14.280> much<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:15.060> I

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
think that there's there's not much I I

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.720 
think that there's there's not much I I
mean<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.680> really<00:04:16.709> difficult<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.430> me<00:04:17.549> to

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
mean it is really difficult for me to

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.280 
mean it is really difficult for me to
say<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:17.940> I'm<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.480> saying<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.169> know

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
say that I'm not saying that you know

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.740 
say that I'm not saying that you know
i'm<00:04:19.470> writing<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.160> I've<00:04:20.520> died<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.359> know<00:04:21.510> what

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
i'm writing this I've died I know what

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.710 
i'm writing this I've died I know what
happens<00:04:22.140> no<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:22.680> completely<00:04:23.510> guessing<00:04:24.510> here

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
happens no I'm completely guessing here

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.080 
happens no I'm completely guessing here
but<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.230> had<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.500> take<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> guess<00:04:25.950> that's<00:04:26.910> what

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
but if I had to take a guess that's what

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.550 
but if I had to take a guess that's what
I'd<00:04:27.210> say<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.660> I'm<00:04:27.780> I'd<00:04:28.169> be<00:04:28.320> really<00:04:28.470> interested

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
I'd say and I'm I'd be really interested

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.320 
I'd say and I'm I'd be really interested
to<00:04:28.979> hear<00:04:29.039> what<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.370> guys<00:04:29.400> had<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.789> say<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
to hear what you guys had to say if you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.420 
to hear what you guys had to say if you
were<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.930> take<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.169> guess<00:04:31.320> at<00:04:31.770> what<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.190> think

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
were to take a guess at what you think

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.590 
were to take a guess at what you think
happens

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
happens

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600 
happens
I<00:04:33.630> mean<00:04:33.720> obviously<00:04:34.080> is<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> wonderfully<00:04:35.370> nice

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
I mean obviously is a wonderfully nice

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.010 
I mean obviously is a wonderfully nice
thing<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.180> believe<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.510> there's<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.780> heaven

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
thing to believe that there's a heaven

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.630 
thing to believe that there's a heaven
after<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.470> die<00:04:37.650> where<00:04:38.250> everything<00:04:38.550> is

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
after you die where everything is

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.780 
after you die where everything is
perfect<00:04:39.210> in<00:04:39.650> kidney<00:04:40.650> whatever<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:40.980> want<00:04:41.190> but

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
perfect in kidney whatever you want but

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.160 
perfect in kidney whatever you want but
to<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.030> honest<00:04:42.270> we<00:04:42.390> could<00:04:42.540> all<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.750> end<00:04:43.020> up

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
to be honest we could all be end up

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.480 
to be honest we could all be end up
going<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.500> hell<00:04:43.680> because<00:04:43.830> I'm<00:04:43.980> sure<00:04:44.190> we've<00:04:44.340> all

going to hell because I'm sure we've all

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.670 
going to hell because I'm sure we've all
done<00:04:44.730> some<00:04:44.970> pretty<00:04:45.120> simple<00:04:45.660> things<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.170> our

think it's integral in human nature to

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.420 
think it's integral in human nature to
have<00:05:07.230> morals<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.960> coexist<00:05:09.960> together<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.680> you

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
end is that religion was necessary to

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.800 
end is that religion was necessary to
explain<00:05:23.310> things<00:05:23.700> we<00:05:23.940> couldn't<00:05:24.180> explain<00:05:24.270> in

explain things we couldn't explain in

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.530 
explain things we couldn't explain in
the<00:05:25.470> past<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.670> served<00:05:26.910> as<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.150> great<00:05:27.330> way<00:05:27.480> to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
the past and it served as a great way to

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.620 
the past and it served as a great way to
provide<00:05:28.550> models<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.970> all<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.390> kind<00:05:30.570> of

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
provide models and all that kind of

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.960 
provide models and all that kind of
stuff<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.930> be<00:05:31.170> taught<00:05:31.380> but<00:05:32.220> beyond<00:05:32.730> that<00:05:32.850> I

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
stuff to be taught but beyond that I

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.460 
stuff to be taught but beyond that I
don't<00:05:33.090> think<00:05:33.390> it's<00:05:33.510> as<00:05:33.630> much<00:05:33.870> of<00:05:34.020> a<00:05:34.080> purpose

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
don't think it's as much of a purpose

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.960 
don't think it's as much of a purpose
and<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.710> feel<00:05:34.920> like<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:35.190> practice<00:05:35.400> those<00:05:35.670> morals

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
and I feel like in practice those morals

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.000 
and I feel like in practice those morals
without<00:05:36.420> all<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.050> religious<00:05:37.590> background

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010

without all of the religious background
