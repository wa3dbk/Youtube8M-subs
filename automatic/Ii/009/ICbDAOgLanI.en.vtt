00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.380
 hello friends of the plants today we are going 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:14.080
 to talk about the hortencias so that 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.750
 you see this kind of plants are some of 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.880
 the best we can buy at the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.760
 time to plant in our garden since 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.390
 they are plants that due to their rigor 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.609
 and its foliage are ideal for decorating 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.380
 our gardens is a plant that the 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.810
 we have to have in our garden in 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.910
 a part of semi shade since if it gives you 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.610
 The direct sun withers 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.100
 would do okay now let's do the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.290
 plantation since when we bought it 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.110
 look in tiny pots as you can 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.390
 see for the roots grow well let's 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.930
 have to plant them in a gardener 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.760
 much bigger and pots I this flowerpot 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.489
 I have prepared it more or less as 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.820
 always as you know the first thing that 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 we always do is put 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.489
 the pebbles of river or stone 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 volcanic at the bottom of our flower pot 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.370
 for good drainage of the plant to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.710
 then we will throw our land 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.030
 as you already know the special substrate for 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 the plantation 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.220
 and then we will make the hole as 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.060
 always more or less we will take our 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 plant 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.009
 we will tighten what is the bottom of the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.960
 pot and we turn it around a lot 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.570
 Care is like this and gently remove it from 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 inside now how can you see the root of the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.080
 root ball is all right we will take and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.630
 we will put it inside this pot and a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.610
 very important moment remember you always 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 to put on your gloves 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.860
 we take our plant inside and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.220
 next with our land that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.620
 We will fill the gap until more 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.140
 or less have we already have enough 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.410
 earth and we will press until we notice 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.750
 that the root ball is well caught at 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.060
 rest of the earth once already what 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.100
 we have planted the only thing that we will do 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.410
 will be to catch our water you know 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.140
 other tips that water has to be 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.750
 a water not tracing already if it can be 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.840
 much better rain and we will water it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.200
 do not pour a lot of water since it is a plant 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 that does not need to be watering 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.400
 continuously just the time by watering 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.280
 little by little and as you see that it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.440
 it is drying you touch a little with your finger 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.709
 touches is the land that is drying and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.410
 you are pouring water according to how you know 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.200
 is a plant that is not very fond of 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.959
 heat lives better in areas that are 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.270
 cooler but if you have it in one place 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.910
 with semi shadow and you are taking care of 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.100
 It can take a long time to remember that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.900
 the bouquets of flowers also before 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.480
 that they get withered you can 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.000
 cut them and give them a touch when putting them 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.250
 in a vase inside the house remember 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 also what is important for this type 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.040
 plant the hydrangea what you need 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.810
 it's a lot of iron because the leaves if not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 has iron they are going to put us 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.420
 yellow 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.030
 green trunk that means no 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.520
 has iron is important when you 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.670
 put some kind of fertilizer on 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.370
 everything that has aluminum iron for 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.350
 give that blue tone of the leaves on 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.070
 everything when you see that it has some kind 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.620
 of insect if to the spider type or some type 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.489
 fly the only thing you have to do 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.450
 is to buy an insecticide and apply it 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.120
 following the instructions of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.180
 manufacturer and finally the nitrogen 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.820
 will make the plant grow and the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.760
 phosphorus to leave some leaves 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.420
 very nice flowers and up to here our 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.420
 today's advice
