00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 because he is pretty hot and not by 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.310
 the edges are woven in ground for two hours each 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:34.759

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.759
 a little run around now I will water them 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.489
 here they are already more or less dried up 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.039

 Here I have prepared a box now so that 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 I'm definitely not confused by the brothers 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:53.310
 one for example so with his beak dunked 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 dunked 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 on so here well and transplanted into the box 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:29.080

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:51.980

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.150
 kapelnik some falls next 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.739

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.420
 following 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 chomping 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.290
 so okay one hand is not comfortable well 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.290
 in general, the principle is clear
