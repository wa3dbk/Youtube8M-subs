00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Well, the guys, I hope you're 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.670
 all good and enjoy a boxing 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:14.849
 unboxing as you want reasons that you 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:18.890
 I said it's a good phenomenon it 's pretty 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.740
 affordable since it's worth 40 euros says 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 that is made of mental materials is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 ergonomic and for and for games of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 graduation this bluetooth battery is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 upgradeable as I already told you in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:41.270
 another good video let's do so we go 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:41.270
 to break it so that the plastic ones 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.910
 comes here with the functions that these or 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 more our people are worth kiko 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.730
 and plastic 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 and nothing we will see 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.340
 impressions is pretty good 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.050
 comes with removable battery 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 it's a mini battery the truth that 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:25.030
 really for 40 euros 39 with 99 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.860
 this matter that I say that I love 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.390
 because the people that someone can 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.840
 Focusing on me helps my hands a lot 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 then if I had and this is a rubber 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.550
 that the truth is that I'm caught 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.050
 the hands and the truth that 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.090
 very satisfied when I tried it with my 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.350
 partner I did not have the opportunity to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 try everything I just picked it up 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.190
 but by touch and how I saw it to simple 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.780
 Since I really could not because 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.940
 I have many, but I'm going to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.980
 tell 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.980
 impression of this I am for my point 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.740
 from view 1 to 10 they have 9 high 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.480
 since the touch of the buttons this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.420
 it's like what I say in other 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.670
 previous cases 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 What I told you about the command is that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.410
 I need to have the screw to be 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.450
 so has this hostel and also puts it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.040
 the instructions that a whole continuum or 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.590
 be that for those who play type 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.140
 shooter is going to come pretty well and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.390
 good has vibration also vibrates 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.819
 because we like to feel like a commander 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.310
 simple without vibrating has turbo mode 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.730
 the turbo mode comes in there is upgradeable 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.680
 as he says that has good is an escape 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.999
 it is an escape the only thing that is the only 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.010
 disadvantage that it does not have is that it does not carry 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.590
 the auxiliary triggers but for everything 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.040
 others do not know if you will see that is rubber itself 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.349
 because it exists you can see that the touch of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.239
 rubber but but good for those who 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.569
 there is nothing plastic anywhere 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.129
 not plastic and nothing move this 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.169
 he has it here and the cross here like me 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.819
 said that the commands of competitive or 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.370
 competition is the crosshead 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.349
 ie as the latter the most common 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.719
 conventional is the crosshead and the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.629
 analog here wins the heat pat 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.150
 analogic pad and good mark what of the 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:16.769
 buttons on all sides from 1 to 4 of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:18.569
 multiplayer has no axis 6 and nothing in 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.030
 a boxing in the maximum well nothing else 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:26.760
 well the battery the cable 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.760
 the only one that comes and nothing guys 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.340
 although down there in the link below 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.890
 I will leave the description of the joystick 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.860
 if you have not seen the other in the other 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.800
 He said that he says to announce that he 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.910
 I was going to do a boxing and that's how I am 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.920
 He commented earlier that he was 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.680
 securing but if it comes with syntax and 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:56.050
 good take with the joystick xyyz this 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.750
 movement that moves 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.270
 I am come complete and good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.010
 upgradeable bluetooth is takes six 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.770
 without axons for said to forgive with turbo 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.720
 vibration in all of that and good the truth 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.800
 what I had left would be missing in the print 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.930
 It has been quite convincing and native 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.329
 I hope this has liked this 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.329
 both zinc and they used to buy 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:31.490
 they are on fire you can on the page 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:33.740
 web the point is the companion of madrid 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.380
 that still does not have this center where 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.380
 they also understand what they have there but 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.699
 is in Madrid today in alcobendas what is 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.419
 much more divine in day the people of 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.940
 Arizona 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.520
