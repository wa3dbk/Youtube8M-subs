00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello guys let's do a little 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.860
 review of tempered glass protector 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.000
 of which we did the unboxing and we placed 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.000
 in previous videos 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.380
 This tempered glass protector 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.380
 assures us 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.480
 that has the crystal has a layer 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.480
 biofactory has a hardness 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.059
 of 89 which is far superior to those 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.520
 plastic protectors that we found 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.530
 today in the market 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.540
 is an extra point in security for the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.170
 phone 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.910
 it's good if it does not work miracles 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.710
 yes that the phone 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.980
 I had the bad luck to fall on tip 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.340
 or on a corner as well possibly 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.960
 would give us some more opportunity because 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.640
 every time the phones are bigger 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.570
 the screens are bigger have 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 less profile 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 and increasingly often we see in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 people's forums that with a fall 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.710
 insignificant whipped the screen 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.690
 so everything that is in safety then 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 good welcome be 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 yesterday when we put it on, you saw me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.370
 I complained that the bubbles were 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 I've been able to remove bubbles 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.360
 there are still small spots of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 glue 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.909
 which I hope will disappear with 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.780
 time 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.970
 the sensitivity of the screen 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 It has improved a lot from yesterday to today 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.440
 phone goes fluid 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.119
 and it's practically not noticeable if it were not 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.950
 by the small spots of glue 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.030
 Well I would not notice that I have the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.000
 projector 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.229
 I hope you do not lift it to the holster and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.229
 that does not enter dust 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.679
 and little more if you have any doubt 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.960
 you can ask in the forum and be in 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.179
 be happy to answer 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.179
 fits well with the case 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.650
 has a good edge does not lift by 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.390
 none of the corners 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 and well, that's all, guys
