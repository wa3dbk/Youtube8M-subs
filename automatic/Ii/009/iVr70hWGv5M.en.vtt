also the code is only valid for two

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
also the code is only valid for two
minutes<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> once<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.600> labs<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.710> to

repeat this process again and you get a
new<00:01:12.930> set<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.229> codes<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> also<00:01:14.250> rated<00:01:14.400> one

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
new set of codes which is also rated one

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
new set of codes which is also rated one
in<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.030> minutes<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.810> no<00:01:15.990> worries<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a new device and you have to go on and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
a new device and you have to go on and
type<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> code<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
type in the code as you can see that it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.050 
type in the code as you can see that it
is<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.340> case-sensitive<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.939> have

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is not case-sensitive so you just have

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.980 
is not case-sensitive so you just have

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to do it fast

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.420 
to do it fast
so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.290> complete<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.710> within<00:01:37.950> two

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
so you can complete it within two

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
so you can complete it within two
minutes<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.450> once<00:01:39.630> you're<00:01:39.780> done<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
minutes so once you're done with it just

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.940 
minutes so once you're done with it just
have<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> click<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> tick<00:01:42.270> button<00:01:42.540> and

have to click on the tick button and
that<00:01:43.950> should<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.250> job

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that should do the job

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
that should do the job
I'm<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> link<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:46.020> device<00:01:46.350> because

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I'm not going to link my device because

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
I'm not going to link my device because
you<00:01:47.310> won't<00:01:47.460> allow<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you won't allow it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.960 
you won't allow it
that's<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.310> town<00:01:50.939> hall

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that's because if you have a town hall

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.929 
that's because if you have a town hall
for<00:01:51.899> below<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> try<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> link<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for below and you try to link it to a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.289 
for below and you try to link it to a
new<00:01:54.180> device<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> town<00:01:55.799> hall<00:01:56.149> for<00:01:57.149> in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
new device which is a town hall for in

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
new device which is a town hall for in
the<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.990> won't<00:01:58.590> allow<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.369> don't
