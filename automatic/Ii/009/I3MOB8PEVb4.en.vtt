00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
recommend you give to go let's launch

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
recommend you give to go let's launch
the<00:00:25.320> app<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.269> actually

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the app here and what it's actually

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
the app here and what it's actually
doing<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.710> camera<00:00:29.220> mode<00:00:29.250> right

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
doing it's actually in camera mode right

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.830 
doing it's actually in camera mode right
now<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> hard<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
now it's kind of hard to see because of

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659 
now it's kind of hard to see because of
obviously<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.470> shooting<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> can

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
obviously I'm shooting this but you can

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.840 
obviously I'm shooting this but you can
see<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.390> camera<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.870> basically<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
see the camera is basically on and you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.510 
see the camera is basically on and you
have<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> bottom<00:00:37.040> three<00:00:38.040> selections

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
have here at the bottom three selections

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.490 
have here at the bottom three selections
one<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.390> click<00:00:39.690> it'll<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.140> take<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
one is to click it'll just take the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.310 
one is to click it'll just take the
photo<00:00:40.770> next<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> timer<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:43.020> which

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
photo next to it is a timer of which

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
photo next to it is a timer of which
it's<00:00:43.530> set<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> 10<00:00:43.950> seconds<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's set to 10 seconds but you can

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
it's set to 10 seconds but you can
actually<00:00:45.120> change<00:00:45.420> any<00:00:45.690> settings<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
actually change any settings but the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
actually change any settings but the
third<00:00:47.100> option<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> coolest<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
third option is really the coolest it is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
third option is really the coolest it is
voice<00:00:49.320> activation<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
voice activation and so what you do is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.069 
voice activation and so what you do is
you<00:00:51.660> tap<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.420> set<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.899> photo

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:15.170 

ready<00:01:01.079> ready<00:01:01.739> click<00:01:06.619> what<00:01:07.970> say<00:01:08.970> cheese

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.770 

and<00:01:16.050> there<00:01:16.260> goes<00:01:16.440> it<00:01:16.650> took<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:16.920> photo<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:18.120> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and there goes it took the photo so that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
and there goes it took the photo so that
is<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.050> how<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:20.130> works<00:01:20.370> so<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
is basically how that works so as you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.970 
is basically how that works so as you
can<00:01:21.180> probably<00:01:21.360> imagine<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.620> lot<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
can probably imagine this has a lot of

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.880 
can probably imagine this has a lot of
useful<00:01:23.730> functionality<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
useful functionality to it right so you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
useful functionality to it right so you
can<00:01:26.130> even<00:01:26.310> switch<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> cameras<00:01:27.270> around<00:01:27.530> down

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
can even switch the cameras around down

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
can even switch the cameras around down
over<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.830> so<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.190> do<00:01:29.250> self-portraits

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
over there so you can do self-portraits

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
over there so you can do self-portraits
where<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.570> tell<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.080> voice<00:01:31.229> activate

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
where you just tell it to voice activate

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
where you just tell it to voice activate
but<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.490> mount<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.150> phone<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
but you can mount the phone on to a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.230 
but you can mount the phone on to a
tripod<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> do<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.910> do<00:01:36.000> group

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
tripod if you do that you can do group

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.730 
tripod if you do that you can do group
shots<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:36.930> yourself<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.410> there<00:01:37.440> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
shots and get yourself in there and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
shots and get yourself in there and
everybody<00:01:38.700> else<00:01:38.790> has<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.060> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> quiet

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
everybody else has to be kind of quiet

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
everybody else has to be kind of quiet
for<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> second<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:40.710> just

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
for a second and then some just

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
for a second and then some just
basically<00:01:41.250> says<00:01:41.490> ready<00:01:41.729> click<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.300> then

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
basically says ready click and then

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
basically says ready click and then
it'll<00:01:42.990> count<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.490> photo<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it'll count down and do the photo so it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.150 
it'll count down and do the photo so it
is<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> cool<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.350> perfect<00:01:46.979> right

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
is kind of cool it is not perfect right

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.090 
is kind of cool it is not perfect right
now<00:01:47.190> for<00:01:47.520> instance<00:01:48.020> flashes<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.710> can't

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
now for instance flashes on but I can't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.320 
now for instance flashes on but I can't
get<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.280> flash<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.640> work<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.030> that's

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
get the flash to work so that's

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.999 
get the flash to work so that's
something<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.690> needs<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.080> addressed<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
something that needs to be addressed so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.999

photo<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.580> let's<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.910> another<00:02:06.030> one

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
photo and then a go let's do another one

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
photo and then a go let's do another one
and<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.869> counts<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.259> again<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> takes<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and it counts down again it takes a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
and it counts down again it takes a
second<00:02:08.459> shot<00:02:08.670> which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.570> pretty

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
second shot which is actually pretty

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.199 
second shot which is actually pretty
useful<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.679> also<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:10.950> some<00:02:11.100> overlays<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
useful you also have some overlays you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.030 
useful you also have some overlays you
can<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> screen<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.739> your<00:02:13.890> rule

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
can do here on the screen is your rule

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.880 
can do here on the screen is your rule
of<00:02:14.190> thirds<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.260> kind<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.470> cool<00:02:16.530> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
of thirds this is kind of cool for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.930 
of thirds this is kind of cool for
placing<00:02:17.280> people<00:02:17.540> into<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> shot<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.940> vice

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
placing people into the shot and vice

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.479 
placing people into the shot and vice
versa<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> other<00:02:21.720> side<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:22.709> those<00:02:23.459> are

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
versa for the other side so those are

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.670 
versa for the other side so those are
those<00:02:23.700> options<00:02:24.180> right<00:02:24.299> there<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.560> also

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
those options right there you can also

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.979 
those options right there you can also
go<00:02:25.890> into<00:02:26.100> settings<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.910> they're<00:02:27.480> actually

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
go into settings and they're actually

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.110 
go into settings and they're actually
quite<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.350> few<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.310> start<00:02:29.640> listening

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
quite a few here there start listening

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.699 
quite a few here there start listening

pressed<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.640> hit<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
pressed so you can actually just hit the

pressed so you can actually just hit the
shutter<00:02:33.120> button<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.840> I'll<00:02:34.019> set<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> voice

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
activation or you can have it take the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 
activation or you can have it take the
picture<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.799> three<00:02:37.950> second<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.880> know
