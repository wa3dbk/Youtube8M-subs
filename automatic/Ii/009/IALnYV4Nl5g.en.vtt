by the color blue let me explain further

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
by the color blue let me explain further
the<00:00:53.940> detectives<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> smallest<00:00:54.989> group<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the detectives are the smallest group of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
the detectives are the smallest group of
players<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:56.100> around<00:00:56.340> ten<00:00:56.520> percent<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
players with around ten percent that I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
players with around ten percent that I
chosen<00:00:57.239> beginning<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> round<00:00:58.140> their<00:00:59.129> job

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
chosen beginning of the round their job

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.470 
chosen beginning of the round their job
is<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> find<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.850> who<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> traitors<00:01:00.329> are

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
is to find out who the traitors are

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
is to find out who the traitors are
there<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.440> several<00:01:01.620> ways<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> doing<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
there are several ways of doing this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
there are several ways of doing this
which<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.969> why<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> find<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> detective

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
which is why I find that the detective

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.100 
which is why I find that the detective
is<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> most<00:01:04.799> versatile<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> theory

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
is the most versatile of the theory

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
is the most versatile of the theory
because<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.470> detectives<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.130> usually<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because of this detectives are usually a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.240 
because of this detectives are usually a
high-profile<00:01:09.060> target<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> traders

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
high-profile target for the traders

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
high-profile target for the traders
detectives<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.369> find<00:01:11.580> information<00:01:11.760> on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
detectives can find information on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.640 
detectives can find information on
corpses<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> normal<00:01:13.020> players<00:01:13.200> cannot<00:01:13.409> see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
corpses the normal players cannot see

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140 
corpses the normal players cannot see
whether<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> information<00:01:14.970> becomes

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
whether this information becomes

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
whether this information becomes
available<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> whole<00:01:15.990> server<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
available to the whole server once a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.340 
available to the whole server once a
detective<00:01:16.950> has<00:01:17.070> looked<00:01:17.310> over<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> corpse
