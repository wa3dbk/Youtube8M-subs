00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
think that's not really the biggest most

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
think that's not really the biggest most
important<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> should<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.970> wiring

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
important thing we should be wiring

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700 
important thing we should be wiring
about<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.689> game<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.080> personally<00:00:31.500> think

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
about this game but I personally think

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.790 
about this game but I personally think
it<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.759> two<00:00:33.030> things<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.800> can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it is there are two things that can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
it is there are two things that can
influence<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.489> game<00:00:35.670> heavy<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.660> two

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
influence this game heavy the two

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
influence this game heavy the two
factors<00:00:37.260> are<00:00:37.469> completely<00:00:37.860> opposite<00:00:38.190> from

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
factors are completely opposite from

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.590 
factors are completely opposite from
each<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> first<00:00:39.120> thing<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.350> CC<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
each other the first thing is if CC to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.030 
each other the first thing is if CC to
include<00:00:42.600> p<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:42.930> characters<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.590> game<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
include p as characters in this game and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.310 
include p as characters in this game and
the<00:00:44.610> second<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.110> not

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the second thing is if they do not

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
the second thing is if they do not
include<00:00:47.219> pts<00:00:48.000> characters<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> game<00:00:48.629> and

you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 

now<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> honestly<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.500> sisters

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
now I honestly do not think that sisters

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.830 
now I honestly do not think that sisters
who<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.220> waste<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.940> time<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.450> PBS

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
who are gonna waste a lot of time on PBS

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660 
who are gonna waste a lot of time on PBS
characters<00:01:16.050> let<00:01:16.560> alone<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:17.040> time<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.520> don't

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
characters let alone any time I don't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
characters let alone any time I don't
think<00:01:17.730> they're<00:01:17.940> even<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.270> focus<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.020> them

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
think they're even gonna focus on them

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
think they're even gonna focus on them
at<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.650> i<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.160> gonna<00:01:20.280> completely

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
at all i think they're gonna completely

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
at all i think they're gonna completely
scratch<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.990> why<00:01:22.230> i<00:01:22.260> made

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
scratch them out and this is why i made

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
scratch them out and this is why i made
it<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:23.010> factors<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.600> keeping<00:01:24.960> pds

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it two factors that are they keeping pds

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
it two factors that are they keeping pds
characters<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.910> if

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
characters are they not because if

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.610 
characters are they not because if
they're<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.390> keeping<00:01:27.630> PDS<00:01:28.170> characters<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
they're not keeping PDS characters just

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.890 
they're not keeping PDS characters just
a<00:01:28.920> whole<00:01:29.220> load<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> stuff<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.720> do

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
a whole load of stuff that they could do

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.390 
a whole load of stuff that they could do
so<00:01:31.080> we're<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.260> start<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> fact<00:01:32.010> 21

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
so we're gonna start off with a fact 21

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.090 
so we're gonna start off with a fact 21
as<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.620> PDS

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
as if there are not gonna be any PDS

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890 
as if there are not gonna be any PDS
characters<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:35.610> i<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.180> very<00:01:36.300> highly

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
characters which i think is very highly

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770 
characters which i think is very highly
likely<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> remember<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.780> storm

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
likely so we got to remember that storm

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.900 
likely so we got to remember that storm
3<00:01:40.020> took<00:01:40.260> three<00:01:40.680> years<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.070> make<00:01:41.430> they're<00:01:41.760> gonna

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
3 took three years to make they're gonna

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.000 
3 took three years to make they're gonna
want<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.300> be<00:01:42.390> focusing<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.080> characters<00:01:43.830> which

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
want to be focusing on characters which

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.890

is why i strongly think that they won't
be<00:02:30.720> wasting<00:02:31.140> time<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.680> PTS<00:02:32.160> characters<00:02:32.790> now

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
hopefully bring up in another video if

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.870 
hopefully bring up in another video if
they<00:02:58.620> are<00:02:58.680> significant<00:02:59.220> enough<00:02:59.280> over<00:02:59.670> here

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
they are significant enough over here

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.110 
they are significant enough over here
anymore<00:03:00.239> news<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.720> storm<00:03:01.320> for<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.850> move<00:03:03.000> on

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
anymore news of storm for now to move on

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.430 
anymore news of storm for now to move on
to<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.269> second<00:03:03.690> factor<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.050> was<00:03:04.170> talking

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
to that second factor that I was talking

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.770 
to that second factor that I was talking
about<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:04.800> they<00:03:04.980> do<00:03:05.040> include<00:03:05.700> pts<00:03:06.209> cactus<00:03:06.660> to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
about if they do include pts cactus to

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.360 
about if they do include pts cactus to
reason<00:03:07.080> why<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.739> it's<00:03:07.890> highly<00:03:08.130> unlikely

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
reason why I think it's highly unlikely

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.759 
reason why I think it's highly unlikely
is<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:09.269> they<00:03:09.510> have<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:10.019> create<00:03:10.290> secret

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
is that they have to create secret

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.740 
is that they have to create secret
factors<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.519> they<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.760> keep<00:03:12.060> sacrificing<00:03:12.269> that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
factors if they do keep sacrificing that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.050 
factors if they do keep sacrificing that
I'm<00:03:12.870> assuming<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:13.470> will<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.830> store<00:03:14.040> for<00:03:14.310> they

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
I'm assuming they will in store for they

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.400 
I'm assuming they will in store for they
have<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.330> create<00:03:15.510> seek<00:03:15.690> effects<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.200> every

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
single PDS character that they missed in

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.030 
single PDS character that they missed in
the<00:03:18.989> old<00:03:19.140> game<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.620> may<00:03:19.709> think<00:03:19.770> that's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the old game and you may think that's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.770 
the old game and you may think that's
not<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.940> lot<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.240> work<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.660> get

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
not a lot but it's a lot of work to get

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.640 
not a lot but it's a lot of work to get
the<00:03:21.900> extra<00:03:22.050> here

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the extra here

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.119 
the extra here
the<00:03:23.269> secret<00:03:24.269> factors<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.590> new<00:03:25.709> mechanics

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
the secret factors all the new mechanics

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.860 
the secret factors all the new mechanics
that<00:03:26.189> all<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.790> caches<00:03:26.939> could<00:03:27.299> do<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.780> they

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that all the caches could do and they

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.750 
that all the caches could do and they
can<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:28.349> pour<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.769> from<00:03:28.920> generations<00:03:29.549> and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
can just pour it from generations and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.149 
can just pour it from generations and
think<00:03:29.970> all<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.659> gonna<00:03:30.810> fix<00:03:31.140> but<00:03:31.920> if

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
think all that's it's gonna fix but if

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.910 
think all that's it's gonna fix but if
they<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.370> do<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:33.140> I'm<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.319> gonna<00:03:34.439> be<00:03:34.590> negative

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
they do do it I'm not gonna be negative

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.350 
they do do it I'm not gonna be negative
all<00:03:35.099> right<00:03:35.220> let's<00:03:35.430> try<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.909> positive<00:03:36.269> with

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
this they do they could bring up

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.809 
this they do they could bring up
potential<00:03:38.099> characters<00:03:38.370> such<00:03:38.489> as<00:03:38.549> kick

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
age Konohamaru who I know a lot about

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.789 
age Konohamaru who I know a lot about
people<00:03:51.090> wanted<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.959> be<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.319> game<00:03:52.530> so

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
people wanted to be in this game so

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.680 
people wanted to be in this game so
possibly<00:03:53.459> they<00:03:53.640> could<00:03:53.819> do<00:03:53.939> that<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.359> just

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
possibly they could do that to I just

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.059 
possibly they could do that to I just
think<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:54.989> highly<00:03:55.170> unlikely<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.739> me<00:03:55.920> know

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
think it's highly unlikely I me know

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.410 
think it's highly unlikely I me know
what<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> think<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.609> comment<00:03:57.030> box<00:03:57.060> I

would also like Connor harmoo he's also

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.729 
would also like Connor harmoo he's also

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
in shippuden as well and he goes both

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.309 
in shippuden as well and he goes both
ways<00:04:01.980> he<00:04:02.159> could<00:04:02.280> also<00:04:02.489> be<00:04:02.819> in<00:04:03.150> without<00:04:04.049> having

ways he could also be in without having

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.319
