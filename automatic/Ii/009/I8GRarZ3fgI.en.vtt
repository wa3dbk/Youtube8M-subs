me and asking me you know which
particular<00:00:57.750> rail<00:00:58.230> system<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.219> weapon

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
particular rail system is on this weapon

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
particular rail system is on this weapon
system<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.079> weapon<00:01:01.379> system<00:01:01.620> we

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
system you know which weapon system we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
system you know which weapon system we
should<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.980> doing<00:01:02.809> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> Army<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
should be doing in the Army there's a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
should be doing in the Army there's a
lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> variation<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.299> know

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
lot of variation out there and I know

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.330 
lot of variation out there and I know
enough<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> point<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
enough about them to point out the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
enough about them to point out the
differences<00:01:08.729> between<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
differences between them so the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.690 
differences between them so the
ballistics<00:01:10.710> simulations<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.369> game<00:01:11.549> are

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
ballistics simulations in the game are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
ballistics simulations in the game are
very<00:01:11.909> accurate<00:01:12.450> um<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> data<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> we've

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
very accurate um the the data that we've

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
very accurate um the the data that we've
required<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> real<00:01:14.880> world<00:01:15.090> data<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
required is real world data and not to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
required is real world data and not to
mention<00:01:16.580> yeah<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.820> deed<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.630> experience

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
mention yeah the deed the experience

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
mention yeah the deed the experience
from<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> designers<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> actually<00:01:20.790> fire

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
from the designers if you actually fire

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
from the designers if you actually fire
the<00:01:21.119> weapon<00:01:21.570> systems<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.229> yeah<00:01:22.409> smes<00:01:23.009> telling

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the weapon systems and yeah smes telling

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
the weapon systems and yeah smes telling
us<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> should<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.909> instant<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
us how it should be instant like that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.109 
us how it should be instant like that
this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> our<00:01:25.830> rubber<00:01:26.040> ducks<00:01:26.340> it's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this is one of our rubber ducks it's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
this is one of our rubber ducks it's
replicating<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.780> m4<00:01:28.770> mws<00:01:29.360> basically<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.619> it's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
replicating a m4 mws basically the it's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.160 
replicating a m4 mws basically the it's
just<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> rubber<00:01:32.430> mold<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
just a rubber mold of the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.649 
just a rubber mold of the
actual<00:01:33.409> weapon<00:01:33.710> system<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:35.210> reason<00:01:35.450> why<00:01:35.540> we

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
actual weapon system the reason why we

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.340 
actual weapon system the reason why we
have<00:01:35.810> these<00:01:35.930> at<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.170> office<00:01:36.590> is<00:01:37.150> it's<00:01:38.350> it's

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
have these at the office is it's it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.320 
have these at the office is it's it's
great<00:01:39.619> for<00:01:39.830> hours<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.250> actually<00:01:40.369> have<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.000> be

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
great for hours to actually have the be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.850 
great for hours to actually have the be
able<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.570> put<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.720> prop<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.229> their<00:01:42.380> hand<00:01:42.619> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
able to put the prop in their hand and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.830 
able to put the prop in their hand and
see<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.189> move<00:01:43.700> around<00:01:43.970> be<00:01:44.299> able<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.540> see<00:01:44.630> three

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
see it move around be able to see three

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.690 
see it move around be able to see three
dimensionally<00:01:45.470> look<00:01:45.770> at<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.009> rail<00:01:46.189> system

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
dimensionally look at the rail system

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.450 
dimensionally look at the rail system
how<00:01:47.030> everything<00:01:47.360> works<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:49.159> one<00:01:49.340> is

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
how everything works this one is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.070 
how everything works this one is
non-functional<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.420> doesn't<00:01:50.780> have<00:01:50.930> any

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
non-functional it doesn't have any

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.240 
non-functional it doesn't have any
moving<00:01:51.259> parts<00:01:51.380> or<00:01:51.710> anything<00:01:51.890> like<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.009> we

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
moving parts or anything like that we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.740 
moving parts or anything like that we
have<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.399> few<00:01:52.640> models<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.119> do<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.600> that's

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
have a few models that do and that's

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.660 
have a few models that do and that's
that's<00:01:54.049> great<00:01:54.140> for<00:01:54.500> animation<00:01:55.159> purposes

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that's great for animation purposes

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.950 
that's great for animation purposes
motion<00:01:56.479> capture<00:01:56.630> sound<00:01:57.350> capture<00:01:58.960> they're
