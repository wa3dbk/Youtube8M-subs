00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.370
 we will introduce our students but 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.930
 about one year old and it's 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.530
 a creole dog because it's a dog 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.379
 rescued from the street let's look at everything 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.600
 the process from start to finish how are we going 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.270
 to make rocco learn to walk 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.340
 our side and that we can enjoy 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 a nice walk with him 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.360
 let's talk now about the materials 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.229
 necessary for this class we are going to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.640
 need a device like this that I'm going 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.640
 to add to the camera that is called 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.550
 clicker is a resonance box that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.120
 generates this noise 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.030
 and that its function will be to associate the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 noise at the delivery of the prize we are going to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.310
 need a loop to control 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 our dog one brought one brings and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.250
 it can be in drowning it can be a deadline 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.800
 fixed 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.610
 and we're going to need bits of food 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.190
 roughly the size of a nail such 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 as you can see here those 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.320
 chunks can be chicken can be 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.330
 dehydrated liver the only thing that 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.750
 I recommend not to use is the food 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.090
 concentrated that we give to the dog because 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
 normally it 's dry food has to 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.760
 chew it and that makes us lose 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.680
 enough time and later we will see 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.150
 why it becomes a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.150
 interference for learning 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.770
 now we go with the class step to 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.070
 what 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.560
 learns to walk and is called associating or 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.800
 load the click on what we are going to do 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.500
 when it allows it is 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.270
 the association connect in your brain the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.640
 sound that produces the soundboard 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.430
 with the delivery of the food then 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.000
 let's apply to the time we're going to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.000
 give food 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.580
 we wait for him to stop playing with the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 rope and we deliver a piece of 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.920
 community for every time we usually the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.920
 clicker 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.360
 we can also deliver it on the ground 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.840
 maybe this will take us several sessions of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.489
 I work three or four sessions until 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.500
 our dog connect the two things 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.500
 sound and food delivery 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.810
 how are we going to find out if the town 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.670
 has thus recognizes that the sound is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.220
 what announces the delivery of the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.319
 we will identify it because 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.989
 when we generate the sound the dog 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.120
 immediately going to look for us going to 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.459
 raise your head will you look at us or will you 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
 change the expression on your face is going to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.269
 move the ears forward 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.500
 as I told you earlier this can 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.500
 I take several classes 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.510
 if we do not associate it we still follow 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.510
 delivering the prize
