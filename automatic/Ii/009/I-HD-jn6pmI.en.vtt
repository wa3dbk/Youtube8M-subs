use my iphone 5s silver to record this
video<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.210> could<00:01:10.450> show<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.800> looks

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
video I could show you that it looks

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.510 
video I could show you that it looks
exactly<00:01:12.580> as<00:01:12.910> this<00:01:13.300> on<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.899> front<00:01:14.250> except<00:01:15.250> for

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
exactly as this on the front except for

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.139 
exactly as this on the front except for
my<00:01:16.300> iphone<00:01:16.600> 5s<00:01:16.990> has<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.410> touch<00:01:17.979> ID<00:01:18.369> button

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
my iphone 5s has a touch ID button

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.999 
my iphone 5s has a touch ID button
instead<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:20.490> Samson<00:01:21.490> bottom<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.649> this<00:01:23.649> is

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
instead of a Samson bottom so this is

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.210 
instead of a Samson bottom so this is
almost<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.210> clone<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.050> iphone<00:01:26.380> 5s<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:26.979> think

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
almost a clone of the iphone 5s I think

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.990 
almost a clone of the iphone 5s I think
and<00:01:28.030> Santa<00:01:28.660> also<00:01:28.869> makes<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.950> smaller<00:01:30.550> than

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
and Santa also makes it smaller than

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.380 
and Santa also makes it smaller than
their<00:01:31.330> other<00:01:31.539> phones<00:01:32.140> now<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.800> will<00:01:33.009> be<00:01:33.390> 4.7

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
their other phones now it will be 4.7

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.650 
their other phones now it will be 4.7
inch<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.160> exactly<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.420> room

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
inch and that it's exactly as the room

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.090 
inch and that it's exactly as the room
what<00:01:37.899> iphone<00:01:38.289> 6<00:01:38.950> will<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.910> same<00:01:40.149> size<00:01:40.420> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100

they can buy the 4.7 inch Galaxy alpha
instead<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.399> still<00:02:09.759> has<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> terrible<00:02:10.750> backside

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
instead it still has a terrible backside

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.400 
instead it still has a terrible backside
though<00:02:11.650> still<00:02:12.430> plastic<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:14.140> looks

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
though still plastic so it looks

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.569 
though still plastic so it looks
terrible<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:15.190> lot<00:02:15.579> more<00:02:16.299> terrible<00:02:16.750> than<00:02:16.900> their

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
terrible at lot more terrible than their

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.000 
terrible at lot more terrible than their
hypothesis<00:02:18.579> so<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:20.110> looks<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
hypothesis so it looks like all the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.610 
hypothesis so it looks like all the
other<00:02:21.250> hundreds<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.299> galaxy<00:02:22.959> phones<00:02:23.260> that

plastic backside still same form and the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
plastic backside still same form and the
only<00:02:31.660> difference<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.190> band<00:02:33.489> around

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
only difference is that the band around

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.560 
only difference is that the band around
the<00:02:34.450> phone<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.320> edges<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.269> the
