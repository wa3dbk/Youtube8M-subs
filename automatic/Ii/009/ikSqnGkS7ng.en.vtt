 its early to say the right decisions 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.550
 throughout then again before introduction we 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
 congratulations to the whole country basically 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 whose gold medal was given in 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.109
 team tournament 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.989
 but one thing whole against second 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.910
 third places in combo in team tournament 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.580
 a typo starts various competitions 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.920
 of course we all waited for a hard fight and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 Of course the quality of skating wrenched the keys to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.280
 it keep an eye on the Olympics 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 Straight look match you care 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.820
 in the company boxer also manifest itself 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.470
 I just why I still say because 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 even before the start of the Olympiad it may even be 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.909
 a few weeks before there were such 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 forecasts that now see him Plushenko 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.340
 take off as a result of the competition wait 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.110
 something like this is the expected moment 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.500
 why I expected not to take it off and because 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.020
 what 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.020
 relying on his statement after point 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.299
 trucks when he said my words to this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 his words are borrowed cook myself 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.110
 only in teams but not in street 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.290
 I understand that now absolutely 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.369
 new generation of figure skaters and and only in 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.000
 male sport 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.680
 there correctly young guys who have 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.009
 which more they can already open in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 friend yan higher level this 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.259
 understood and initially but we just drank this 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.350
 new discipline team tournament where u 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.820
 of our country and we should 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.760
 dark headsets with all those figurines 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.100
 that showed themselves well and caused 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 first gold to us now gold oh how 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.070
 we must be all loops and we will finish a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 control over kiqiqi jubilee there 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.050
 straw and i created this team which 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.160
 is still working at the moment on 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.650
 Krasnoyarsk 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.900
 and today when we pass on silk straight 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.260
 ran to the TV screens for our 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.170
 what kind 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.690
 played against lamination right before 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.180
 With an exit on lost here 10 already 20 and so 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.260
 Further, of course, we still battles 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.170
 who turn away 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 On the Olympus Priori, of course, I'm not lying 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.580
 on the most important thing to medal standings 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.240
 while tea or to this and some as 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.760
 can be higher 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.480
 now you know the voices that it is insulting for 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.740
 a sweater for a young figure skater if 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.870
 drove supposedly he would have a chance and so 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.150
 Plushenko withdrew and in general we remained 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.360
 with virtually no short program 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.910
 masculine i think these are the questions to ask 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.450
 the team that is and works 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.970
 The same not the key keeper yes it is visible that young 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.700
 the decision guy needs to quickly on your 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.660
 child in the team and more about 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 team tournament we understand that we 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 your street and ice dancing drone 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.480
 will draw a short program 3 place in 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.310
 free program you now they 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.700
 read olympic champions therefore 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.770
 this team tournament he lowers 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.430
 value is generally 2 non-Olympic 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.550
 the champion 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.460
 Here a little bit in this plan is insulting but 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.950
 private tournaments or the glad and rejoice 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.380
 yesterday's doubles skating win also 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.140
 cerebro guys it is very important 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.350
 performed at all figure skating I'm glad 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.240
 that the outcome of the year bot and forgot how and 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.830
 another theater 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.570
 brings a consistently medal for our 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.060
 countries are the spirits of the tank front very 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.590
 I hope for a young female 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.880
 legal such Polyansky whether I will return 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.460
 and probably found that delivers 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.730
 other brands only on her features 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.660
 execution 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.180
 countries program still on artistry 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.900
 glasses and decent people very lining not 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.840
 so we hope that one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.710
 midori for our thanks with us on 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.940
