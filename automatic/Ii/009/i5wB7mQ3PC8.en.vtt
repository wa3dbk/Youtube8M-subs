00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.359
 could work together if you look 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.789

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.810
 samsung a bit of a relationship and thus 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679
 trying to copy apple 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.410

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.950

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.950
