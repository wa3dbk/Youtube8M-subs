00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
only thing that'll be different from my

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.830 
only thing that'll be different from my
-<00:01:24.330> yours

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
- yours

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.580 
- yours
is<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.270> whatever<00:01:27.900> map<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
is that this will be whatever map you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.890 
is that this will be whatever map you
make<00:01:29.130> changing<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.720> might<00:01:30.869> be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
make changing it to and there might be

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580 
make changing it to and there might be
several<00:01:32.119> copies<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:34.049> different

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
several copies of this with different

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.450 
several copies of this with different
tags<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.560> need<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
tags here so all you need to do and this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100 
tags here so all you need to do and this
is<00:01:38.520> probably<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> most<00:01:39.119> complicated<00:01:39.420> step<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is probably the most complicated step to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
is probably the most complicated step to
be<00:01:40.170> honest<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:41.340> copy<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> these<00:01:42.659> things

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
be honest just copy one of these things

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.399 
be honest just copy one of these things
from<00:01:43.590> mer<00:01:44.130> type<00:01:44.490> equals<00:01:44.970> GPM<00:01:45.780> underscore

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
whatever to - in mode so just copy one

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.670 
whatever to - in mode so just copy one
of<00:01:50.130> those<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:52.310> after<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.759> last<00:01:54.530> one<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
of those and after the very last one of

of those and after the very last one of
these

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
these

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
these
underscores<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.420> slash<00:01:58.079> mode<00:01:58.549> do<00:01:59.549> enter<00:01:59.969> tab

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
underscores the slash mode do enter tab

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.230 
underscores the slash mode do enter tab
tab<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.299> Corey<00:02:03.299> paste

tab and Corey paste

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.059 
tab and Corey paste
and<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:06.580> after<00:02:06.790> you've<00:02:07.030> done<00:02:07.150> man<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.740> delete

CTF and make it tooth which stands for
tutorial<00:02:13.000> obviously<00:02:13.709> now<00:02:14.709> I'm<00:02:14.920> keep<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> mind

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
tutorial obviously now I'm keep in mind

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000 
tutorial obviously now I'm keep in mind
GPM<00:02:16.360> underscore<00:02:16.900> CTF<00:02:17.319> means<00:02:17.560> capture<00:02:17.920> the

GPM underscore CTF means capture the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.140 
GPM underscore CTF means capture the
flag<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.680> another<00:02:20.680> one<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.920> these<00:02:21.220> may

it to My Documents and go to the place
you<00:03:21.880> extracted<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:24.610> might<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:24.790> find

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you extracted it to you might not find

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.640 
you extracted it to you might not find
it<00:03:25.329> because<00:03:25.480> it'll<00:03:25.840> actually<00:03:25.900> make<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.260> folder

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it because it'll actually make a folder

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.160 
it because it'll actually make a folder
called<00:03:27.100> game<00:03:27.489> modes<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:28.660> go<00:03:28.780> into<00:03:28.900> game

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
called game modes so just go into game

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.580 
called game modes so just go into game
roads<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.060> you'll<00:03:31.060> see<00:03:31.239> GPM<00:03:31.720> underscore<00:03:32.170> CTF

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
roads and you'll see GPM underscore CTF
so<00:03:32.769> just<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.070> rename<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:36.060> two<00:03:37.890> such<00:03:38.890> just

so just to rename that to two such just
rename<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.200> even<00:03:41.860> if<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.160> says<00:03:42.250> GPM

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670

underscore<00:03:43.239> JH<00:03:43.269> TDM<00:03:44.400> put<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> back<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.850> this

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
underscore JH TDM put it back in this

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.810 
underscore JH TDM put it back in this
folder<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:48.329> close<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:50.549> once<00:03:51.549> you've<00:03:51.670> done

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
that one of the last steps is go back to

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.590 
that one of the last steps is go back to
your<00:03:57.510> modding<00:03:58.510> folder<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> EA<00:04:00.549> games<00:04:00.880> benefit

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.469 
would not type in Riverside Russia you
would<00:05:00.830> type<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.160> heat<00:05:01.430> because<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.330> is<00:05:02.449> a

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
would type in heat because that is a

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:02.920 
would type in heat because that is a
code<00:05:02.720> name

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
code name

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.200 
code name
so<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:04.250> I'll<00:05:04.460> save<00:05:06.280> then<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.490> very<00:05:07.820> last<00:05:07.910> thing

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
that's it you're done so let's test it

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.620 
that's it you're done so let's test it
up<00:05:27.349> to<00:05:27.530> prove<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.860> works<00:05:31.210> keep<00:05:32.210> in<00:05:32.330> mind<00:05:32.599> guys

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
up to prove that works keep in mind guys

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.990 
up to prove that works keep in mind guys
this<00:05:33.050> only<00:05:33.169> works<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:33.680> tutorial<00:05:34.010> mode<00:05:34.340> there

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
this only works in tutorial mode there

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.850 
this only works in tutorial mode there
will<00:05:35.120> not<00:05:35.270> be<00:05:35.300> any<00:05:35.840> applications<00:05:36.530> for<00:05:36.710> this

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
will not be any applications for this

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.940 
will not be any applications for this

more<00:05:40.160> tutorials<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:40.940> make<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:43.780> there's<00:05:44.780> no

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
more tutorials that I make so there's no

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.770 
more tutorials that I make so there's no
point<00:05:45.110> attempting<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:46.240> try<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.450> multiplayer

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
point attempting to try and multiplayer

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.870 
point attempting to try and multiplayer
as<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.200> just<00:05:48.380> be<00:05:48.560> kicked<00:05:48.800> back<00:05:49.430> don't<00:05:49.639> press

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
as you just be kicked back don't press

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:15.820 
as you just be kicked back don't press
them

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.430 

so<00:06:16.430> once<00:06:16.879> I'm<00:06:17.060> in<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.360> main<00:06:17.690> interface<00:06:17.990> I'll

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
so once I'm in the main interface I'll

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.270 
so once I'm in the main interface I'll
go<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.650> game<00:06:18.979> mode<00:06:19.270> tutorial<00:06:20.270> and<00:06:21.069> you<00:06:22.069> should

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
go to game mode tutorial and you should

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.740 
go to game mode tutorial and you should
see<00:06:22.460> map<00:06:22.729> lunar<00:06:23.449> landing<00:06:24.430> and<00:06:25.509> that's<00:06:26.509> pretty

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
see map lunar landing and that's pretty

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:58.390 
see map lunar landing and that's pretty
much<00:06:26.870> it<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.349> just<00:06:27.770> go<00:06:28.039> into<00:06:28.159> that<00:06:28.340> map

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.909 

so<00:06:59.210> obvious<00:06:59.690> I'm<00:06:59.840> in<00:07:00.020> tutorial<00:07:00.470> mode<00:07:00.590> because

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
so obvious I'm in tutorial mode because

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:08.260 
so obvious I'm in tutorial mode because
it<00:07:01.070> says<00:07:01.280> current<00:07:04.540> and<00:07:05.540> there<00:07:06.050> you<00:07:06.139> go<00:07:06.320> I<00:07:07.270> am

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
it says current and there you go I am

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.020 
it says current and there you go I am
doing<00:07:08.930> a<00:07:08.990> landing<00:07:09.290> into<00:07:09.440> sort<00:07:09.770> of<00:07:09.919> like<00:07:10.130> so

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
doing a landing into sort of like so

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.960 
doing a landing into sort of like so
that's<00:07:11.419> pretty<00:07:11.690> much<00:07:11.780> it<00:07:11.900> I<00:07:12.350> can<00:07:12.650> do<00:07:13.639> anything

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
that's pretty much it I can do anything

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.409 
that's pretty much it I can do anything
as<00:07:14.240> usual<00:07:14.630> as<00:07:14.900> if<00:07:15.410> I<00:07:15.500> want<00:07:15.710> to<00:07:15.889> total<00:07:16.250> and<00:07:16.460> it's

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
as usual as if I want to total and it's

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.800 
as usual as if I want to total and it's
very<00:07:17.630> useful<00:07:18.020> for<00:07:18.050> filming<00:07:18.560> videos<00:07:18.919> obviously

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810
