90<00:01:47.340> minutes<00:01:47.659> right<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
90 minutes right here I think I kind of

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.520 
90 minutes right here I think I kind of
lost<00:01:50.310> track<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.659> after<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.259> throw

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lost track of time but after this throw

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.630 
lost track of time but after this throw
and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.799> realize<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.610> past<00:01:53.880> 20<00:01:54.240> minutes

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
and I realize that it's past 20 minutes

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.209
