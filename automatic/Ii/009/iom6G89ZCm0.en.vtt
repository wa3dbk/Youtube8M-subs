00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.229
 how about friends mister being normally three goals another let's ask god 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.530
 taking advantage of the occasion where they installed 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.039
 economic of the most famous stress 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.419
 direct current 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.769
 We can observe 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 what is the effect they produce from light 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:17.740
 We're seeing 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 same tuning 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.390
 in this way the agent to lie 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.369
 the Chinese also happened to me 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.229
 Nowadays, the ballasts are so cheap and so bad 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.050
 and what they do is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 the output of international catch currents came out 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 Recently 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.060
 we are armament 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.310
 we must learn not to be edible intention to return 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 there is no regulation 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 they are already direct hit no longer follows the chile ballasters is also a matter 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.670
 it is a good indicator when the bad ones are bad 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 they always understood 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.330
 how does an english seaman pouler make this son 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 copar even in the units 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.130
 we recorded observing the wall 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.120
 where can it be 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 much more notorious of the un 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 how it looks 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.240
 the camera is harder to detect even in real life it's world 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.130
 the answer is 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 as part of this task 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.599
 I hope this friend serves him something 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.289
 more than anything to be able to differentiate 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.719
 a ballast to be like that 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.079
 another bad luck is reduced 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.399
 they are flooding the market 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:29.429
 for your attention friends 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.970
 thank you very much and then the south end 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.959
 the comparative 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.319
 of one against the other more complete 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.319
 since then and crazy 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.340
