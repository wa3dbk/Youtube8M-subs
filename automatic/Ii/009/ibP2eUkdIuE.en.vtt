00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
whatever it was really great up and I've

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
whatever it was really great up and I've
used<00:01:13.590> other<00:01:13.799> natural<00:01:14.340> ones<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.060> by

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
used other natural ones and this is by

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
used other natural ones and this is by
far<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.780> favorite<00:01:16.229> there's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> couple<00:01:16.950> reasons

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
far my favorite there's a couple reasons

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
far my favorite there's a couple reasons
one<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.330> obviously<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.869> because

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
one the first one obviously is because

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
one the first one obviously is because
it<00:01:19.229> works<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.280> hard<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> find

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it works you know it's hard to find

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
it works you know it's hard to find
things<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.600> anything<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.140> life<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.680> hard<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
things in anything in life it's hard to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
things in anything in life it's hard to
find<00:01:23.100> things<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> work<00:01:23.580> especially<00:01:24.299> good<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
find things that work especially good I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.999 
find things that work especially good I
mean<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.869> all-natural<00:01:25.170> products<00:01:25.890> 100%

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
mean at all-natural products 100%

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
mean at all-natural products 100%
organic<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.390> mean<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
organic you know what I mean like no I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
organic you know what I mean like no I
think<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> natural<00:01:28.829> products<00:01:29.100> work<00:01:29.250> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
think a lot of natural products work but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.830 
think a lot of natural products work but
when<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> talk<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.150> something<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
when you talk about something that is

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800 
when you talk about something that is
essentially<00:01:31.320> unnatural<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:33.060> keeping

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
essentially unnatural like like keeping

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
essentially unnatural like like keeping
bugs<00:01:34.170> away<00:01:34.439> whatever<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bugs away whatever but it's you you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
bugs away whatever but it's you you
question<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.259> those<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.130> things

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
question and do those are the two things

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
question and do those are the two things
yeah<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> feel<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.600> always<00:01:39.780> wondering

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
yeah I feel like I'm always wondering

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.499 
yeah I feel like I'm always wondering
does<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.890> work<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.090> friends

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
does it really work and have my friends
