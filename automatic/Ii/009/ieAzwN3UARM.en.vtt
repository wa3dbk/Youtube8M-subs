their evolved form in terms of speed
either<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.430> there<00:00:23.609> has<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.359> reason

either but there has to be some reason
for<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.830> slow<00:00:26.160> speed<00:00:26.640> but

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for this it's not just slow speed but

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.450 
for this it's not just slow speed but
slowing<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> brain<00:00:27.960> too<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.279> they

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
slowing the brain too but then as they

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.769 
slowing the brain too but then as they
evolve<00:00:29.820> they<00:00:30.060> become<00:00:30.449> more<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.720> more

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
evolve they become more and more

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
evolve they become more and more
