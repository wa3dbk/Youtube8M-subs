00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.090
 is again fourcade at the pc did the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.889
 we will mists today times of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.219
 So, look at pandaria world of warcraft 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 and yes it is already here that is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.789
 Mr Panda was our benchmark 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.529
 character for the wow addon and yes the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 vga resolution 4096 x 2160 active again 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 and as you can see you can practically see 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 No more cards on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 looking for the gentleman on this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.880
 you can see that the pixels are very small 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 and thanks to the eightfold eightfold 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.500
 will be possible there is still everything 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.910
 actually no steps are to be seen 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.790
 the menu is then quite fluid 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 with 370 ps 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.610
 but then on the real map no more 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610
 so completely 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.040
 that is still the city area from others 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:02.150
 So if you come to create then 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.070
 she out and yes an overclocked 77 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 with 1002 megahertz at least here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.920
 30 fps with this link 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.390
 vga resolution are active that is 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.320
 By the way, on our benchmark 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 for the wow I was particularly spectacular 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 but here at least through the whole 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.710
 mist we say the dung of pandaria 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.630
 against the fts at least neat us 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.580
 can show our lipkin world the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.310
 we used that back then 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.270
 our former benchmarking and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 shown that's for the howling 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.340
 fjord that's one of those pretty ones 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:56.860
 worlds here consists of a flight of s 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.209
 t box from best ford wants was there and up 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.610
 arrive today we fly through one 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.049
 beautiful swallows various woods and such 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.490
 And this world is always growing 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.160
 one of the foremost in wow the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.989
 current worlds are not 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 full handsome looks namely 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.930
 that he has many polygons in the picture 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.160
 what is also noticeable is as I said 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.560
 pixel you can not see any more 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.239
 that's really super smooth 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.380
 only vegetation made of textures 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.269
 does not exist before the multiple 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.799
 smoothed out but there was the hockey 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.670
 monitor has a very high pixel density 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.670
 it can get over that 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.640
 so the big sound is really nice 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 to the validity 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.010
 we have a screen diagonal of 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.170
 36 inches 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.709
 that is also more than the usual pc 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.359
 monitor offers if you have the real ones 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.630
 Fourcade displays come out that would be 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.250
 First of all, be the TV 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.320
 johann 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.390
 the fun will be even bigger 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.210
 frame rate of between 25 and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.040
 By the way, the memory usage is 30 fps 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.190
 pretty cute as you need yourself 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.800
 the morning with scarcely 16 from the 6 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.620
 gigabyte reaches every commercial 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.570
 graphics card and you can still man 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 could also say that a common gtx 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.940
 680 or 77 is enough for wow in hockey 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.870
 play that is nice or 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.950
 actually that this is going to fly off here 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.120
 80 seconds to the west and yes yes 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.120
 We do not want to continue that
