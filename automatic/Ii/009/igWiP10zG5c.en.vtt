00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
of my roles was asked to figure out how

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.420 
of my roles was asked to figure out how
to<00:00:38.190> control<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:40.340> advertisements<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
political campaign messages that would

political campaign messages that would
go<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.649> through<00:00:44.399> web-based<00:00:45.360> applications

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
go out through web-based applications

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
go out through web-based applications
and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.370> decided<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.030> would<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and I decided that what i would do is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.959 
and I decided that what i would do is
apply<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:49.320> framework<00:00:50.280> policy

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
apply the same framework policy

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
apply the same framework policy
framework<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.780> online<00:00:52.590> advertisement<00:00:53.250> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
framework to online advertisement as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
framework to online advertisement as
we'd<00:00:53.550> always<00:00:53.820> done<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.329> offline

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
we'd always done for offline

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
we'd always done for offline
advertisements<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.739> quickly<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.789> ran<00:00:56.969> into<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
advertisements and quickly we ran into a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
advertisements and quickly we ran into a
number<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> problems<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> including

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
number of problems with that including

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
number of problems with that including
one<00:00:59.879> candidate<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> shadow<00:01:00.989> website

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
one candidate had a shadow website

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.880 
one candidate had a shadow website
created<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:02.969> her<00:01:03.329> by<00:01:03.510> someone<00:01:03.899> else<00:01:04.140> where

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
created not by her by someone else where

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.700 
created not by her by someone else where
it<00:01:05.339> appeared<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.000> she<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.390> maligning<00:01:06.840> one

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it appeared that she was maligning one

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
it appeared that she was maligning one
of<00:01:07.830> her<00:01:07.979> competitive<00:01:08.490> candidates<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> at

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of her competitive candidates and so at

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
of her competitive candidates and so at
that<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.280> became<00:01:11.460> fairly<00:01:12.000> interested<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that point I became fairly interested in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.010 
that point I became fairly interested in
the<00:01:13.530> ways<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.610> people<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:15.390> control<00:01:15.780> both

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the ways that people could control both

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
the ways that people could control both
their<00:01:16.229> own<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> other<00:01:16.740> people's<00:01:16.830> information

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
their own and other people's information

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
their own and other people's information
online<00:01:18.140> there's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.320> number<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> questions

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
online there's a number of questions

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
online there's a number of questions
that<00:01:20.670> arise<00:01:21.060> both<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.840> legal<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> policy

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that arise both from a legal and policy

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.679 
that arise both from a legal and policy
perspective<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.210> interested<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
perspective which I was interested in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.600 
perspective which I was interested in
from<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.110> undergrad<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.520> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
from my undergrad and from a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
from my undergrad and from a
sociological<00:01:26.970> perspective<00:01:27.960> including

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sociological perspective including

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
sociological perspective including
issues<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.040> identity<00:01:29.220> formation<00:01:29.880> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
issues of identity formation and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.469 
issues of identity formation and
identity<00:01:30.750> control<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.740> thought<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
identity control and I thought that

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
identity control and I thought that
communication<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.680> great<00:01:34.860> place

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
communication was a really great place

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
communication was a really great place
to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.520> able<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> combine<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> those

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to be able to combine some of those

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
to be able to combine some of those
things<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.220> were<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> number<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.640> things

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
things so there were a number of things

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
things so there were a number of things
that<00:01:39.180> drew<00:01:39.509> me<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> annenberg<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.530> particular

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that drew me to annenberg in particular

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.560 
that drew me to annenberg in particular
when<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> decided<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.909> wanted<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
when I decided that I wanted to do a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.100 
when I decided that I wanted to do a
doctoral<00:01:43.020> degree<00:01:43.189> one<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.060> breadth<00:01:45.869> of

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
doctoral degree one was the breadth of

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830 
doctoral degree one was the breadth of
focus<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> faculty<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.630> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
focus that the faculty have at this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.499 
focus that the faculty have at this
school<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.590> I've<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.000> able<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
school so I've really been able to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.560 
school so I've really been able to
combined<00:01:52.079> an<00:01:52.470> interest<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.570> institutions

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
combined an interest in institutions

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.310 
combined an interest in institutions
culture<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.470> history<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.700> ask<00:01:57.060> questions<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
culture and history to ask questions in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
culture and history to ask questions in
a<00:01:58.439> number<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> different<00:01:59.070> ways<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.240> ways

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
a number of different ways and the ways

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
a number of different ways and the ways
that<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> faculty<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.979> helped<00:02:02.250> me

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that the faculty here have helped me

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
address my own research questions I

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
address my own research questions I
think<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.100> broadened<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.659> scope<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
think have really broadened the scope of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
think have really broadened the scope of
the<00:02:07.290> research<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.979> able<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:10.110> well

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the research that I'm able to do as well

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.930 
the research that I'm able to do as well
because<00:02:11.009> I'm<00:02:11.160> interested<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.360> quest

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
because I'm interested in quest

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300
