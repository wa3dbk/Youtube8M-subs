00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello to all so the income are 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.299
 aggregated to the small but I have so he 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.979
 should finally arrive in france the month 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.299
 next 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.650
 monkey jo design level it's pretty 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.450
 square it is a bit like a galaxy 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.309
 s2 actually it offers a grip 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.299
 pretty nice with a weight of 145 g 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.470
 most reasonable 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.580
 if we had to do a little tour of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.019
 owner we will find on the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.820
 left slice a control button the 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.990
 volume which will also act as 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 shutter release for the camera 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 on the right we will find the button 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 feeding that will also allow 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 to get out of sleep on the top we go 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
 find a jack 3.5 is below 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 finally the micro usb a small microphone 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.010
 in the back we will find an apn of 3 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 megapixels so and rather banal we're going 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.680
 also note that lg did the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.790
 same choice as most 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 builders for their top models 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.430
 range which therefore a unibody design so there 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.480
 the back shell is not not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.750
 removable and the sim card gets itself in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.640
 a small slot that requires an object 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 pointed for to bring it back to the level 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 of ignition so we will fall back on a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.460
 screensaver that is not a screen 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.339
 classics on android me who am 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 indeed made their android 4.0 been 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.340
 with an overlay so lg that offers 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.020
 and that's for example a lot of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 shortcuts at the bottom of the screen up to 4 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.119
 parametric obviously just like 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.829
 the clock that is configurable one can 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 choose to display calendar these 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.310
 appointment measure of things when we go 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.090
 unlock it have a bull effect 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.189
 pretty friendly 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.869
 we are given a notification that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 appears roughly on the screen and which 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.799
 allows to read the sms in room is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.770
 also rather practical so the big 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.710
 strong point of this lightweight is obviously 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 like a samsung galaxy s traitor the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 overlay of the constructor so here it's 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 an overlay lg that offers particular 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.310
 but as we already know about on the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 4 x hd or on optimus eyes to nine 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.909
 so a good year to fellow 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.009
 specific applications so by 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.920
 example the click memos which allows you to 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.959
 take notes on the fly like this and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 save them in a notebook 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.479
 in the gallery so that's 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.999
 practice and we will also find a 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.840
 translator who works with a 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.979
 camera once one is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.090
 downloaded a dictionary 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.129
 normally works pretty well but 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.730
 you must not have too much of a fool 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.730
 does then obviously there 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.040
 because I was afraid a little too much 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.209
 wiggle so it does not work but 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.420
 I tried before it worked enough 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.940
 well to something else we will find 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.459
 so that safety caire that allows 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.680
 to send his GPS position by SMS to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.200
 predefined emergency contacts as per 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.650
 example when we use beautiful 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.349
 smartphones for more than two days 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.959
 so it just allows to send back his 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.489
 position when when a little use 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.420
 suspicious or use rather 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.360
 suspicious of the smartphone we will find 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.760
 also a photo application 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.069
 totally reworked by lg so yesterday 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.950
 it also very practical so to the offer 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.819
 a fairly rich setting that we can 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.079
 set them to the side 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.360
 it also offers a very 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.590
 in vogue right now that is a species 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.220
 of timeshift how do we find on 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.890
 blackberry so say that allows 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.599
 to save photos before you press 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.239
 on the trigger 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.250
 so here we can choose then 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.380
 to record among five pictures what 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.239
 we agree we also find 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.530
 a voice trigger in addition to the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.480
 physical trigger that we find in 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.519
 down there so that's for example if I say 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.519
 cheese they say 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.260
 cheese 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.430
 so obviously there had to be some 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.080
 problems the day I'm doing the video so 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.290
 there it also works in parallel 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.890
 of the famous mode time shift so there is 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.020
 these practices 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.830
 we will also find a small 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.830
 video editor 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.700
 here I am, I made a short video 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.049
 before with two shots this not 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.090
 revolutionaries have a new time 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.150
 that 's kind of nice on a time 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.740
 on a smartphone so we can add 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.660
 transitions can add a band 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.570
 his kind of things it's rather 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.470
 practice so if not at the level of 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.370
 smartphone we will find inside 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.050
 a quad core processor of chekkal 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.270
 at qualcomm so the snapdragon s4 pro 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.010
 also found on the xperia z 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.960
 who is not out yet but who will be 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.190
 exit by then so for now 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.919
 remains the smartphone or can I there are 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.139
 available on the market but it does not 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.520
 the only advantage he has 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.669
 compared to an xperia zeal is that 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.810
 it will be available at the price of 250 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.100
 normally Euros naked while 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.800
 the experience is it will take 100 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.410
 euros more so it should be available 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.729
 from next month and we should 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.150
 also discover the steam games at 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.340
 pro at the mobile world congress at the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.229
 end of the month so again 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.229
 lg had a small size problem
