00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549

and<00:01:29.579> i<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.200> good

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and i really don't have very good

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.190 
and i really don't have very good
chemistry<00:01:31.799> outside<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.020> i<00:01:34.049> was

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
chemistry outside so you know i was

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.300 
chemistry outside so you know i was
thinking<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:34.860> easy

thinking this going to be a very easy
win<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:36.960> easy<00:01:37.200> game<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
win and it was a pretty easy game to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
win and it was a pretty easy game to
play<00:01:37.680> early<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> free<00:01:38.939> kick<00:01:39.150> sergio

right<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.549> ball<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> he's<00:01:54.180> pretty

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
right to the ball and he's pretty

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
right to the ball and he's pretty
accurate<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.860> gives<00:01:56.100> us<00:01:56.250> a

sergio<00:02:08.940> aguero<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.929> absolute<00:02:10.500> tank<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.069> mean

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
sergio aguero is an absolute tank I mean

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360 
sergio aguero is an absolute tank I mean
ninety<00:02:11.940> thousand<00:02:12.330> coins<00:02:12.420> he's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> little<00:02:12.900> bit

and<00:03:58.400> sister<00:03:58.549> parents<00:03:59.150> from<00:03:59.359> so<00:03:59.709> da<00:04:00.709> guavas<00:04:01.190> I'm

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
and sister parents from so da guavas I'm

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.069 
and sister parents from so da guavas I'm
pretty<00:04:02.120> much<00:04:02.299> looking<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.629> get<00:04:02.690> rid<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.900> him

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
pretty much looking to get rid of him

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.720 
pretty much looking to get rid of him
but<00:04:03.230> right<00:04:03.500> now<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.709> mean<00:04:04.040> I'm<00:04:04.220> going<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.579> keep

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
but right now I mean I'm going to keep

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.400 
but right now I mean I'm going to keep
him<00:04:04.970> when<00:04:05.329> my<00:04:05.480> defense<00:04:05.959> gets<00:04:06.199> better

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
him when my defense gets better

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.479 
him when my defense gets better
hopefully<00:04:06.650> he'll<00:04:07.040> be<00:04:07.160> getting<00:04:07.250> better

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
hopefully he'll be getting better

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.129 
hopefully he'll be getting better
because<00:04:07.730> he'll<00:04:08.150> be<00:04:08.180> getting<00:04:08.359> chemistry<00:04:08.930> and

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
because he'll be getting chemistry and

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.020 
because he'll be getting chemistry and
all<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.829> good<00:04:09.980> stuff<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.459> he'll<00:04:10.849> have<00:04:10.879> a

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
all all that good stuff and he'll have a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.789 
all all that good stuff and he'll have a
solid<00:04:11.269> defense<00:04:11.629> behind<00:04:11.780> him<00:04:12.019> but<00:04:12.199> I<00:04:12.349> start<00:04:12.680> to

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
solid defense behind him but I start to

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.740
