00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
we're going to start off by boiling our

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.530 
we're going to start off by boiling our
water<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.009> we're<00:01:32.009> simply<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.909> add<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
water and we're simply going to add the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
water and we're simply going to add the
water<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> pan<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.979> let<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.189> come<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
water to the pan and let that come to a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
water to the pan and let that come to a
boil<00:01:39.200> quarter<00:01:40.200> cup<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.500> sugar<00:01:42.200> level<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> off

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
boil quarter cup of sugar level that off

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
boil quarter cup of sugar level that off
nice<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.579> we'll<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.909> wait<00:01:45.060> until<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
nice and then we'll just wait until it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.030 
nice and then we'll just wait until it
comes<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> boil<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.259> basically<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.920> we're

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
comes to a boil so basically what we're

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
comes to a boil so basically what we're
doing<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:47.909> purifying<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> water

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
doing now is we are purifying the water

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
doing now is we are purifying the water
by<00:01:49.020> boiling<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> burn<00:01:50.070> off<00:01:50.220> any

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
by boiling we're going to burn off any

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
by boiling we're going to burn off any
type<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> chlorine<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> water<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
type of chlorine that's in the water and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
to stay at that ratio so then we're just

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.420 
to stay at that ratio so then we're just
going<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.450> mix<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.069> go<00:02:16.190> ahead<00:02:16.340> and
