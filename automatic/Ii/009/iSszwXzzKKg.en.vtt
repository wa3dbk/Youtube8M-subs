00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello today i wanted to talk 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.049
 with you about the most important element of growth 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.870
 plants is about watering of course you can 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.240
 make an old-fashioned watering dish 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.150
 and comfortable but worth it to strain their 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.609
 hands of power may be worth equipping 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 normal watering for this 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 Of course, that will do but the simplest 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.609
 this hoses every year we hear from 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.410
 buyers question what is the hose 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 choose in all variety i 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.460
 I recommend to choose two 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 hose one easier for example pvd 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 corrugated such a hose you get paid 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.559
 exactly 1 season but have a minimum 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 price 2 of course choose pvc hose 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.320
 oil from the lash hose from has two 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 The thread braid layer gives it elasticity 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
 and this hose will serve you for several years 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 because it is frost-resistant ie you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 can leave directly to the cottages 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 secondly it does not rot the water and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 Of course at the expense of the thread but he braid 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 very flexible does not break and does not bend but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 but for too practical people you can 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 advice hose rubber course cost 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 its much higher but it will serve you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.350
 very very long but comfortable 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.790
 water your beds of course 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.799
 I suggest you pay attention to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.960
 watering devices they will help you not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.030
 only connect the hose to each other in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.740
 case of different connectors but also 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.689
 choose nozzles with which it will be convenient 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.000
 water your plants but of course in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.090
 Ideally, everyone really wanted to layout 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.979
 the filing was done in such a way that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 could still be simplified 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 watering for this manufacturer us already 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 taken care created dacha 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.540
 plumbing kit even a woman behind 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 30 minutes without using any 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.079
 special affiliation can 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 collect at home this year about here on 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.220
 country house on such cultures as for example 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 cucumbers and can not do if the systems 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 drip irrigation what is good drip 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 watering well , firstly one hundred percent 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 hitting your water directly 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 the roots of the plant that is she its 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.320
 use not wasting second you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.570
 Do not water the weeds because 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 spraying the hose gets a lot of water and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.830
 outside the plant well, and the third in my 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.570
 not the most important quality system 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.430
 drip watering is something that you can 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 water your plants in any weather 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.780
 even in very sunny and so like water 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 falls directly under the root and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.860
 plant burning while leaves and 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.600
 every year and cottage 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.330
 we come to what you need to acquire 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.400
 pump the ability to dig a well in the country 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.170
 there is not at all but to drill a well 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.569
 most available for this now 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.430
 produce such pumps with a diameter 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.160
 only 80 millimeters which 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.709
 any well placed data pumps 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.959
 has an upper water intake since 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.150
 cooling takes place with the help of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.550
 pumps out and so you are extra 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.640
 thermal protection they do not need them 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.470
 designed for depths up to 25 meters in 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.330
 this season I have my friends 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.560
 have advised the drainage pump in 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.780
 plastic case 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.910
 it is suitable for dirty water but it is good 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 the fact that in the first he and for plastic 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.030
 shell its cost has decreased 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.100
 secondly it will last longer 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.959
 because it is not subject to corrosion of course 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 same at the pump in the most important thing 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.830
 specifications therefore in 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.320
 the store, contact a consultant 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.660
 ask for a warranty on this technique 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.440
 I wish you the sun in my heart and rich 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.440
 harvest in the country
