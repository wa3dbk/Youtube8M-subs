why doesn't he just always have them off
I<00:05:08.789> feel<00:05:09.390> like<00:05:09.630> that<00:05:10.020> would<00:05:10.169> make<00:05:10.350> more<00:05:10.500> sense

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
I feel like that would make more sense

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
everyone is then brought together in a

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.420 
everyone is then brought together in a
weird<00:05:51.660> limbo<00:05:52.140> state<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.650> begin<00:05:52.950> to<00:05:53.100> moor<00:05:53.310> in

weird limbo state and begin to moor in
Sonic's<00:05:53.820> death<00:05:54.030> but<00:05:54.690> then<00:05:54.900> Elise<00:05:55.289> says<00:05:55.560> that

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
Sonic's death but then Elise says that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.380 
Sonic's death but then Elise says that
she<00:05:56.100> still<00:05:56.400> feels<00:05:56.669> sonic<00:05:57.000> in<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.210> wind

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
she still feels sonic in the wind

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.670 
she still feels sonic in the wind
somehow<00:05:58.050> I<00:05:58.350> feel<00:05:59.600> Sonic's<00:06:00.600> presence<00:06:01.260> in<00:06:01.560> the

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
somehow I feel Sonic's presence in the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.650 
somehow I feel Sonic's presence in the
wind<00:06:01.919> which<00:06:02.610> means<00:06:02.940> that<00:06:03.210> they<00:06:03.510> could

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
wind which means that they could

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.390 
wind which means that they could
probably<00:06:03.840> resurrect<00:06:04.590> him<00:06:04.800> in<00:06:04.950> some<00:06:05.130> sort<00:06:05.280> of

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
probably resurrect him in some sort of

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.020 
probably resurrect him in some sort of
seance

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
seance

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.300 
seance
so<00:06:06.570> of<00:06:07.169> course<00:06:07.410> everyone's<00:06:07.800> like<00:06:07.950> that<00:06:08.130> makes

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
so of course everyone's like that makes

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.290 
so of course everyone's like that makes

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
sense let's do it

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.000
