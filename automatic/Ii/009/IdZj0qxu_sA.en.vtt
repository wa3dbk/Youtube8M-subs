and<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.950> soldering<00:00:17.430> irons<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.300> way

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and the soldering irons like way

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.010 
and the soldering irons like way
underpowered<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.790> probably<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.240> 15<00:00:21.810> watt

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
underpowered this is probably a 15 watt

underpowered this is probably a 15 watt
slaughter<00:00:24.560> ok<00:00:26.330> there's<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> capacitor<00:00:29.689> this

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
slaughter ok there's the capacitor this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
slaughter ok there's the capacitor this
is<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.020> wanted<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> show<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.710> i<00:00:31.950> just<00:00:32.220> want

everything if you have somebody to help

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
everything if you have somebody to help
you<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.370> great<00:00:41.809> ok<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:43.019> set<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you that's great ok I'm gonna set this

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.420 
you that's great ok I'm gonna set this
is<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.340> capacitor<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:47.479> looks<00:00:49.430> you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is the capacitor that I got looks you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.420 
is the capacitor that I got looks you
can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:52.100> it's<00:00:53.100> 47<00:00:53.940> d<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> rolled<00:00:55.769> around<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
can see it's 47 d you rolled around for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.000 
can see it's 47 d you rolled around for
it<00:00:56.549> so<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> see

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.310 

and<00:01:03.579> see<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.969> ones<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.689> should<00:01:04.960> be<00:01:05.110> totally

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and see the ones it should be totally

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.980 
and see the ones it should be totally
flat<00:01:05.830> on<00:01:06.040> top<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.729> mean<00:01:07.479> see<00:01:07.720> it's<00:01:07.869> like

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
flat on top I mean see it's like

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.840 
flat on top I mean see it's like
perfectly<00:01:08.049> flat<00:01:10.590> okay<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:14.399> let<00:01:15.399> me<00:01:15.430> get<00:01:15.729> rid

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
perfectly flat okay now let me get rid

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.639 
perfectly flat okay now let me get rid
of<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.000> soldering<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:16.689> for<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:17.020> moment<00:01:18.330> okay

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
of the soldering here for a moment okay

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.600 
of the soldering here for a moment okay
raise<00:01:20.649> your<00:01:20.770> own<00:01:21.509> firm<00:01:22.509> yeah<00:01:23.170> zoom<00:01:23.530> out<00:01:23.649> this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
raise your own firm yeah zoom out this

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.510 
raise your own firm yeah zoom out this
is<00:01:24.850> hard<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.570> thought<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:26.340> trying<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.399> make<00:01:27.490> a

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
is hard I thought be trying to make a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.389 
is hard I thought be trying to make a
video<00:01:27.729> i<00:01:27.970> explain<00:01:29.729> okay<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.130> board

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
video i explain okay here on the board

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.950 
video i explain okay here on the board
that's<00:01:33.700> where<00:01:33.939> i<00:01:33.970> took<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.619> capacitor<00:01:35.619> out

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that's where i took the capacitor out

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.899 
that's where i took the capacitor out
don't<00:01:37.960> let<00:01:38.200> me<00:01:38.289> get<00:01:38.500> in<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:38.890> far<00:01:42.539> but<00:01:43.539> it's<00:01:43.720> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
don't let me get in so far but it's a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340 
don't let me get in so far but it's a
it's<00:01:45.909> got<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.149> plus<00:01:46.509> sign<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.700> i'm<00:01:48.940> anna<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
it's got a plus sign and i'm anna the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's got a plus sign and i'm anna the
shame<00:01:50.679> part<00:01:51.069> is<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.729> negative<00:01:54.420> i'm<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
shame part is the negative i'm the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:05.809 
shame part is the negative i'm the
capacitor<00:02:00.569> will<00:02:01.569> go<00:02:01.750> back<00:02:01.959> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.229> stripe

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
capacitor will go back on the stripe

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.589 
capacitor will go back on the stripe
right<00:02:06.819> there<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:09.420> will<00:02:10.420> go

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
right there you can see that will go

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.400 
right there you can see that will go
over<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.959> shaded<00:02:11.349> part<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.110> double

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
over the shaded part then we double

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440 
over the shaded part then we double
check<00:02:14.620> yeah<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.370> stripe<00:02:15.879> will<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.209> over<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
check yeah the stripe will go over the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.540 
check yeah the stripe will go over the
shaded<00:02:16.750> park<00:02:16.989> i<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.379> see<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:18.099> been<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> while

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
shaded park i can see it's been a while

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.559 
shaded park i can see it's been a while
since<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.910> did<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.090> guy<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.720> bear<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:19.959> me

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
since I did this guy so bear with me

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.900 
since I did this guy so bear with me
yeah<00:02:22.569> but<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> stripe<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.680> negative<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
yeah but the stripe is the negative the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.270 
yeah but the stripe is the negative the
side<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.330> no<00:02:25.450> stripe<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.230> positive<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
side with no stripe is the positive and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.090 
side with no stripe is the positive and
you<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.780 

strike<00:02:33.460> right<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.400> put<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> new

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
strike right there so to put the new

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
strike right there so to put the new
ones<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.270> new<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.840> new<00:02:37.870> capacitors

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
ones on the new one the new capacitors

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
ones on the new one the new capacitors
the<00:02:38.820> leads<00:02:39.820> right<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.300> will<00:02:40.390> be<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> lot

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
the leads right here will be a lot

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.570 
the leads right here will be a lot
longer<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.650> leave<00:02:44.860> those<00:02:45.130> until

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
longer but you can leave those until

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.160 
longer but you can leave those until
after<00:02:45.880> you're<00:02:46.000> done<00:02:46.180> putting<00:02:47.020> them<00:02:47.140> through

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
after you're done putting them through

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.750 
after you're done putting them through
then<00:02:47.680> Cleveland<00:02:48.130> with<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> pair<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.580> wire

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
then Cleveland with a pair of wire

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.210 
then Cleveland with a pair of wire
cutters<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:50.320> then<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.860> put<00:02:51.070> back<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:53.220> let

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
cutters and then just to put back in let

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.640 
cutters and then just to put back in let
the<00:02:54.490> little<00:02:54.640> holes<00:02:54.970> down<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.480> there<00:02:58.650> till

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the little holes down in there till

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.810 
the little holes down in there till
we're<00:02:59.800> running<00:03:00.100> there<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.520> got<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> little

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
we're running there so you got a little

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.220 
we're running there so you got a little
bit<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.210> lead<00:03:01.450> way<00:03:03.240> or<00:03:04.240> they'll<00:03:04.450> stick<00:03:05.050> in

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
bit of a lead way or they'll stick in

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.900 
bit of a lead way or they'll stick in
there<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.480> have<00:03:07.690> flip<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.440> back<00:03:08.560> over

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
there then you have flip it back over

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.060 
there then you have flip it back over
just<00:03:09.910> put<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.690> little<00:03:11.050> bit<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.380> pressure<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
just put a little bit of pressure on the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.040 
just put a little bit of pressure on the
capacitor<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:13.240> push<00:03:13.600> through

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
capacitor so it a little push through

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.340 
capacitor so it a little push through
once<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.650> solder<00:03:14.950> gets<00:03:15.190> heated<00:03:15.700> up<00:03:15.910> again<00:03:16.350> let

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
once the solder gets heated up again let

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.750 
once the solder gets heated up again let
me<00:03:17.440> get<00:03:17.560> my<00:03:17.680> camera<00:03:18.160> situated<00:03:19.090> here<00:03:20.550> it's<00:03:21.550> like

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
me get my camera situated here it's like

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.830 
me get my camera situated here it's like
looking<00:03:22.300> at<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.450> mirror<00:03:22.810> trying<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:25.410> okay

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.210 

bear<00:03:32.840> with<00:03:33.080> me<00:03:33.110> folks<00:03:33.560> I'm<00:03:35.349> not<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.590> rügen

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
bear with me folks I'm not of rügen

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.559 
bear with me folks I'm not of rügen
camera<00:03:38.230> man

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.970 

okay<00:03:46.060> all<00:03:47.060> right<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.569> I'll<00:03:48.469> just<00:03:48.499> find<00:03:48.889> a

okay all right so I'll just find a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.339 
okay all right so I'll just find a
little<00:03:49.370> bit<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.579> pressure<00:03:49.790> put<00:03:50.719> the<00:03:50.870> soldering

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
little bit of pressure put the soldering

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.940 
little bit of pressure put the soldering
iron<00:03:51.560> over<00:03:52.010> there<00:03:52.189> and<00:03:52.519> just<00:03:53.120> push<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.540> through

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
iron over there and just push it through

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.220 
iron over there and just push it through
eat<00:03:54.950> him<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.280> it'll<00:03:55.730> kind<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.150> wiggle<00:03:56.599> one<00:03:56.930> part

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
eat him up it'll kind of wiggle one part

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.110 
eat him up it'll kind of wiggle one part
will<00:03:57.319> go<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.799> then<00:03:57.950> before<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.670> go<00:03:58.760> go<00:03:58.939> back

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120
