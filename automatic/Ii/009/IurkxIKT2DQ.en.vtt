00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
really big point that that I I want to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.980 
really big point that that I I want to
stress<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.550> simply<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.540> simplicity

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
stress is the simply is the simplicity

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.720 
stress is the simply is the simplicity
of<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.010> mean<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.310> look<00:02:46.490> it's<00:02:46.640> very

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
of this I mean if you look it's very

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.120 
of this I mean if you look it's very
basic<00:02:47.330> just<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.570> couple<00:02:47.750> o<00:02:48.020> bold<00:02:48.440> all<00:02:48.950> the

basic just a couple o bold all the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.400 
basic just a couple o bold all the
boards<00:02:49.580> here<00:02:49.760> coupling<00:02:50.570> between<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:51.260> get<00:02:51.380> a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
boards here coupling between just get a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.560 
boards here coupling between just get a
little<00:02:51.560> poetry<00:02:51.860> in-between<00:02:52.270> put<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.360> nails

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
little poetry in-between put the nails

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.590 
little poetry in-between put the nails
in<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.020> mean<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.470> simple<00:02:55.250> up-or-down<00:02:55.850> box

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
in I mean this is simple up-or-down box
