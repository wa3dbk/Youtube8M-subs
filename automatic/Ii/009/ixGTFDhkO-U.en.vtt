00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.310
 bear is that the list has been deactivated 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.400

 message so we 're going to go to a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.370
 public phone in the parties so that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 give us side missions 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.449
 Well now, let's start with the mission 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.510
 well there is sugar and he tells us that 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.250
 he liked the fact that there 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.339
 dead salvatore presents us to his 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.649
 brother who is gay and who also 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.960
 He has worked and he wants the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.110
 let's visit until Chinese sugar but more 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.080
 forward or is key work has 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.930
 wherever it is finally we go to the matter of 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.570
 the mission tells us sugar that there 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.590
 certain spies who are trying 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.440
 locate Claudio and this is going to be 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.470
 harmful either for both claudia and 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.119
 so much for the yakuza truth and that's 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.130
 bad then we have to eliminate 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.250
 all those types of spies 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.710
 surely the fbi 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.530
 and we have to kill ourselves good then 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.660

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.220
 is where are these guys we have 6 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.620
 real minutes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.120
 but let's try to do the most 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.180
 possible fast well then you have to 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.800
 have a sniper rifle remember 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.340
 that you can buy it in the ammunition of 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 state 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.930

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.820

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.450

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.800
 one and the other does not want until the square 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.190
 he does not want to enter so I'm going to shoot 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.840
 what dean good seen solved 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.560
 the police did not take is not very 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.160
 okay and now let's go to the second 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.810
 that is right here these guys are 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.650
 in a van hidden by where 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.870
 we have to be a little bit here 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.230
 the other group is a little over 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.720
 front and there are those guys like you 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 van 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.299
 and let's grab the cropped shotgun 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.940

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.760
 to destroy the vehicle well one more 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.910
 ready let's grab those weapons that are 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 ak-47 that are very powerful and very 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.460
 good range of gta 3 although maybe 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.500
 the m16 which is the m-40 anyway and that weapon 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.980
 they would unblock later 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.100
 holy set pinches cars as always 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.350
 you know how typical of gta they hit you good 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.600
 is now if we go to the other 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.510

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.860
