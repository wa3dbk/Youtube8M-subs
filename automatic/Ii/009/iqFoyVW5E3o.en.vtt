00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.440
 third is the group that I have the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.059
 group of people I already say the ones that came 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.160
 those who did not play the ones that touched them 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.910
 being outside is a group of very 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.560
 good and that inspires me that 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 when you have a very human group 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 good 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.850
 you can do important things well 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.310
 what we are going to look for I think that 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.910
 we are very calm I see it in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.040
 locker room 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 that they go out to look for the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 match but 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.450
 as of when the matches end 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 we are thinking about the next and good 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.120
 now we are already thinking we are leaving 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 we were talking a little bit so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.040
 He had lost the party than good 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.110
 let's start doing so 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.610
 while ours they are with the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.830
 head so I have no doubt that they are going 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.059
 to do throughout the year it seems to me that 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.040
 we are going to make it much easier 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.900
 thing and let's see that tranquility 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.980
 the one that refers without doubt that nothing 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the results for lemons and the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.540
 team may not be able to do it in the way that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.920
 as a volume of play everything but 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 work in the week they grab 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 correct but outside plays what 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 I pretend what happens that plays what 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.670
 reprimand also with you I do not think that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.820
 we have made a bad match if you 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.950
 they look at a match that was cut 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 constantly and that did not allow us 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 have that game volume and the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.259
 intensity that we want to impose but 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.850
 well we do not end up getting adapted 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 not to what is happening in the game 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.070
 here the same if the ball does not run the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.200
 game volume is very difficult 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.720
 beyond those little things that yes 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.979
 that still needs to work with the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.190
 results back 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.800
 in this in this match I only requested 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.670
 the volume of play the reality 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.010
 requested that it was going to be a party 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.240
 physical basis to an organized party and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.130
 that we were going to have space for 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.110
 rest sideways with the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.580
 ball can not have volume of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.460
 game when the ball does not run the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.870
 down 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.150
 to me they give me tranquility those that I have 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.880
 in there those who stayed there 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.490
 I have twenty of guys who throw themselves 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.190
 of head that have a barbarous desire 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.530
 and who want to be a protagonist then 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.530
 on that basis everything is facilitated 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.280
 as for how the court was 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.550
 it looks good or by features it was not 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.310
 the best to see 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.040
 I saw that the game we could not have for 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.990
 the outside and good and west the changes 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.030
 that from starting from goal I 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.680
 I wanted to save one because I think that 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.020
 when I connected very much you could give the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.000
 goal I wanted to save the change of sun and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.860
 that I had it in my head to stop 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.530
 last balls that is that they were going to be 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.980
 that ended in part with the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 collective I do not know what I do not know that I believed 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.630
 that they were not going to stay like that 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.220
 They were 45 believed they were not going to stay 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.840
 a couple more here at the end especially 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.150
 because I needed results 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.670
 they were going to come and we had gotten 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.440
 the two planes this on the outside that 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.310
 I think with space and we're going to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.380
 estimate was given one always thinks that it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.020
 can what if it takes a little bit right now 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.400
 what we were a thousand meters from franc 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.110
 I do not know 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.760
 I said please raise before the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.980
 arms because we had a delay with the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 important celebration until it did not raise 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.569
 the arms we did not know we had 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.680
 been in the same thing with this 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.680
 it's already a bit far away van gogh
