fingers I like to take my Beauty Blender
and<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:42.860> dampen<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.399> tip<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.850> with

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
and I just dampen the tip of it with

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.020 
and I just dampen the tip of it with
some<00:01:44.240> mac<00:01:44.479> fix+<00:01:45.050> using<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.950> mac<00:01:46.130> fix+<00:01:46.640> to

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
some mac fix+ using the mac fix+ to

some mac fix+ using the mac fix+ to
dampen<00:01:47.360> my<00:01:47.570> Beauty<00:01:47.840> Blender<00:01:47.869> instead<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.680> just

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
dampen my Beauty Blender instead of just

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.100 
dampen my Beauty Blender instead of just
regular<00:01:49.009> water<00:01:49.430> it's<00:01:50.030> amazing<00:01:50.600> for<00:01:50.630> under-eye

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
regular water it's amazing for under-eye

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.870 
regular water it's amazing for under-eye
concealer<00:01:51.470> just<00:01:52.039> because<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.430> helps<00:01:52.729> make

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
concealer just because it helps make

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.060 
concealer just because it helps make
sure<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:53.360> long<00:01:53.570> lasting<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.770> stops

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
sure that it's long lasting and it stops

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.770 
sure that it's long lasting and it stops
it<00:01:55.250> from<00:01:55.280> creasing<00:01:55.670> underneath<00:01:56.090> my<00:01:56.300> eyes<00:01:56.479> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it from creasing underneath my eyes and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630 
it from creasing underneath my eyes and
it<00:01:56.899> also<00:01:57.080> makes<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.619> little<00:01:57.830> bit<00:01:58.009> Dewey<00:01:58.310> so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
it also makes it a little bit Dewey so

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.690 
it also makes it a little bit Dewey so
that<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:58.910> doesn't<00:01:59.119> look<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.660> fake<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
that it doesn't look so fake and

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.919 
that it doesn't look so fake and
highlighted<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.850> mapped<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.420> further

using van nuys banana powder and I'm

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.290 
using van nuys banana powder and I'm
pretty<00:02:06.950> sure<00:02:07.069> I'm<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> only<00:02:07.580> one<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:07.970> does

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
pretty sure I'm the only one that does

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.820 
pretty sure I'm the only one that does
this<00:02:08.479> but<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.929> take<00:02:09.229> just<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.560> flat

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
this but I like to take just a flat

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.890 
this but I like to take just a flat
foundation<00:02:10.039> brush<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:11.390> apply<00:02:11.420> this

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
foundation brush to apply this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.380 
foundation brush to apply this
underneath<00:02:12.440> my<00:02:12.680> eyes<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.819> feel<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.000> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
underneath my eyes I just feel like it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.210 
underneath my eyes I just feel like it
packs<00:02:14.599> on<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> best<00:02:15.110> coverage<00:02:15.440> without<00:02:15.800> being

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
packs on the best coverage without being

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.610 
packs on the best coverage without being
overly<00:02:16.580> cakey<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:17.660> very<00:02:17.840> easy<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.230> sweep

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
overly cakey and it's very easy to sweep

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.830 
overly cakey and it's very easy to sweep
away<00:02:18.740> any<00:02:19.069> excess<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.060> also<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
away any excess and then I also like to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.930 
away any excess and then I also like to
go<00:02:21.200> over<00:02:21.230> with<00:02:21.620> anything<00:02:22.190> that's<00:02:22.400> left<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.849> my

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
go over with anything that's left on my

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.589 
go over with anything that's left on my
brush<00:02:23.180> right<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.950> typically

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
brush right here and this is typically

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.930 
brush right here and this is typically
underneath<00:02:26.599> where<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.230> my<00:02:27.530> contour<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.400> it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
underneath where I do my contour and it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
underneath where I do my contour and it
just<00:02:29.120> helps<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.450> further<00:02:29.930> sharpen<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.500> define

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
just helps to further sharpen and define

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.520 
just helps to further sharpen and define
it<00:02:31.069> without<00:02:32.000> actually<00:02:32.599> doing<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.050> since

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
it without actually doing that since

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.070 
it without actually doing that since
we're<00:02:33.709> pre<00:02:34.240> pre<00:02:35.240> applying<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.750> before<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
we're pre pre applying it before the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960 
we're pre pre applying it before the
contour<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> makes<00:02:36.890> any<00:02:37.099> sense<00:02:37.340> at<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.760> I

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
contour if that makes any sense at all I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.760 
contour if that makes any sense at all I
don't<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.569> what<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.620> now

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770
