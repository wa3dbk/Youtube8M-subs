thing is stupid water anyway and the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.050 
thing is stupid water anyway and the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
this level it's almost impossible to get

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.149 
this level it's almost impossible to get
rid<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.459> them<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.290> they<00:03:16.290> give<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.769> back<00:03:16.950> up

otherwise<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:49.550> really<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.000> big<00:04:50.060> deal<00:04:50.210> you

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
otherwise it's not really a big deal you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.690 
otherwise it's not really a big deal you
and<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.380> only<00:04:51.530> way<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.770> get<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.070> block<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.550> to

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
and the only way to get the block is to

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.490 
and the only way to get the block is to
use<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.970> too<00:04:53.120> many<00:04:53.300> items<00:04:53.480> really<00:04:53.990> because<00:04:54.470> it

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
use it too many items really because it

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.920 
use it too many items really because it
doesn't<00:04:54.920> appear<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.340> creative<00:04:55.790> so<00:04:56.360> don't

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
doesn't appear and creative so don't

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.330 
doesn't appear and creative so don't
even<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:58.400> as<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.940> will<00:04:59.590> see<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:00.860> does<00:05:01.100> not

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
even you as you will see it does not

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.480 
even you as you will see it does not
appear<00:05:01.580> in<00:05:01.880> creative<00:05:02.630> mode<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.830> am<00:05:04.130> showing
