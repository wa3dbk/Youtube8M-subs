00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.560 
around at least a little bit and you can
see<00:03:07.650> leveling<00:03:08.190> up<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.150> skip<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.450> tutorial

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
see leveling up so I skip the tutorial

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.080 
see leveling up so I skip the tutorial
so<00:03:09.990> just<00:03:10.170> let<00:03:10.350> me<00:03:10.380> use<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.650> level<00:03:10.950> up<00:03:11.100> won't

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
so just let me use that level up won't

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
so just let me use that level up won't
do<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> one<00:03:12.600> character<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.050> actually<00:03:13.380> lock<00:03:13.470> up

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
do a one character you actually lock up

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.930 
do a one character you actually lock up
all<00:03:13.740> through<00:03:13.950> your<00:03:14.070> characters<00:03:14.460> it's<00:03:14.670> kind<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
all through your characters it's kind of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.330 
all through your characters it's kind of
tactical<00:03:15.420> combat<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.960> can<00:03:16.080> pause<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.860> use

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
tactical combat you can pause and use

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.970 
tactical combat you can pause and use
all<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.520> abilities<00:03:18.380> or<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.830> try<00:03:19.950> to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
all the abilities or you can just try to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.130 
all the abilities or you can just try to
do<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.280> real<00:03:20.460> time<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.940> gets<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.150> little<00:03:21.300> chaotic

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
do it real time it gets a little chaotic

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.890 
do it real time it gets a little chaotic
so<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.680> recommend<00:03:23.400> doing<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.120> lot<00:03:24.240> of<00:03:24.270> pausing<00:03:24.720> I

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
so I recommend doing a lot of pausing I

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.620 
so I recommend doing a lot of pausing I
don't<00:03:25.890> remember<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.520> but<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.820> might<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.450> able

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
don't remember you but you might be able

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.300 
don't remember you but you might be able
to<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.350> pause<00:03:28.590> automatically<00:03:29.160> each

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
to have it pause automatically each

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.610 
to have it pause automatically each

quote-unquote turn cuz Dean D is a
turn-based<00:03:32.010> game<00:03:32.580> it's<00:03:32.850> not<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
turn-based game it's not really a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.850 
turn-based game it's not really a
real-time<00:03:33.930> game<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.960> kind<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.290> looks<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.710> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
real-time game it kind of looks like it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.190 
real-time game it kind of looks like it
in<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.130> game<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.850> really<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.690> kind<00:03:39.960> of

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
in this game but it really is kind of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.880 
in this game but it really is kind of
turn-based<00:03:40.710> so<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.370> think<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:43.620> you're<00:03:43.830> a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
turn-based so I think if you're a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.230 
turn-based so I think if you're a
min/max<00:03:44.190> fear<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.820> want<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.060> go<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
min/max fear if you want to go in the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.730 
min/max fear if you want to go in the
hardest<00:03:45.540> difficulties<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.320> should<00:03:46.470> take

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
hardest difficulties you should take

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.320
