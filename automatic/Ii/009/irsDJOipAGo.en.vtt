00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
I found wrong with it were the points

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
I found wrong with it were the points
were<00:00:29.400> dirty<00:00:29.990> thought<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> coil<00:00:31.679> at

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
were dirty thought it was the coil at

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.360 
were dirty thought it was the coil at
first<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:34.489> I<00:00:35.870> got<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.040> tank<00:00:38.040> hooked

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
first but it's not I got a tank hooked

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.740 
first but it's not I got a tank hooked
up<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.700> cuz<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> haven't<00:00:39.649> even<00:00:40.649> tried<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
up to it cuz I haven't even tried the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.970 
up to it cuz I haven't even tried the
regular<00:00:42.750> tank<00:00:43.200> yet<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:45.500> he's<00:00:46.500> pretty<00:00:46.739> little

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
regular tank yet but he's pretty little

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.229 
regular tank yet but he's pretty little
miles<00:00:47.190> 15<00:00:48.120> 10<00:00:49.579> hit<00:00:50.579> light<00:00:50.760> works<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
miles 15 10 hit light works and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
miles 15 10 hit light works and
everything<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
everything and I know this is not the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800 
everything and I know this is not the
way<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.329> supposed<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.960> these<00:00:56.420> but

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
way you're supposed to start these but

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:21.039 
way you're supposed to start these but
just<00:00:59.140> for<00:00:59.350> demonstration

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.190 

thinks<00:01:21.650> he's<00:01:21.770> running

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.930 

I<00:01:28.230> think<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.800> biggest<00:01:28.980> problem<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.640> right

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
I think the biggest problem it has right

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.520 
I think the biggest problem it has right
now<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.150> isn't<00:01:33.300> engaged

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
now is this actually isn't engaged

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
now is this actually isn't engaged
when<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:35.799> engage<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.430> drive<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:38.440> catches<00:01:38.860> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
when you engage the drive the catches it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.280 
when you engage the drive the catches it
isn't<00:01:40.119> letting<00:01:40.390> us<00:01:40.450> sit<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:40.780> at<00:01:40.869> idle<00:01:41.200> oh

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
isn't letting us sit there at idle oh

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.770 
isn't letting us sit there at idle oh
it's<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.880> clutch<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.240> always<00:01:43.570> engaged

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
it's like the clutch is always engaged

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.050 
it's like the clutch is always engaged
on<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> my<00:01:48.610> words

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
on it so my words

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.230 
on it so my words
I<00:01:50.149> like<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.930> stuff

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.730 

you<00:01:59.540> know<00:01:59.630> like<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.810> said<00:01:59.960> soon<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.590> engage

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
you know like I said soon as you engage

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.700 
you know like I said soon as you engage
that<00:02:01.130> driving<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.260> apply<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.290> rear<00:02:03.560> brake

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
that driving you apply a rear brake

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.860 
that driving you apply a rear brake
it'll<00:02:04.040> kill<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.370> motors<00:02:04.730> so<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.660> clutch

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
it'll kill the motors so the clutch

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.510 
it'll kill the motors so the clutch
obviously<00:02:06.500> isn't<00:02:06.650> working<00:02:07.040> right<00:02:07.929> that's<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
obviously isn't working right that's it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510 
obviously isn't working right that's it
you<00:02:10.520> got<00:02:10.670> your<00:02:10.789> little<00:02:11.980> stop<00:02:12.980> switch<00:02:13.280> here

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you got your little stop switch here

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.750 
you got your little stop switch here
pull<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:15.400> good<00:02:16.450> kills<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.570> motor
