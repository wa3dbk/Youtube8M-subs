00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.109 
will be a two part tutorial we'll start
with<00:00:15.660> making<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.170> background<00:00:17.130> water<00:00:17.760> ripple

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
with making the background water ripple

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
with making the background water ripple
effect<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.350> let's<00:00:19.529> come<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.010> our<00:00:20.039> file<00:00:20.490> and

and white there we want to come over
here<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> filter<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> filter

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
here to filter and we're going to filter

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.510 
here to filter and we're going to filter
some<00:01:05.100> clouds<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> render<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:08.430> we

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
some clouds and get on to render here we

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.289 
some clouds and get on to render here we
have<00:01:08.640> clouds<00:01:10.400> clouds<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> come

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
have clouds clouds I'm going to come

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.830 
have clouds clouds I'm going to come
back<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> filter<00:01:14.330> do<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.689> radial<00:01:19.130> blur

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.460 

Oh

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.840 

yeah<00:01:27.940> come<00:01:28.940> down<00:01:29.150> down<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> radial<00:01:30.170> blur<00:01:30.850> set

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
yeah come down down to a radial blur set

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.910 
yeah come down down to a radial blur set
that<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.360> above<00:01:33.700> turn<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.790> on<00:01:34.910> down<00:01:35.680> let's<00:01:36.680> say

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
that to above turn it on down let's say

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.590 
that to above turn it on down let's say
we<00:01:36.950> do<00:01:37.220> about<00:01:37.430> 40<00:01:38.080> 41<00:01:39.080> fine<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.210> spin

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
we do about 40 41 fine we have a spin

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.160 
we do about 40 41 fine we have a spin
method<00:01:42.110> will<00:01:42.440> keep<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.860> at<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> best<00:01:43.310> quality

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
method will keep it at the best quality

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.090 
method will keep it at the best quality
okay<00:01:46.360> there<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.390> see<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.960> drop<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.650> radial

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
okay there you see it drop the radial

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.800 
okay there you see it drop the radial
blur<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.700> come<00:01:50.630> back<00:01:50.810> up<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:50.990> filter<00:01:52.810> down

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
blur on it come back up to filter down

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.600 
blur on it come back up to filter down
to<00:01:53.870> our<00:01:54.580> sketch<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:56.260> we're<00:01:57.260> going<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
to our sketch and we're going to for the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.930 
to our sketch and we're going to for the
fast<00:01:59.270> relief<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.900> going<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.170> bring<00:02:03.320> us<00:02:03.440> up<00:02:03.619> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
fast relief it's going to bring us up a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.800 
fast relief it's going to bring us up a
few<00:02:04.940> options<00:02:05.150> for<00:02:05.710> fast<00:02:06.710> relief<00:02:10.600> let's<00:02:11.600> get

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
few options for fast relief let's get

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
few options for fast relief let's get
that<00:02:11.990> on<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.320> highest<00:02:12.740> detail<00:02:15.640> don't<00:02:16.640> know

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
that on the highest detail don't know

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.530 
that on the highest detail don't know
the<00:02:16.910> smoothness<00:02:18.190> 10<00:02:19.190> should<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> fine<00:02:20.180> color

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the smoothness 10 should be a fine color

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.880 
the smoothness 10 should be a fine color
I'll<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.650> down<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.860> bit<00:02:22.130> more<00:02:23.200> see<00:02:24.200> looks

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
I'll be down a bit more see looks

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.910 
I'll be down a bit more see looks
somewhat<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:26.290> ripple<00:02:27.290> they're<00:02:27.470> coming

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
somewhat like a ripple they're coming

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.220 
somewhat like a ripple they're coming
into<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.530> guys<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.980> see<00:02:31.280> over<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.080> see<00:02:33.080> we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
into you guys can see over here see we

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.890 
into you guys can see over here see we
have<00:02:33.440> somewhat<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.070> ripple<00:02:34.600> play<00:02:35.600> with<00:02:35.750> your

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
have somewhat of a ripple play with your

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.300 
have somewhat of a ripple play with your
smoothness<00:02:36.320> you'll<00:02:36.680> probably<00:02:36.950> want<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
smoothness you'll probably want the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.420 
smoothness you'll probably want the
detail<00:02:37.730> up<00:02:37.910> pretty<00:02:38.269> high<00:02:39.489> okay<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:41.300> then

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
detail up pretty high okay and then

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.320 
detail up pretty high okay and then
we'll<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:43.760> more<00:02:43.970> filter<00:02:44.450> effect<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
we'll do one more filter effect to the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.850 
we'll do one more filter effect to the
chrome<00:02:50.330> effect<00:02:50.540> here

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
