00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
playing breakthrough skill I find is not

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
playing breakthrough skill I find is not
very<00:01:14.369> optimal<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:16.170> know

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
very optimal just because you know

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
very optimal just because you know
you're<00:01:16.560> starting<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you're starting down with it now on the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.710 
you're starting down with it now on the
other<00:01:18.420> hand<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> start<00:01:19.439> first<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> use<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
other hand if you start first and use it

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
other hand if you start first and use it
it<00:01:21.720> provides<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.979> know<00:01:23.100> wonderful<00:01:23.460> advantage

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it provides you know wonderful advantage

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
it provides you know wonderful advantage
it's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> chainable<00:01:25.110> trap<00:01:25.380> card<00:01:25.619> that's<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's a chainable trap card that's the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's a chainable trap card that's the
other<00:01:26.700> thing<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.330> MST<00:01:27.720> target<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.140> if

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
other thing it's an MST target so if

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.429 
other thing it's an MST target so if
you're<00:01:28.380> playing<00:01:28.500> huh<00:01:28.680> very<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:30.439> monster

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you're playing huh very you know monster

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.630 
you're playing huh very you know monster
heavy<00:01:31.590> deck<00:01:31.829> where<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> wouldn't<00:01:32.220> play<00:01:32.430> many

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
heavy deck where you wouldn't play many

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
heavy deck where you wouldn't play many
traps<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.689> downside<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> break

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
traps that's the other downside to break

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
traps that's the other downside to break
through<00:01:34.590> scale<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.270> sucks<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.900> say

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
through scale it really sucks to say

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
through scale it really sucks to say
that<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.950> still<00:01:38.280> feel<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.670> Baylor's<00:01:39.090> more

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that but I still feel that Baylor's more

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.679 
that but I still feel that Baylor's more
optimal<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.850> certain

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
optimal just because you know in certain

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.240 
optimal just because you know in certain

monsters and less traps I mean you don't

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
monsters and less traps I mean you don't
want<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> draw<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.579> opponent's<00:01:48.030> I

messed he's on you know something that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
messed he's on you know something that
you'd<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.040> playing<00:01:50.220> defensively<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:51.060> common

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you'd be playing defensively it's common

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.039 
you'd be playing defensively it's common
knowledge<00:01:51.829> at<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.040> point<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.490> mean<00:01:53.869> if<00:01:54.869> you're

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
knowledge at that point I mean if you're

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
knowledge at that point I mean if you're
playing<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.470> monster<00:01:55.710> heavy<00:01:55.890> deck<00:01:56.040> later

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
playing on monster heavy deck later

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.399 
playing on monster heavy deck later
maybe<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.329> you're<00:01:57.450> playing<00:01:57.600> trap<00:01:57.930> happy<00:01:58.170> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
maybe if you're playing trap happy then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.649 
maybe if you're playing trap happy then
maybe<00:01:58.560> play<00:01:58.799> breakthrough<00:01:59.219> scale<00:01:59.490> but<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.479> like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
maybe play breakthrough scale but I like

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
maybe play breakthrough scale but I like
the<00:02:00.810> fact<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.140> Baylor's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> hand<00:02:02.070> trap<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the fact that Baylor's a hand trap and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.209 
the fact that Baylor's a hand trap and
it<00:02:02.579> can't<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.939> hurt<00:02:03.119> by<00:02:03.270> MST<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.770> gives<00:02:05.009> you

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
it can't be hurt by MST and it gives you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.020 
it can't be hurt by MST and it gives you
that<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.640> around<00:02:06.000> advantage<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.409> know

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that all around advantage that you know

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.190 
that all around advantage that you know
MST<00:02:09.030> won't<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.330> able<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.569> hit<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.840> mean<00:02:09.989> it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
MST won't be able to hit I mean it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
MST won't be able to hit I mean it's
nice<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.920> effect<00:02:11.190> veiler<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.580> your

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
nice that you can effect veiler on your

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.800 
nice that you can effect veiler on your
turn

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
turn

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.960 
turn
don't<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.050> me<00:02:13.140> wrong<00:02:13.170> by<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> by<00:02:14.220> any<00:02:14.250> touch

don't get me wrong by the by any touch

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.080 
don't get me wrong by the by any touch
of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> imagination<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:16.110> wonderful<00:02:16.680> but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
of the imagination it's wonderful but

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
of the imagination it's wonderful but
and<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.810> also<00:02:18.989> banner<00:02:19.290> ssible<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:19.739> me<00:02:19.800> give

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and it's also banner ssible for me give

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.850 
and it's also banner ssible for me give
it<00:02:20.069> if<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.580> was<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.120> effect<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.440> know<00:02:22.560> do

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it if it was the effect to you know do

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
it if it was the effect to you know do
it<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.130> both<00:02:23.280> players<00:02:23.580> turns<00:02:23.819> absolutely<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it on both players turns absolutely I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.270 
it on both players turns absolutely I
would<00:02:24.660> play<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> over<00:02:25.470> trailer<00:02:25.680> hands<00:02:26.010> down

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
would play this over trailer hands down

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.760 
would play this over trailer hands down
but<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.450> know<00:02:27.569> since<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.959> only<00:02:28.110> once<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
but you know since it's only once in the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.170 
but you know since it's only once in the
opponent's<00:02:29.160> turn<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> kind<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> loses<00:02:29.880> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
opponent's turn it kind of loses that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.440 
opponent's turn it kind of loses that
mobility<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:31.140> being<00:02:31.890> for<00:02:32.040> both<00:02:32.190> turns<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
mobility of being for both turns so the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.890 
mobility of being for both turns so the
argument<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.849> want<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> veil<00:02:36.720> or

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
argument is this do you want to veil or

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.780 
argument is this do you want to veil or
something<00:02:37.230> turn<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:38.430> stop<00:02:38.610> your

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
something turn one to stop your

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.790 
something turn one to stop your
opponent's<00:02:38.880> set<00:02:39.569> up<00:02:39.660> play<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.080> mean<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.620> why

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
opponent's set up play I mean that's why

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.160 
opponent's set up play I mean that's why
I'd<00:02:41.580> play<00:02:41.849> van<00:02:42.030> that's<00:02:42.269> why<00:02:42.450> Baylor<00:02:42.780> was<00:02:42.930> good

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
I'd play van that's why Baylor was good

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.350 
I'd play van that's why Baylor was good
because<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.950> stops<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.489> turn<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.940> play<00:02:45.150> when

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
because it stops the turn one play when

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.539 
because it stops the turn one play when
you<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.660> forget<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.930> go<00:02:46.019> first<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.799> let<00:02:47.519> me
