00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
current sensor suite and pulling out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.740 
current sensor suite and pulling out
obstacles<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:16.950> closely<00:01:17.220> ground

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
obstacles that are very closely ground

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.390 
obstacles that are very closely ground
but<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> robot<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.440> good<00:01:19.560> job<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.070> today

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
but the robot did a good job and today

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
but the robot did a good job and today
completed<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.210> milestone

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730 

in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> future<00:01:29.759> we're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.079> move<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.619> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
in the future we're going to move on to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.660 
in the future we're going to move on to
milestone<00:01:32.280> 2<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.509> consist<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
milestone 2 which will consist of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
milestone 2 which will consist of
integrating<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> arms<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> robot<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
integrating the arms of the robot and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.800 
integrating the arms of the robot and
some<00:01:37.770> grasping<00:01:38.280> behavior<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.390> we'll<00:01:39.540> try<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
some grasping behavior so we'll try and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
some grasping behavior so we'll try and
open<00:01:40.320> doors<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.520> offices

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
open doors and go in and out of offices

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
open doors and go in and out of offices
all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> time<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:43.170> also<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
all the time and we're also going to

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
all the time and we're also going to
push<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> navigation<00:01:44.460> stack<00:01:44.700> even<00:01:44.880> further

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
push the navigation stack even further

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.419 
push the navigation stack even further
requiring<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> full<00:01:47.310> marathon<00:01:47.520> or

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
requiring that it go a full marathon or

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.899 
requiring that it go a full marathon or
26.2<00:01:50.429> miles<00:01:50.880> suddenly<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> yeah<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.729> look

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
26.2 miles suddenly so yeah we look

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
26.2 miles suddenly so yeah we look
forward<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.390> doing<00:01:54.539> that<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> future<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
forward to doing that in the future and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.640 
forward to doing that in the future and
continuing<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> push<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> pr2
