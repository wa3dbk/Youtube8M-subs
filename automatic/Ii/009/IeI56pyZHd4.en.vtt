at<00:01:15.060> staff<00:01:15.960> looking<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.320> food<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> Ken<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
at staff looking at food a Ken all the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.100 
at staff looking at food a Ken all the
most<00:01:17.340> common<00:01:17.640> strikes<00:01:17.970> definitely<00:01:18.900> will<00:01:18.990> not

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
most common strikes definitely will not

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
most common strikes definitely will not
be<00:01:19.290> applied<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> teeth<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.850> get

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
be applied to the teeth because you get

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
be applied to the teeth because you get
people<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> keep<00:01:21.540> sucking<00:01:21.960> hands<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
people to keep sucking hands and this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.929 
people to keep sucking hands and this
rather<00:01:22.920> unpleasant

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:37.450 

yeah<00:01:26.570> we'll<00:01:26.899> build<00:01:27.109> up<00:01:36.009> just<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.130> word<00:01:37.310> on

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
yeah we'll build up just a word on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.590 
yeah we'll build up just a word on
distance<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.469> this<00:01:39.469> isn't<00:01:39.649> something<00:01:40.039> that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
distance and this isn't something that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.980 
distance and this isn't something that
obviously<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.049> have<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.259> time<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:43.179> if<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.689> put

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
obviously you have the time but if I put

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.080 
obviously you have the time but if I put
my<00:01:45.079> fist<00:01:45.259> on<00:01:45.439> pull<00:01:45.649> until<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.219> same<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:46.849> then

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
my fist on pull until the same and then

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.990 
my fist on pull until the same and then
we<00:01:47.179> step<00:01:47.359> back<00:01:47.569> in<00:01:47.719> camera<00:01:48.399> this<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.459> perfect

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
we step back in camera this is perfect

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.919 
we step back in camera this is perfect
striking<00:01:50.359> distance

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
striking distance

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.529 
striking distance
but<00:01:51.890> obviously<00:01:52.009> training<00:01:52.670> wise<00:01:52.819> you<00:01:53.270> wouldn't

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
but obviously training wise you wouldn't

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.260 
but obviously training wise you wouldn't
just<00:01:53.659> do<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.020> because<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:55.700> puts<00:01:55.880> cheap<00:01:56.090> it

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
just do that because it puts cheap it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.949 
just do that because it puts cheap it
this<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.109> only<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.469> learn<00:01:57.590> distant<00:01:58.629> the<00:01:59.629> ways

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
this is only to learn distant the ways

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.510 
this is only to learn distant the ways
of<00:02:00.200> knowing<00:02:00.439> exactly<00:02:00.709> if<00:02:01.099> you<00:02:01.219> can<00:02:01.399> hit

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
of knowing exactly if you can hit

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.469 
of knowing exactly if you can hit
somebody<00:02:02.439> here<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.679> I<00:02:04.250> can't<00:02:04.579> Hipple<00:02:04.879> go

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
somebody here I know I can't Hipple go

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.449 
somebody here I know I can't Hipple go
without<00:02:05.750> lunging<00:02:06.819> myself<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.909> balance<00:02:12.459> that's

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
without lunging myself a balance that's

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.309 
without lunging myself a balance that's
that<00:02:13.970> comes<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.329> experience<00:02:14.569> if<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.049> find

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
that comes with experience if you find

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.500 
that comes with experience if you find
that<00:02:15.440> you're<00:02:15.860> lunging<00:02:16.099> too<00:02:16.489> far<00:02:16.790> taking

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that you're lunging too far taking

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330 
that you're lunging too far taking
yourself<00:02:17.569> off<00:02:17.870> balance<00:02:18.079> that's<00:02:18.680> pretty<00:02:19.129> bad

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
yourself off balance that's pretty bad

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
yourself off balance that's pretty bad
so<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.299> is<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.510> these<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.989> practice<00:02:21.349> with<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
so this is how these to practice with a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.670 
so this is how these to practice with a
partner<00:02:22.989> because<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.140> me<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:24.319> willing<00:02:24.590> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
partner because to me that's willing to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.309 
partner because to me that's willing to
train<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:26.109> need<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> let's<00:02:29.660> start<00:02:29.930> off<00:02:30.019> with

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
train you need so let's start off with

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.780 
train you need so let's start off with
here<00:02:30.709> theater<00:02:31.099> camp<00:02:31.340> which<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:31.849> movable<00:02:32.660> best

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.880 

traditionally<00:02:36.790> wise<00:02:37.000> women<00:02:37.500> start<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.560> start

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
traditionally wise women start to start

00:02:38.890 --> 00:03:13.090 
traditionally wise women start to start
always<00:02:39.189> punching<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.790> way

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.760 

so<00:03:14.100> poor<00:03:14.400> Grayson's<00:03:14.760> punch<00:03:18.770> basically

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
so poor Grayson's punch basically

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.260 
so poor Grayson's punch basically
driving<00:03:19.980> himself<00:03:20.190> up<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.760> list<00:03:21.060> I'm<00:03:21.240> not

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
driving himself up this list I'm not

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.420 
driving himself up this list I'm not
punching<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:22.980> an<00:03:23.130> opt-in<00:03:23.400> camera

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.850 

this<00:03:29.430> hand<00:03:29.700> stays<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.470> covering<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> back

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
this hand stays up covering the back

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.330 
this hand stays up covering the back
elbow<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.960> case<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.380> doesn't<00:03:34.650> cause

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
elbow just in case this doesn't cause

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.790

of<00:04:39.750> my<00:04:39.840> body<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.860> we<00:04:41.280> can't<00:04:41.760> train<00:04:42.270> with<00:04:42.510> oh

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
of my body but we can't train with oh

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.129 
of my body but we can't train with oh
yeah<00:04:42.960> but<00:04:43.260> but<00:04:43.530> but<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.810> know<00:04:45.810> why<00:04:45.960> your

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
yeah but but but but you know why your

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.590 
yeah but but but but you know why your
transistors<00:04:46.740> if<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:46.979> technique<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:48.450> have

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
transistors if it's technique you have

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.719 
transistors if it's technique you have
to<00:04:48.810> concentrate<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.770> think<00:04:49.889> so<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.669> this

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
to concentrate on so I think so in this

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.540 
to concentrate on so I think so in this
instance<00:04:50.940> poor<00:04:51.330> skating<00:04:51.630> for<00:04:51.750> my<00:04:51.810> jaw<00:04:52.550> you

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
instance poor skating for my jaw you

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.219 
instance poor skating for my jaw you
know<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.060> can<00:04:54.120> work<00:04:54.390> on<00:04:54.539> that<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:54.990> work<00:04:55.140> on

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
know so I can work on that I can work on

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.480 
know so I can work on that I can work on
my<00:04:55.289> body<00:04:55.530> distancing<00:04:56.250> weapons<00:04:56.700> going<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.000> be

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
my body distancing weapons going to be

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.040 
my body distancing weapons going to be
so<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.520> was<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.820> end<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.060> looking<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.780> food<00:05:00.900> at

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
so I was the end of looking at food at

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.290 
so I was the end of looking at food at
camp<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.410> we'll<00:05:02.220> carry<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.580> looking<00:05:02.760> at<00:05:03.060> more

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
camp and we'll carry on looking at more

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.200 
camp and we'll carry on looking at more
fists<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> next<00:05:03.990> videos<00:05:04.880> this<00:05:05.880> site<00:05:06.090> you

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
fists in the next videos this site you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.630 
fists in the next videos this site you
can<00:05:06.330> obviously<00:05:06.539> experiment<00:05:07.140> with<00:05:07.520> take<00:05:08.520> it

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
can obviously experiment with take it

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.789 
can obviously experiment with take it
easier<00:05:08.910> place<00:05:09.510> don't<00:05:09.870> get<00:05:09.990> injured<00:05:10.669> thank<00:05:11.669> you
