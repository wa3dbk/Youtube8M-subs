 Olympiad, because it 's super to do is super. 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 easy is because this new one that people 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 there is no wheat at all with the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.770
 wheat with the group then I eat 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.140

 focus of red quinoa spreading 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 so it was our look around the aquino 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.969
 Aquino white is so cool and she was 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.250
 compared by some scientists to milk 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.439

 Granola was naked for about two hours. 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.519

 who wants to diet too because that 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.769
 at the time you start it was that 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.540
 expanded in are gustavo gives a 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.400

 Who cares why she's so slow to wait? 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.410
 granola to cool what I did enough 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.610
 here at home is not that there is much output 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.500
