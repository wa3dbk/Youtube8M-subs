 Good day, Mr. Oberbeck 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.960

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.950
 new art shop bought in place 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.230
 a very nice picture but yes but mine 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.120
 known doubt about the authenticity of the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.250
 Paintings could be a 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.110
 act counterfeiting 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.670
 We could be the director of the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.040
 to ask art museum 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.850
 proven expert 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.050
 and pepper could open his eyes 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.300
 to throw this painting 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.700
