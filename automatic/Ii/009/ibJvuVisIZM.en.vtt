 any company the zte keys model of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:19.199
 795 this process has been done for the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.109
 model of 791 instead of 793 with broken without 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.940
 road in this case is a model with robot 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.280
 finally let's start 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.400
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.740
 the user or some similar 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.170
 once downloaded and installed we will 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.360
 create a shortcut for it 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.210
 we must leave pressed with our 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.090
 finger on the screen 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 this pop-up window will appear and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.559
 we will select shortcuts and in the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.559
 that follows activities 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.850
 here we will look for one that is called ensin 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.850

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.030
 we select it and it will show us several 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.760
 options we choose the first one now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.700
 we'll see that we have direct access to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 that activity that we select 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 previously 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.890
 we select it and the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.149
 next window with the following 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.799
 options which we will be selecting 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.930
 these are responsible for the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.300
 release of our team let's start 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.500
 we select the one from up to down and in 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 Next we select a permanent log 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.030
 we accept and return 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.030
 in the next three we will do the same 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.850
 only in which appears first network 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.720

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 she will show us the following 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 we have only the option of a log the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.040
 password which will be yes though 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.170

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.680
 next password for these models 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.230
 the numbering from 1 to 8 so the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 we will put from 1 to 8 and select 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.070

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.040
 Express that our team 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.410

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.920
 we will do is select a permanent log 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.920

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.770
 now it only remains to turn off the cell phone and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.800
 put our chip at convenience 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.870
