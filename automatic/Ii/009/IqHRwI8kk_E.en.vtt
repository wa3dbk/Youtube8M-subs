away it doesn't most mascara is dry into

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.860 
away it doesn't most mascara is dry into
a<00:04:18.560> kind<00:04:18.800> of<00:04:18.860> like<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> tack<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:20.390> just<00:04:20.630> doesn't

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
a kind of like a tack so it just doesn't

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:30.090 
a kind of like a tack so it just doesn't
stick<00:04:21.080> to<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.290> skin<00:04:21.470> once<00:04:21.680> it's<00:04:21.800> dry

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.950 

I'm<00:04:30.580> gonna<00:04:30.730> start<00:04:31.090> doing<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.330> second<00:04:31.630> coat<00:04:31.810> on

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
I'm gonna start doing a second coat on

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.780 
I'm gonna start doing a second coat on
top

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.670 

so<00:04:39.270> that's<00:04:39.420> just<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.690> literally<00:04:40.290> two<00:04:40.470> coats

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
so that's just like literally two coats

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.570 
so that's just like literally two coats
in<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> top<00:04:41.040> one<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.310> bottom<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:47.220> I'm<00:04:47.370> not

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
in the top one on the bottom so I'm not

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.160 
in the top one on the bottom so I'm not
going<00:04:47.730> to<00:04:47.790> match<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.120> eye<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.810> I'm<00:04:49.050> going

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
going to match this eye up and I'm going

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.880 
going to match this eye up and I'm going
to<00:04:49.200> show<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.440> difference<00:04:49.680> between<00:04:49.710> a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
to show you the difference between a

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.560 
to show you the difference between a
cold<00:04:50.160> one<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.520> uncut<00:04:50.940> one<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.330> I'll<00:04:51.390> be<00:04:51.480> right

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
cold one and uncut one so I'll be right

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.980 
cold one and uncut one so I'll be right
back

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
back

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.750 
back
so<00:04:52.170> that's<00:04:52.350> both<00:04:52.500> eyes<00:04:52.710> done<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.700> can

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
so that's both eyes done and as you can

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.040 
so that's both eyes done and as you can
probably<00:04:53.820> see<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.420> there's<00:04:54.600> not<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.870> much

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
probably see like there's not that much

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.260 
probably see like there's not that much
difference<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.100> don't<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.150> eye

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
difference like I don't think that eye

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.010 
difference like I don't think that eye
looks<00:04:57.660> particularly<00:04:58.050> longer<00:04:58.530> and<00:05:00.020> maybe

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
looks particularly longer and maybe

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.690 
looks particularly longer and maybe
touched<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.680> not<00:05:01.890> directly<00:05:02.070> that's<00:05:02.520> why<00:05:02.670> I

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
touched but not directly that's why I

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.250 
touched but not directly that's why I
don't<00:05:02.790> use<00:05:03.000> eyelash<00:05:03.330> colors<00:05:03.690> but<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.110> do

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
don't use eyelash colors but if you do

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.480 
don't use eyelash colors but if you do
have<00:05:04.470> straight<00:05:04.710> lashes<00:05:04.860> or<00:05:05.160> short<00:05:05.340> lashes

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
have straight lashes or short lashes

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.490 
have straight lashes or short lashes
they<00:05:05.760> do<00:05:05.820> make<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.120> bit<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.450> difference<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.350> my

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
they do make a bit of a difference so my

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.990 
they do make a bit of a difference so my
second<00:05:07.860> tip<00:05:07.890> is<00:05:08.160> once<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.670> lashes<00:05:08.910> are

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
second tip is once the lashes are

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.120 
second tip is once the lashes are
actually<00:05:09.210> dry<00:05:09.450> getting<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.110> small<00:05:10.500> tweeze<00:05:10.920> like

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
actually dry getting a small tweeze like

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.040 
actually dry getting a small tweeze like
a<00:05:11.160> sharper<00:05:11.610> tweezer<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:12.120> love<00:05:12.420> these<00:05:12.600> by<00:05:12.750> barba

route companies and I'm just pulling
apart<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.690> lashes<00:05:26.420> because<00:05:27.420> I<00:05:27.510> don't<00:05:27.750> want<00:05:27.960> it

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
apart the lashes because I don't want it

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.600 
apart the lashes because I don't want it
to<00:05:28.170> look<00:05:28.320> too<00:05:28.590> clumpy<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:35.130> once<00:05:35.310> everything<00:05:35.490> is

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
to look too clumpy so once everything is

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.850 
to look too clumpy so once everything is
kind<00:05:35.850> of<00:05:35.880> done<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.510> next<00:05:37.260> tip<00:05:37.410> is<00:05:37.440> actually

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
kind of done a next tip is actually

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.070 
kind of done a next tip is actually
using<00:05:38.310> a<00:05:38.490> liner<00:05:39.090> now<00:05:39.450> you<00:05:39.510> can<00:05:39.750> either<00:05:39.870> use<00:05:40.050> a

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
using a liner now you can either use a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.510 
using a liner now you can either use a
liquid<00:05:40.320> liner<00:05:40.620> that's<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:40.980> a<00:05:41.010> pen<00:05:41.370> that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
liquid liner that's like a pen that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.060 
liquid liner that's like a pen that
dries<00:05:41.760> quickly<00:05:42.000> or<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.690> good<00:05:43.050> Kohl<00:05:43.350> pencil<00:05:43.380> and

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
dries quickly or a good Kohl pencil and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.600 
dries quickly or a good Kohl pencil and
the<00:05:44.490> trick<00:05:44.790> is<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:45.390> really<00:05:45.690> use<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:46.230> to

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
the trick is you really use this to

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.300 
the trick is you really use this to
blacken<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:48.090> tight<00:05:48.360> line<00:05:48.540> underneath<00:05:52.310> too

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
blacken the tight line underneath too

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.100 
blacken the tight line underneath too
much<00:05:53.520> ricks<00:05:53.730> I<00:05:53.880> have<00:05:54.150> is<00:05:54.390> actually<00:05:54.630> using<00:05:55.080> the

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
much ricks I have is actually using the

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.960 
much ricks I have is actually using the
loose<00:05:55.320> powder<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:56.010> if<00:05:56.310> you<00:05:56.520> really<00:05:56.730> want<00:05:56.910> to

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
loose powder and if you really want to

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.220 
loose powder and if you really want to
build<00:05:57.060> up<00:05:57.210> volume<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.810> don't<00:05:57.990> want<00:05:58.170> to

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
build up volume and you don't want to

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.110 
build up volume and you don't want to
use<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.350> primer<00:05:58.710> what<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.580> can<00:05:59.670> do<00:05:59.820> is<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.000> do

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
use a primer what you can do is you do

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.820 
use a primer what you can do is you do
one<00:06:00.360> coat<00:06:00.540> of<00:06:00.600> mascara<00:06:00.720> use<00:06:01.500> loose<00:06:01.800> powder

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
one coat of mascara use loose powder

one coat of mascara use loose powder
over<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.310> top<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.820> then<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.210> wait<00:06:03.390> for<00:06:03.540> it<00:06:03.600> to

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
over the top and then you wait for it to

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.940 
over the top and then you wait for it to
set<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.230> then<00:06:04.440> you<00:06:04.470> actually<00:06:04.800> go<00:06:04.920> into

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
set and then you actually go into

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.100 
set and then you actually go into
another<00:06:05.460> coat<00:06:05.790> of<00:06:05.910> mascara<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.750> just<00:06:06.960> feels

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
another coat of mascara it just feels

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.390 
another coat of mascara it just feels
like<00:06:07.230> that<00:06:07.380> added<00:06:07.650> volume<00:06:07.770> on<00:06:08.010> each<00:06:08.130> lash

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
like that added volume on each lash

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.360 
like that added volume on each lash
again<00:06:09.240> when<00:06:09.480> you<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:09.720> larger<00:06:10.230> lashes<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:10.830> it

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
again when you have larger lashes and it

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.800 
again when you have larger lashes and it
looks<00:06:11.670> a<00:06:11.760> little<00:06:11.850> bit<00:06:12.030> clumpy<00:06:12.330> which<00:06:12.540> I<00:06:12.660> don't

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
looks a little bit clumpy which I don't

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.190 
looks a little bit clumpy which I don't
like<00:06:13.140> so<00:06:14.100> it's<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:15.060> depends<00:06:15.750> on<00:06:15.810> what<00:06:16.020> kind<00:06:16.170> of

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
like so it's it depends on what kind of

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.420 
like so it's it depends on what kind of
effects<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.620> want<00:06:16.740> to<00:06:16.830> get<00:06:17.010> and<00:06:17.130> what<00:06:17.220> kind<00:06:17.400> of
