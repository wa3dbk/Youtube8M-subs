00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.490 

okay<00:00:01.829> so<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.190> gonna<00:00:02.370> draw<00:00:03.000> all<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:04.230> best

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay so we're gonna draw all the best

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.480 
okay so we're gonna draw all the best
Birds<00:00:04.859> all<00:00:05.190> possible<00:00:06.029> Vesper<00:00:06.569> shapes<00:00:07.490> so

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Birds all possible Vesper shapes so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.430 
Birds all possible Vesper shapes so
let's<00:00:08.849> first<00:00:09.150> start<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.900> simplest

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
let's first start with the simplest

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.799 
let's first start with the simplest
thing<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.889> most<00:00:11.010> complicated<00:00:11.690> so<00:00:12.690> we're

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
thing for the most complicated so we're

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.940 
thing for the most complicated so we're
going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> start<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.349> something<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.799> has

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
going to start with something that has

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.609 
going to start with something that has
two<00:00:14.340> groups<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.150> that's<00:00:15.780> leaning<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:18.619> let's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
two groups and that's leaning and let's

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.490 
two groups and that's leaning and let's
just<00:00:19.800> call<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.520> atom<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> middle<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
just call the atom in the middle a the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.220 
just call the atom in the middle a the
ones<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.949> outside<00:00:23.000> X<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.330> guess<00:00:27.230> okay

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
ones on the outside X I guess okay

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009 
ones on the outside X I guess okay
that's<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.710> linear<00:00:29.010> shape<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.539> groups

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that's the linear shape a has two groups

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.670 
that's the linear shape a has two groups
on<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.329> okay<00:00:33.590> I'll<00:00:34.590> put<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> two<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:36.680> two

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
on it okay I'll put a two here two

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.360 
on it okay I'll put a two here two
groups<00:00:38.059> alright<00:00:39.379> that's<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.860> two<00:00:41.129> groups

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
groups alright that's it for two groups

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
groups alright that's it for two groups
that's<00:00:42.180> an<00:00:42.420> easy<00:00:42.629> one

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that's an easy one

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.440 
that's an easy one
it<00:00:43.469> looks<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:44.149> HCN<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.390> something<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
it looks like HCN or something like that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.569 
it looks like HCN or something like that
alright<00:00:48.450> let's<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:48.960> another<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:50.340> let's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
alright let's try another one now let's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.000 
alright let's try another one now let's
go<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.059> three<00:00:51.420> groups<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.320> groups<00:00:52.710> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
go up to three groups three groups in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.520 
go up to three groups three groups in
three<00:00:53.370> dimensions<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.059> look<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.049 

I'll<00:00:58.530> put<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> bond<00:00:59.160> angle<00:00:59.489> by<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.820> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I'll put the bond angle by the way this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.219 
I'll put the bond angle by the way this
one<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> 180<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:02.760> three<00:01:03.210> groups<00:01:03.420> no<00:01:03.960> lone

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
one to 180 there's three groups no lone

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:13.210 
one to 180 there's three groups no lone
pairs<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> called<00:01:06.869> trigonal<00:01:07.320> planar<00:01:11.420> and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
pairs this is called trigonal planar and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.620 
pairs this is called trigonal planar and
the<00:01:14.220> bond<00:01:14.460> angle<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.180> 120

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.969 

okay<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:22.549> group<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.500> set<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.740> three

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
okay this group this set when three

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
okay this group this set when three
groups<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.509> lone<00:01:27.780> pair<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
groups can have one lone pair in it so

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.780 
groups can have one lone pair in it so
let's<00:01:29.310> draw<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.150> lone<00:01:30.390> pair<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
let's draw it with one lone pair and it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
let's draw it with one lone pair and it
would<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.750> taking<00:01:37.439> off

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
would look like that I'm just taking off

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.310 
would look like that I'm just taking off
one<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.220> random<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.479> doesn't<00:01:39.900> matter<00:01:40.020> which

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
one at random it doesn't matter which

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
one at random it doesn't matter which
one<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> take<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.220> happen<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> take

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
one you take off I just happen to take

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
one you take off I just happen to take
off<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> top<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.560> still<00:01:46.920> be

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
off the top one and this would still be

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.630 
off the top one and this would still be
trigonal<00:01:47.460> planar<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.810> electronic<00:01:49.590> shape<00:01:49.829> but

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
trigonal planar the electronic shape but

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.300 
trigonal planar the electronic shape but
the<00:01:50.759> geometric<00:01:51.479> shape<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.439> bent<00:01:53.159> so

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the geometric shape would now be bent so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
the geometric shape would now be bent so
still<00:01:56.310> electronic<00:01:57.000> shape<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.570> electron

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
still electronic shape or electron

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
still electronic shape or electron
geometry<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:59.009> trigonal<00:01:59.250> planar<00:01:59.729> but<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
geometry is trigonal planar but it's a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.600 
geometry is trigonal planar but it's a
bent<00:02:00.509> molecular<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.070> bonding<00:02:02.430> will

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
bent molecular and the bonding will

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
bent molecular and the bonding will
still<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> same<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.299> point<00:02:03.979> okay<00:02:04.979> those<00:02:05.460> are

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
still the same one point okay those are

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
still the same one point okay those are
kind<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> easy<00:02:06.149> ones<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> little

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
kind of easy ones that one is a little

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.630 
kind of easy ones that one is a little
harder

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.420 

let's<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.409> four<00:02:13.409> groups<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.010> software

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
let's go to four groups of software

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.119 
let's go to four groups of software
three<00:02:14.760> here<00:02:15.200> three<00:02:16.200> groups<00:02:16.439> let's<00:02:16.620> go<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.829> four

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
three here three groups let's go to four

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.000 
three here three groups let's go to four
groups<00:02:17.549> now<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:19.049> one<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.409> want<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.769> used

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
groups now this one you want to get used

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.649 
groups now this one you want to get used
to<00:02:20.099> drawing<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.269> if<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.599> to

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
to drawing this because if you go to

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.530 
to drawing this because if you go to
organic<00:02:22.290> chemistry

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
organic chemistry

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
organic chemistry
most<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.989> carbons<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.769> four

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
most of the carbons will have four

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.069 
most of the carbons will have four
groups<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.750> three

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
groups so there are going to be three

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.660 
groups so there are going to be three
dimensional<00:02:28.260> looking<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.769> looks<00:02:32.010> like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.619 

what<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.420> drop<00:02:36.659> two<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.530> plane<00:02:37.799> and

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
what I do is I drop two in the plane and

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.020 
what I do is I drop two in the plane and
two<00:02:39.629> out<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.470> plane<00:02:40.739> where<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:44.030> this

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
two out of the plane where this this

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.910 
two out of the plane where this this
wedge<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.409> straight<00:02:46.889> line<00:02:48.650> means<00:02:49.650> it's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
wedge here so a straight line means it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.250 
wedge here so a straight line means it's
in<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> plane<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.670> board<00:02:50.909> a<00:02:51.180> wedge<00:02:51.840> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
in the plane of the board a wedge that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.869 
in the plane of the board a wedge that
looks<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.620> triangle<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.519> means<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
looks like a triangle if that means it's

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.170 
looks like a triangle if that means it's
coming<00:02:54.150> towards<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.989> dash<00:02:55.970> means<00:02:56.970> it's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
coming towards you a dash means it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.379 
coming towards you a dash means it's
going<00:02:57.480> into<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> board<00:02:58.400> away<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.430> okay

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
going into the board away from okay

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:10.030 
going into the board away from okay
that's<00:03:00.989> four<00:03:01.319> groups<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.099> tetrahedral

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.990 

okay<00:03:11.090> now<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.359> can<00:03:12.599> have<00:03:12.780> four<00:03:13.169> groups<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.000> one

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
okay now I can have four groups and one

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.199 
okay now I can have four groups and one
lone<00:03:15.269> pair<00:03:15.859> okay<00:03:16.859> so<00:03:17.489> I'm<00:03:17.549> going<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> put<00:03:17.970> one

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
lone pair okay so I'm going to put one

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.240 
lone pair okay so I'm going to put one
lone<00:03:18.449> pair<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.319> I'm<00:03:19.680> going<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:20.040> just

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
lone pair on here I'm going to just

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.170 
lone pair on here I'm going to just
randomly<00:03:21.090> put<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.599> on<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> top<00:03:22.109> one<00:03:22.349> okay<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
randomly put it on the top one okay it

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.759 
randomly put it on the top one okay it
really<00:03:24.480> doesn't<00:03:24.810> matter<00:03:24.870> where<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.290> put<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.650> I

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
really doesn't matter where you put it I

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.530 
really doesn't matter where you put it I
think<00:03:26.129> it's<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> prettiest<00:03:26.940> when<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.239> put<00:03:27.419> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
think it's the prettiest when you put it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.280 
think it's the prettiest when you put it
at<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.780> top<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.190> how<00:03:29.430> I'll<00:03:29.579> draw

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
at the top so that's how I'll draw

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
at the top so that's how I'll draw
do<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.379> think<00:03:31.560> something<00:03:31.859> else<00:03:31.949> is<00:03:32.099> more

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
do you think something else is more

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
do you think something else is more
pretty<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:36.049> okay<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.440> is

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
pretty you can do that okay this is

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:52.140 
pretty you can do that okay this is
different<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:42.019> trigonal<00:03:46.280> pyramidal

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.000 

trigonal<00:03:53.150> pyramidal<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:54.260> should<00:03:54.590> look<00:03:54.800> like<00:03:54.830> a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
trigonal pyramidal it should look like a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.930 
trigonal pyramidal it should look like a
triangle<00:03:55.520> on<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.360> base<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:57.950> base<00:03:58.520> of<00:03:58.550> this

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
triangle on the base so the base of this

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.070 
triangle on the base so the base of this
pyramid<00:03:59.240> is<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.630> triangle<00:04:00.850> all<00:04:01.850> right

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
pyramid is a triangle all right

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.600 
pyramid is a triangle all right
tetrahedral<00:04:03.080> so<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.770> still<00:04:03.920> tetrahedral

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
tetrahedral so this is still tetrahedral

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.480 
tetrahedral so this is still tetrahedral
electronic<00:04:05.060> geometry<00:04:05.710> can<00:04:06.710> have<00:04:06.950> two<00:04:07.250> lone

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
electronic geometry can have two lone

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.830 
electronic geometry can have two lone
pairs<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.210> so<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.470> think<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.790> easiest<00:04:11.510> when

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
pairs on it so I think it's easiest when

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.390 
pairs on it so I think it's easiest when
you<00:04:11.930> put<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.260> lone<00:04:12.440> pairs<00:04:12.860> on<00:04:13.130> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
you put the lone pairs on the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400 
you put the lone pairs on the
three-dimensional<00:04:14.150> part<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.200> could

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
three-dimensional part so you could

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.949 
three-dimensional part so you could
appear<00:04:15.770> here<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.310> get<00:04:16.519> rid<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
appear here to get rid of that so it

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.740 
appear here to get rid of that so it
will<00:04:18.260> look<00:04:18.470> flat<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.250> then<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:20.180> gonna<00:04:20.359> spin

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
will look flat and then I'm gonna spin

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350 
will look flat and then I'm gonna spin
it<00:04:20.900> around<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.680> they<00:04:22.340> go<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.700> top<00:04:22.940> because

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it around so they go on the top because

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.120 
it around so they go on the top because
I<00:04:23.450> like<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.750> put<00:04:23.900> my<00:04:23.990> lone<00:04:24.170> pairs<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.620> top<00:04:24.830> I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
I like to put my lone pairs on the top I

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:33.960 
I like to put my lone pairs on the top I
think<00:04:25.520> it's<00:04:25.640> pretty<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.840> Compton

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
think it's pretty and this is Compton

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.200 
think it's pretty and this is Compton
and<00:04:34.970> you'll<00:04:35.390> see<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.720> does<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.290> looks<00:04:36.500> event<00:04:37.210> so

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
and you'll see it does it looks event so

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.050 
and you'll see it does it looks event so
that's<00:04:38.570> a<00:04:38.690> tetrahedral<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.650> erased<00:04:40.400> two<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
that's a tetrahedral I erased two of the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700 
that's a tetrahedral I erased two of the
groups<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.570> decided<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.230> off<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.560> wedge

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
groups I decided to take off the wedge

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.370 
groups I decided to take off the wedge
in<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.010> -<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.780> spun<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.870> around<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:45.140> little<00:04:45.200> bit

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
in the - I spun it around a little bit

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.080 
in the - I spun it around a little bit
just<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.919> put<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.220> lone<00:04:46.430> pairs<00:04:46.700> on<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> top

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
just to put the lone pairs on the top

00:04:47.090 --> 00:05:02.320 
just to put the lone pairs on the top
yeah<00:04:48.400> sure<00:04:49.960> oh<00:04:50.960> yeah<00:05:00.730> yeah<00:05:01.730> you're<00:05:01.850> not<00:05:02.060> gonna

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
yeah sure oh yeah yeah you're not gonna

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.110 
yeah sure oh yeah yeah you're not gonna
have<00:05:02.630> less<00:05:02.930> than<00:05:03.140> three<00:05:03.410> atoms<00:05:03.669> because<00:05:04.669> like

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
have less than three atoms because like

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.230 
have less than three atoms because like
take<00:05:05.330> linear<00:05:05.570> for<00:05:05.840> example<00:05:06.290> I<00:05:06.820> mean<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:07.910> guess

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
take linear for example I mean I guess

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.230 
take linear for example I mean I guess
it<00:05:08.390> is<00:05:08.510> linear<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:09.560> by<00:05:10.310> default<00:05:10.550> has<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.120> be

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
it is linear but by default has to be

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.540 
it is linear but by default has to be
linear<00:05:11.510> there's<00:05:12.140> only<00:05:12.260> two<00:05:12.560> things<00:05:12.830> attached

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
linear there's only two things attached

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.090 
linear there's only two things attached
so<00:05:14.210> tetrahedral<00:05:14.840> number<00:05:15.140> has<00:05:15.290> three<00:05:15.590> lone

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
so tetrahedral number has three lone

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.200 
so tetrahedral number has three lone
pairs<00:05:16.130> no<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:18.110> wouldn't<00:05:18.350> make<00:05:18.440> sense

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
pairs no it wouldn't make sense

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.490 
pairs no it wouldn't make sense
okay<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.330> bonding<00:05:20.810> will<00:05:20.960> thank<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.320> for

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
okay the bonding will thank you for

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.020 
okay the bonding will thank you for
saying<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:22.160> one<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:23.950> 9.5<00:05:24.950> that's<00:05:25.850> the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
saying that is one a 9.5 that's the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.820 
saying that is one a 9.5 that's the
first<00:05:26.300> bond<00:05:26.660> angle<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.290> think<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.680> really

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
first bond angle that I think you really

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.430 
first bond angle that I think you really
need<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.190> memorize<00:05:28.640> because<00:05:29.360> this<00:05:29.900> one<00:05:30.169> just

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
need to memorize because this one just

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.190 
need to memorize because this one just
comes<00:05:30.620> with<00:05:30.710> three<00:05:30.950> six<00:05:31.190> divided<00:05:31.490> by<00:05:31.520> two<00:05:32.200> 120

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
comes with three six divided by two 120

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.630 
comes with three six divided by two 120
comes<00:05:33.440> from<00:05:33.680> three<00:05:33.919> 6<00:05:34.160> mm<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:36.350> 109.5<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:37.400> can

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
comes from three 6 mm so 109.5 you can

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.290 
comes from three 6 mm so 109.5 you can
derive<00:05:37.910> it<00:05:38.210> but<00:05:38.479> that's<00:05:39.350> pretty<00:05:39.620> nerdy<00:05:40.180> so

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.159 

there's<00:05:44.300> all<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.320> four<00:05:45.650> group<00:05:46.070> ones

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
there's all the four group ones

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.960 
there's all the four group ones
notice<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.440> these<00:05:48.860> two<00:05:49.190> are<00:05:49.310> both<00:05:49.520> called

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
notice that these two are both called

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.440 
notice that these two are both called
bent<00:05:50.440> but<00:05:51.440> they're<00:05:51.620> different<00:05:51.860> because<00:05:52.700> this

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
bent but they're different because this

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.750 
bent but they're different because this
has<00:05:53.630> one<00:05:53.840> lone<00:05:54.020> pair<00:05:54.050> this<00:05:54.470> has<00:05:54.680> two<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.640> they

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
has one lone pair this has two so they

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.940 
has one lone pair this has two so they
are<00:05:56.000> different<00:05:56.479> and<00:05:56.660> our<00:05:56.780> electronic<00:05:57.380> name<00:05:57.770> is

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
are different and our electronic name is

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.220 
are different and our electronic name is
there

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
there

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.470 
there
this<00:05:58.740> is<00:05:58.920> bent<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.760> trigonal<00:06:00.150> planar

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
this is bent the trigonal planar

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.420 
this is bent the trigonal planar
electronic<00:06:01.050> group<00:06:01.200> this<00:06:01.350> is<00:06:01.410> bent<00:06:01.800> with

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
electronic group this is bent with

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.060 
electronic group this is bent with
tetrahedral<00:06:03.230> electronic<00:06:05.060> junky
