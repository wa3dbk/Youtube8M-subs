00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello to all I have already presented to you the 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.900
 bread baked at the tip today we're going 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.010
 make a good home and then bake 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.320
 so to see the list of ingredients 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.150
 you click on the recipe card or on 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.210
 the link at the bottom of this video has everything from 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.210
 after 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.410
 the first step of our recipe 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.520
 would be to mix the measure with the su 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.320
 and lukewarm water 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.980
 the purpose of this operation is 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.330
 to activate the hard so I use here the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.930
 fresh yeast but you can also 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.610
 use the dry baker video so 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.920
 I mix everything and I leave aside 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:58.129
 2 to 3 minutes in the bowl of a robot I 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.309
 put flour in a teaspoon of 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.309
 salt 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.030
 I add the yeast mixture 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.830
 I add a small amount of water and the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.810
 rest I'm going to gradually add it to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 as I pick up the dough 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.170
 once the dough forms and you can 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.850
 continue to work another four to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.440
 six minutes to robots or a 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.509
 ten minutes is tried by hand 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.850
 until you have a good dough 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.560
 homogeneous smooth and they are 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.509
 elastic is not sticky 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.729
 in this case we will cover it and we will 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.920
 let stand for 20 to 30 minutes 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.920
 or until its double its volume 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.149
 once the dough is raised to divide it 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.409
 on three or four legs have according to the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.409
 size you want to give your steps 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.540
 flour your work plan and try 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.320
 to give a ball shape to each 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 pasta portion 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 no 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.150
 place the pins on the oven plate 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.340
 grafting or dressing parchment paper 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.489
 before starting to flatten them to the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.489
 hand 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.370
 I cover the bread and let it rest 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.080
 another 15 minutes 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.050
 meantime I'm going to preheat the oven 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.450
 at 220 degrees but before baking my 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.670
 bread I'm going to basting with 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.420
 the water will give it a beautiful color 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.580
 in the oven with crisps you can 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.200
 also decorated with seeds be 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.960
 sesame seeds or dead seeds 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.060
 as we want after twenty-five to thirty 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.250
 minutes of cooking the bread has to come out 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.870
 the golden oven on both sides 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.080
 crisps from the outside with the union 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.710
 very mellow and airy really very 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.620
