00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
some people will make more the fact now

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.169 
some people will make more the fact now
that<00:00:01.589> you<00:00:01.890> had<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.100> have<00:00:02.460> an<00:00:02.550> extended<00:00:03.030> break

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
that you had to have an extended break

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.599 
that you had to have an extended break
because<00:00:03.920> when<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.009> when<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.160> when<00:00:05.310> you

because when you when you when you

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.039 
because when you when you when you
perhaps<00:00:05.790> if<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.120> had<00:00:06.150> played<00:00:06.509> more<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.899> might

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
perhaps if you had played more you might

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.350 
perhaps if you had played more you might
not<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.680> played<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.700> what

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
not have played like that is it what

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.299 
not have played like that is it what
would<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.510> make<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.870> argument<00:00:10.309> who

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
would you make of that argument who

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.150 
would you make of that argument who
knows<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.910> mean<00:00:12.269> could<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.230> lost<00:00:13.410> same<00:00:13.889> round

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
knows I mean could have lost same round

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.099 
knows I mean could have lost same round
last<00:00:14.400> year<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:15.410> was<00:00:16.410> very<00:00:16.590> close<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.130> well<00:00:17.310> so

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
last year I was very close as well so

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.060 
last year I was very close as well so
sometimes<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.260> win<00:00:19.410> them<00:00:19.590> sometimes<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
sometimes you win them sometimes you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.720 
sometimes you win them sometimes you
lose<00:00:20.189> them<00:00:20.460> unfortunately<00:00:22.699> obviously<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
lose them unfortunately obviously I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
lose them unfortunately obviously I
rarely<00:00:24.060> lose<00:00:24.359> matches<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.170> having<00:00:25.439> no

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
rarely lose matches you know having no

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.019 
rarely lose matches you know having no
chances<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> Hat<00:00:26.430> chances<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
chances and the Hat chances in the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.650 
chances and the Hat chances in the
beginning<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> third<00:00:29.179> but<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.330> struggle

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
beginning of the third but just struggle

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.889 
beginning of the third but just struggle
overall<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.510> at<00:00:33.510> least<00:00:33.660> them

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
overall you know so just at least them

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.530 
overall you know so just at least them
all<00:00:34.050> come<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:35.000> some<00:00:36.000> ideas<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.480> what

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
all come up with some some ideas of what

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.760 
all come up with some some ideas of what
I<00:00:36.660> need<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> work<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:39.200> clearly<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> ball<00:00:40.410> flies

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I need to work on clearly the ball flies

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
I need to work on clearly the ball flies
here<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.850> faster<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.870> makes<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
here and it's faster so that makes it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.630 
here and it's faster so that makes it
something<00:00:43.530> more<00:00:43.649> tricky<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> find<00:00:44.399> your

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
something more tricky to find your

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.250 
something more tricky to find your
rhythm<00:00:45.950> we're<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.070> accustomed<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.670> always

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
rhythm we're so accustomed to always

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
rhythm we're so accustomed to always
find<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> rhythm<00:00:49.620> eventually<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
find that rhythm eventually and it's so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
find that rhythm eventually and it's so
two<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.570> disappoint<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.350> never

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
two more disappoint if you don't never

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
two more disappoint if you don't never
really<00:00:52.949> find<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> case<00:00:54.239> today

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
really find it which was the case today

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.650 
really find it which was the case today
but<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.309> mean<00:00:56.309> credit<00:00:56.610> ok<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> mean<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
but I mean credit ok I mean you know you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
but I mean credit ok I mean you know you
got<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> done<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.149> was<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.329> solid<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
got it done and was more solid in the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.479 
got it done and was more solid in the
wind<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.730> he<00:01:02.730> played<00:01:02.940> better<00:01:03.090> than<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> did<00:01:03.449> so

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
wind and he played better than I did so

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.609 
wind and he played better than I did so
the<00:01:05.489> better<00:01:05.670> guy<00:01:05.880> wanted<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.750> sure

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.160 

Roger<00:01:10.619> yeah<00:01:11.340> he<00:01:12.090> said<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> second

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
Roger yeah he said that in the second

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679 
Roger yeah he said that in the second
set<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.460> he<00:01:14.580> got<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.299> worried

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
set you know he got a little bit worried

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
set you know he got a little bit worried
because<00:01:15.810> he<00:01:16.290> thought<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.770> played<00:01:17.250> more

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
because he thought you played more

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.100 
because he thought you played more
aggressively<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> beginning

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
aggressively and then in the beginning

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
aggressively and then in the beginning
of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> third<00:01:19.470> set<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:20.340> thought<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.970> very

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
of the third set he thought you very

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
of the third set he thought you very
aggressive<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
aggressive also but then you know as the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
aggressive also but then you know as the
match<00:01:24.150> went<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.990> her<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.409> seem<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> little

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
match went on like her you seem a little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
match went on like her you seem a little
be<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.250> defensive<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.960> was

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
be more defensive so do you think it was

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.200 
be more defensive so do you think it was
because<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.380> his<00:01:28.500> game<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.250> yours<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.360> mean<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
because of his game or yours I mean it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
because of his game or yours I mean it's
probably<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.420> mine<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.110> obviously

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
probably more mine you know obviously

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.960 
probably more mine you know obviously
when<00:01:34.799> you're<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.340> trying<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.790> get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
when you're down you're trying to get

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
when you're down you're trying to get
the<00:01:36.119> ball<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.360> first<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.110> before<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the ball in first of all before you're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
the ball in first of all before you're
gonna<00:01:37.680> go<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.329> instead<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.630> handing

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
gonna go for it instead of just handing

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
gonna go for it instead of just handing
it<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.790> always<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.119> fine<00:01:42.360> line

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it over so there's always a fine line

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.600 
it over so there's always a fine line
between<00:01:42.689> how<00:01:43.680> aggressive<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
between how aggressive do you want to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
between how aggressive do you want to
play<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.090> how<00:01:45.180> safe<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> play<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
play and how safe you want to play and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
play and how safe you want to play and
that's<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.180> struggled<00:01:48.600> with

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that's the bit I think I struggled with

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.330 
that's the bit I think I struggled with
the<00:01:48.840> most<00:01:49.049> today<00:01:54.409> how<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> debate

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the most today how about the debate

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
obviously it's it's nothing like playing

well for Paris is this one of those
tournaments<00:02:05.939> where<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.570> maybe<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
tournaments where you think maybe I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.139

should<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.860> shouldn't<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.550> whether<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
should maybe I shouldn't and whether it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.449 
should maybe I shouldn't and whether it
actually<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> conditions<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
actually because the conditions are so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.750 
actually because the conditions are so

lead-up tournament but also that somehow

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.910 
lead-up tournament but also that somehow
I<00:02:58.349> see<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.889> for<00:02:59.099> me<00:02:59.220> every<00:02:59.459> tournament<00:02:59.760> counts

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.460 
I see it for me every tournament counts
so<00:03:02.090> I'm<00:03:03.090> as<00:03:03.329> disappointed<00:03:03.450> losing<00:03:04.139> here<00:03:04.319> than

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
so I'm as disappointed losing here than

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
so I'm as disappointed losing here than
in<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.099> french<00:03:05.340> open<00:03:05.489> for<00:03:05.879> me<00:03:05.970> there

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
in at the french open for me there

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.839 
in at the french open for me there
there's<00:03:06.389> no<00:03:06.540> difference<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.849> for

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
there's no difference really and for

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.030 
there's no difference really and for
that<00:03:08.879> reason<00:03:09.000> we<00:03:09.810> already<00:03:10.079> switched<00:03:10.409> Madrid

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
that reason we already switched Madrid

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.949 
that reason we already switched Madrid
and<00:03:11.159> roam<00:03:11.340> around<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.480> think<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.840> works<00:03:13.760> well

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
and roam around so I think it works well

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.990 
and roam around so I think it works well
this<00:03:15.959> way<00:03:16.169> and<00:03:19.400> what<00:03:20.400> else<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:20.699> want<00:03:20.730> me<00:03:20.849> to

this way and what else you want me to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.099 
this way and what else you want me to
say<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.180> mean<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.569> think<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:23.599> yes<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.780> feel
