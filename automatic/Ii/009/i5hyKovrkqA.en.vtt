00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.150
 in this the smart so that many you 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.939
 you will know why it is one of the fashions most 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.679
 famous of minecraft however this one 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:29.349
 fashions different animations for example 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:33.780
 animations size animations that 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.750
 will make the game more real for example 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.090
 they have things like jumps as well while 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.900
 we still want to do now seeing 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 anyway, and in the meantime he 's like 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.450
 destroying to show when you notice 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.340
 however this fashion is also useful 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.550
 example in the park maps if we want 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.740
 make the video more beautiful anyway you 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.680
 I'll show you now I'm flying and how 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.989
 see from superman and don't fly like 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.659
 we normally say without fashions wanted 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.690
 give up when a man looked at you 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.000
 when note animation as if not 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.930
 we really had then also 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.180
 this animation 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.210
 I remember very few of them now I remember 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.409
 this too is done this way e 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.070
 if there are so many videos that 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.990
 demonstrate how to use this 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.520
 fashions and keys I know them all 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.240
 so I suggest you go and see 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.479
 the various videos because it is still alive 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.729
 access only the fashion how it works yes 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.270
 this is a light sport as you know 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.630
 I'm struggling to make videos instead 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.520
 because between schoolchildren are many tasks 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.800
 that if today the strike 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.090
 watch 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.740
 very real dates in looks a lot like either 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.190
 in fact, there are many animations at parkour 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 parkour type that maybe I'll even do a 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.560
 video tutorial on the keys 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.560
 yes maybe I'll even make a video tutorial by 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.810
 but you still have keys 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.550
 I think you can skip another thing 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.840
 and two blocks 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.330
 by clicking and holding ctrl so can 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
 and he knows things this way it also seems 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.000
 now let's see this real two 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.840
 blocks 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.420
 as you can see, let's wait here and here 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 see you at the next video and excuse me 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.830
 also because these videos are dead but 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.550
 I will do you tutorials and a lot soon 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.550
 other beautiful
