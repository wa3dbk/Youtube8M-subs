00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.169
 with photoshop cs 6 offers them 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.600
 a whole new correction of objective 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.500
 conditional distortions and perspective 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.270
 conditional distortion 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.610
 Of course that's what you're talking about first and foremost 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.800
 Recordings in close-up 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.700
 situation have arisen and with short 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.910
 focal lengths were photographed 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.010
 The mentioned correction means 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 adaptive wide angle correction and different 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.570
 as the lens correction, this runs 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.370
 not automatically after a correction 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.860
 profile off but can from them 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.210
 be influenced individually and on 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 different parts of the picture 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.070
 be applied differently before 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 But I'll turn this filter on walls 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 I make sure my picture is in one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 So smart object is converted for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.570
 smart filter is converted and I like that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.570
 always edit the filter 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.670
 so now I'm going to the adaptive 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.199
 wide angle correction 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.970
 and then get a brand new one 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.710
 working window 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.900
 in this new filter finds 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.160
 automatically a correction instead of you 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 see that the correction on this 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.550
 automatically stands and they can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.760
 the preview of the already 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.060
 also made correction to and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.680
 switch off 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 However, this does not lead to the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 We want to get there 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.399
 I would like to give him more options 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.110
 show they can also slowly 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.759
 zoom revise the correction 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.970
 For example, by looking at one 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.799
 Switch perspective correction and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.229
 here the focal length does not change the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.560
 focal length alters also changes 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 the corresponding perspective or 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 the distortion 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.610
 You can do both the snow 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.250
 Young's factor as well as the whole 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.870
 Scale change the more you look 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.770
 on the picture and the corresponding 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.229
 to get distortion 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.719
 But you can also say with the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.480
 start automatic correction and then 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.460
 to access the tools 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.620
 the most important tools and the new ones 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.980
 tools are the first two 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.820
 both are tools to either lines 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.800
 in the almost forcing or polygons in 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.960
 to force a rectangle like that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.150
 I want to show you how it works 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.670
 let's start with the line tool 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.770
 that's already chosen anyway and 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.450
 let's go over these houses knew 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.290
 yes, a very clear bow 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.000
 describes I click on the one 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.530
 corner of the houses knew and then pull 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.240
 just down here and see them 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.440
 maybe that one bow 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.420
 bit is recorded 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.120
 also look at the magnification 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.880
 falls in the right area here you can 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 that exactly adapted to the houses knew 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.220
 if I let go now this will 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.170
 straightened bow that is now in this 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.750
 small size not so clear 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 it becomes visibly more visible when I see the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.740
 Shift-key to do that if I have the 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.030
 The shift-key will stay in the bow 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.370
 I follow now 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.160
 immediately converted to a vertical one 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.959
 and with that you change this picture 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.640
 of course, especially if 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.470
 I also do it on the second page 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.540
 Here I will also know the houses 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.200
 also aim with pressed shift 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.850
 button 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.340
 Now you see what happened to her 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.260
 forced two straight 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.360
 and I can do that now 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.550
 picture I make permanent prints 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.450
 shift button if i have vertical or 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.090
 want to generate horizontal lines and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.940
 the exif-data of the picture take care completely 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.250
 alone for the fact that the still existing 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.519
 Distortion of the picture with added 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.830
 becomes 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.560
 I'll draw a horizontal one 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.959
 after also with depressed shift button I 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.739
 Think here they see clearly how 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.230
 the existing distortion of the picture 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.450
 is detected is recorded and the same 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.010
 we will fix it below 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.790
 the stairs again and see there 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.069
 They also that this area also 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.069
 this line can force into the straight 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.280
 so a few more corrections in 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.109
 small straight now I'm short 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.019
 glued that makes him control and 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:19.030
 undo it is that way 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.250
 the straight ones they do not tackle 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.740
 automatically correct the entire image 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.460
 but really only the area you 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.410
 here 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.889
 with her mouse or with her tool 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.750
 have included 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.030
 So you can only parts of the picture 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.340
 But you have to correct one 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.080
 correction of the entire picture on it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.900
 Pay attention that they are really all 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.910
 crooked lines catch all that way 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.289
 The houses are straightened here 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.630
 left and right now I will be without 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.889
 pull on the printed shift key because 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.710
 they should not be in one 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.530
 horizontal or vertical forced 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:02.919
 are just straightened 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:05.530
 So I'll pull the last one 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.720
 edge here with pressed shift button 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.440
 down so that this too 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.510
 is corrected 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.210
 and then we have the picture on one 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.150
 not yet possible art 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.710
 and can equalize 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.410
 I confirm that with ok and then 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.810
 we see that we are in that we enter 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.650
 have used smart optics here 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.230
 correction 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.480
 this elaborate correction in one 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.580
 We saved the smart filter 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.110
 can work around at any time 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.880
 example, not satisfied 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.570
 right-hand side towards 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.400
 correct 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:45.220
 I go again with a double-click 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.220
 on this adaptive wide-angle correction 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.630
 Now pull the gutter here and 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.070
 if I forgot the shift now 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.840
 I can also pull a button 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.910
 Afterwards simply again at this 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.950
 edit points now 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.750
 pull the shift button and it will 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.450
 automatically put straight and the 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.220
 Correction is retraced 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.770
 as well as I can existing ones 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.120
 Just click on corrections again 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.120
 and at these points here in the angle 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.120
 change 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.440
 with the adaptive wide-angle correction 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.539
 So these are extreme changes 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.180
 existing perspectives and 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:29.009
 distortions possible their correction 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.009
 strength you can determine yourself
