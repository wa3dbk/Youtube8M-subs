00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
which there's enough shows that we could

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
shoot all the time I guess designing you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.090 
shoot all the time I guess designing you
know<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> show<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.110> putting<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.470> together<00:01:19.590> and
