hi<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.010> recording<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:02.939> response<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hi I'm recording this video response to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi I'm recording this video response to
a<00:00:03.870> question<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:04.740> got<00:00:04.950> today

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
a question I got today

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.379 
a question I got today
under<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> parallel-park<00:00:07.200> video<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
under the parallel-park video and the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.790 
under the parallel-park video and the
question<00:00:09.990> really<00:00:10.139> couldn't<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> answered

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
question really couldn't be answered

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.539 
question really couldn't be answered
succinctly<00:00:11.790> enough<00:00:12.150> within<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.549> space

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
succinctly enough within the space

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.680 
succinctly enough within the space
available<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.809> comments<00:00:16.770> page<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
available on on the comments page so the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
available on on the comments page so the
question<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.260> should<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> clutch<00:00:20.279> only<00:00:20.730> be

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
question was should the clutch only be

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.300 
question was should the clutch only be
used<00:00:21.150> during<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.960> parallel<00:00:22.529> park<00:00:22.800> maneuver

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
used during the parallel park maneuver

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.250 
used during the parallel park maneuver
or<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.449> matter<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.960> any<00:00:25.050> other

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
or for that matter in any other

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.060 
or for that matter in any other
maneuvers<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.550> gas<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.859> now<00:00:28.859> when<00:00:29.039> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
maneuvers or the gas as well now when I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.970 
maneuvers or the gas as well now when I
teach<00:00:29.340> my<00:00:29.580> pupils<00:00:30.150> always<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.840> sit<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.769> goes

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
teach my pupils always to sit there goes

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.660 
teach my pupils always to sit there goes
the<00:00:32.160> cat

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.000 

when<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> teach<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.210> pupils<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> teach<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.500> if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
when I teach my pupils I teach that if

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
when I teach my pupils I teach that if
they<00:00:41.280> need<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.760> clutch<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.840> would

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they need the clutch then they would

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.880 
they need the clutch then they would
need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> set<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> gas<00:00:44.040> first<00:00:45.590> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> don't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
need to set the gas first if you don't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
need to set the gas first if you don't
need<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.370> clutch<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.629> probably

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
need the clutch then you will probably

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
need the clutch then you will probably
be<00:00:49.079> using<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.620> brake<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.160> control<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> speed

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
be using the brake to control the speed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
be using the brake to control the speed
of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> car<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.699> amount<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.690> gas<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.620> use

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
of the car the amount of gas that we use

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
of the car the amount of gas that we use
will<00:00:56.160> depend<00:00:56.550> upon<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> circumstances<00:00:57.920> for

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
will depend upon the circumstances for

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
will depend upon the circumstances for
instance<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> flat<00:01:00.270> road<00:01:00.510> then

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
instance if you're on a flat road then

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
instance if you're on a flat road then
just<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> normal<00:01:02.010> amount<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> gas<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
just the normal amount of gas will be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
just the normal amount of gas will be
required<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> nice<00:01:04.680> gentle<00:01:04.979> hum

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
required so you get a nice gentle hum

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
required so you get a nice gentle hum
coming<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> engine<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.290> car's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
coming from the engine or if your car's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
coming from the engine or if your car's
a<00:01:07.650> rev<00:01:07.890> counter<00:01:07.920> you'll<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.760> revving<00:01:09.689> at

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a rev counter you'll be revving at

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.370 
a rev counter you'll be revving at
around<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.350> 1,500<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.189> 2,000<00:01:11.880> revs<00:01:12.380> if

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
around about 1,500 to 2,000 revs if

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
around about 1,500 to 2,000 revs if
you're<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.860> uphill<00:01:14.150> then<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:15.450> need

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you're going uphill then you will need

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.640 
you're going uphill then you will need
more<00:01:15.840> gas<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> will<00:01:17.220> need<00:01:17.780> about<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
more gas and you will need about two to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
more gas and you will need about two to
two<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.009> half<00:01:20.130> thousand<00:01:20.670> revs<00:01:20.850> perhaps<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
two and a half thousand revs perhaps and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
two and a half thousand revs perhaps and
you'll<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> louder<00:01:22.530> noise<00:01:22.710> coming<00:01:23.310> from

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you'll get a louder noise coming from

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.140 
you'll get a louder noise coming from
the<00:01:23.490> engine<00:01:24.560> if<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.009> downhill<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the engine if you're going downhill and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
the engine if you're going downhill and
of<00:01:27.330> course<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> vote<00:01:27.780> need<00:01:27.930> any<00:01:28.080> gas<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
of course you vote need any gas and the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
of course you vote need any gas and the
class<00:01:29.040> could<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.310> fully<00:01:29.640> depressed<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
class could be fully depressed and you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.060 
class could be fully depressed and you
will<00:01:30.540> control<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> car<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> foot

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
will control the car just with the foot

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.600 
will control the car just with the foot
brake<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> when<00:01:34.799> you're<00:01:34.920> controlling<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
brake now when you're controlling the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
brake now when you're controlling the
car<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.180> slow<00:01:36.540> speeds<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.350> maneuvers<00:01:37.890> such

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
car at slow speeds from maneuvers such

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
car at slow speeds from maneuvers such
as<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> parallel<00:01:38.700> park<00:01:39.409> generally<00:01:40.409> you'll<00:01:40.590> be

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
as the parallel park generally you'll be

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
as the parallel park generally you'll be
on<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> flat<00:01:41.159> road<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:41.939> set<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> normal

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on a flat road that's so set the normal

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.819 
on a flat road that's so set the normal
amount<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.229> gas

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
amount of gas

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.270 
amount of gas
once<00:01:44.790> you've<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> gas<00:01:45.649> find<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> biting

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
once you've set the gas find the biting

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640 
once you've set the gas find the biting
point<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.119> only<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.810> low<00:01:49.020> biting<00:01:49.560> point

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
point but only a very low biting point

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.530 
point but only a very low biting point
this<00:01:51.250> will<00:01:51.490> give<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.790> much<00:01:52.000> better<00:01:52.210> control

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
this will give you much better control

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.080 
this will give you much better control
of<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> speed<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.560> car<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.760> will<00:01:54.910> be

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
of the speed of the car and you will be

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.940 
of the speed of the car and you will be
able<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.420> use<00:01:55.540> just<00:01:55.570> very<00:01:55.990> small<00:01:56.290> movements<00:01:56.830> of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
able to use just very small movements of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.820 
able to use just very small movements of
the<00:01:57.070> clutch<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.150> ever<00:01:58.420> move<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.930> car<00:01:59.170> or<00:01:59.470> get

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
the clutch so I ever move the car or get

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.150 
the clutch so I ever move the car or get
the<00:02:00.010> car<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.460> slow<00:02:00.730> down<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.620> don't<00:02:02.830> set

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
the car to slow down if you don't set

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.970 
the car to slow down if you don't set
the<00:02:03.340> gas<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.720> will<00:02:04.870> need<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> higher<00:02:05.560> bite

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
the gas then you will need a higher bite

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.370 
the gas then you will need a higher bite
to<00:02:06.400> get<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> car<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.090> movement<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:08.140> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
to get the car to movement and that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.320 
to get the car to movement and that
higher<00:02:08.619> bite<00:02:09.010> will<00:02:09.340> give<00:02:09.460> you<00:02:09.580> less<00:02:09.790> control

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
higher bite will give you less control

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.350 
higher bite will give you less control
over<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.869> car<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:12.160> may<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.580> fact<00:02:12.640> result

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
over the car and it may in fact result

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.300 
over the car and it may in fact result
in<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> car<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:14.050> faster<00:02:14.620> than<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.890> want<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
in the car going faster than you want it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.520 
in the car going faster than you want it
to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.200 
to
now<00:02:17.530> when<00:02:17.740> you're<00:02:17.920> doing<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.280> maneuver<00:02:18.790> they

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
now when you're doing the maneuver they

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.720 
now when you're doing the maneuver they
may<00:02:19.420> come<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> stage<00:02:20.050> when<00:02:20.740> as<00:02:21.100> you've<00:02:21.400> reversed

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
may come a stage when as you've reversed

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.120 
may come a stage when as you've reversed
near<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.270> curb<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.050> car<00:02:23.320> will<00:02:23.530> start<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.920> roll

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
near the curb the car will start to roll

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.360 
near the curb the car will start to roll
down<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.610> camber<00:02:25.090> when<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> does<00:02:26.470> push<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
down the camber when it does push the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.790 
down the camber when it does push the
clutch<00:02:27.550> down<00:02:27.850> fully<00:02:28.210> and<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:29.050> use<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.590> foot

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
clutch down fully and then use the foot

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.540 
clutch down fully and then use the foot
brake<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.220> control<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.790> car<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> find

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
brake to control the car what I find

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.270 
brake to control the car what I find
that<00:02:33.730> clients<00:02:34.210> sometimes<00:02:34.690> try<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:34.990> do<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.710> they

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
that clients sometimes try to do is they

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.430 
that clients sometimes try to do is they
bring<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.640> clutch<00:02:36.850> up<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.210> biting<00:02:37.630> point<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bring the clutch up to biting point and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.070 
bring the clutch up to biting point and
then<00:02:39.100> because<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> car<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.090> too<00:02:40.300> fast

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
then because the car is going too fast

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560 
then because the car is going too fast
that<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> they<00:02:41.860> haven't<00:02:42.070> set<00:02:42.340> any<00:02:42.520> gas<00:02:42.730> they

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
that is they haven't set any gas they

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.810 
that is they haven't set any gas they
then<00:02:43.870> use<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.410> foot<00:02:44.650> brake<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.220> control<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
then use the foot brake to control the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.150 
then use the foot brake to control the
speed<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.300> car<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> end<00:02:47.710> up<00:02:47.860> with

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
speed of the car and so you end up with

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.490 
speed of the car and so you end up with
the<00:02:48.610> clutch<00:02:48.880> wanting<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.390> car<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the clutch wanting the car to go and the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
the clutch wanting the car to go and the
brake<00:02:50.710> trying<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.220> slow<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.700> car<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.150> one<00:02:52.360> is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
brake trying to slow the car so one is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.870 
brake trying to slow the car so one is
fighting<00:02:52.750> against<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> other<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.670> much

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
fighting against the other it's a much

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.449 
fighting against the other it's a much
better<00:02:55.120> procedure<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:56.050> set<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.500> gas<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.980> get

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
better procedure to set the gas and get

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
better procedure to set the gas and get
the<00:02:57.640> amount<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.030> bite<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.600> need<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.530> get

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
the amount of bite that you need to get

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.890 
the amount of bite that you need to get
the<00:02:59.800> car<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.160> move<00:03:00.310> very<00:03:00.640> slowly<00:03:01.030> throughout

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
the car to move very slowly throughout

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.580 
the car to move very slowly throughout
