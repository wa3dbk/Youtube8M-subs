00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.500 
this way this way he won't die which is
great<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.120> mean<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.660> don't<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.500> when<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:31.709> die

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

obviously<00:02:33.510> no<00:02:33.720> one<00:02:33.930> likes<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.709> die

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
obviously no one likes it when we die

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.830 
obviously no one likes it when we die
alright<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.380> he's<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.709> level<00:02:38.010> 10<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.600> right<00:02:39.810> off

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
alright so he's at level 10 so right off

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
alright so he's at level 10 so right off
the<00:02:39.959> bat<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.680> leveled<00:02:40.980> him<00:02:41.160> up<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.550> level

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the bat we just leveled him up at level

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.430 
the bat we just leveled him up at level
10<00:02:42.150> he's<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:42.830> 206<00:02:43.830> attack<00:02:44.670> force<00:02:45.030> attack

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
10 he's it has 206 attack force attack

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.590 
10 he's it has 206 attack force attack
260<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.650> his<00:02:47.280> energy<00:02:47.700> attack<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.150> higher<00:02:48.360> than

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
260 so his energy attack is higher than

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.710 
260 so his energy attack is higher than
his<00:02:48.660> regular<00:02:49.170> attack<00:02:49.470> defense<00:02:50.040> power<00:02:50.720> 160

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
his regular attack defense power 160

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.890 
his regular attack defense power 160
force<00:02:51.989> defense<00:02:53.060> 184<00:02:54.350> health<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.880> HP<00:02:57.360> health

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
force defense 184 health is or HP health

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.949 
force defense 184 health is or HP health
points<00:02:58.730> 836<00:03:02.330> let's<00:03:03.330> swap<00:03:03.600> him<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.019> here<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.959> do

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
get set it onto autopilot for a while

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:18.569

then<00:03:55.290> we'll<00:03:55.470> come<00:03:55.650> back<00:03:55.830> with<00:03:56.040> venom

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.890 

alright<00:04:19.579> let's<00:04:19.760> swap<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.150> venom<00:04:20.450> now<00:04:20.630> there

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
alright let's swap the venom now there

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.670 
alright let's swap the venom now there
he<00:04:21.109> is<00:04:21.730> and<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:23.750> zoom<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:26.080> this<00:04:27.080> what<00:04:27.290> he<00:04:27.410> looks

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
he is and to zoom in this what he looks

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.450 
he is and to zoom in this what he looks
like<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.160> his<00:04:28.370> stance<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:29.060> guess<00:04:29.240> how<00:04:29.390> he<00:04:29.450> runs

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
like the his stance I guess how he runs

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460 
like the his stance I guess how he runs
he's<00:04:31.460> relatively<00:04:32.120> slow<00:04:32.450> in<00:04:32.720> terms<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.140> attack

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
he's relatively slow in terms of attack

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:42.220 
he's relatively slow in terms of attack
you<00:04:33.710> noticed<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:41.210> he<00:04:41.360> lunges<00:04:41.810> at<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
you noticed that so he lunges at you

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.500 
you noticed that so he lunges at you
that's<00:04:42.440> one<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.830> his<00:04:42.980> attacks<00:04:43.400> which<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.270> think

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
that's one of his attacks which I think

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.290 
that's one of his attacks which I think
is<00:04:44.630> weak<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.200> mean<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.130> know<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.760> takes<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.150> while

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
is weak I mean you know it takes a while

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.630 
is weak I mean you know it takes a while
to<00:04:47.360> lunge<00:04:47.750> at<00:04:47.990> you

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
to lunge at you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.260 
to lunge at you
second<00:04:49.640> attack<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:50.150> course<00:04:50.330> there<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.780> is

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.880 

again<00:04:56.270> he<00:04:56.690> lunges<00:04:57.080> at<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.710> hits

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
again he lunges at you and it hits

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.650 
again he lunges at you and it hits
multiple<00:04:58.220> targets<00:05:00.910> anyways<00:05:01.910> that<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.180> pretty

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
multiple targets anyways that is pretty

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.240 
multiple targets anyways that is pretty
much<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:03.050> we<00:05:03.169> can<00:05:03.320> only<00:05:03.350> look<00:05:03.680> at<00:05:03.830> his<00:05:03.950> two<00:05:04.160> of

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
much it we can only look at his two of

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.010
