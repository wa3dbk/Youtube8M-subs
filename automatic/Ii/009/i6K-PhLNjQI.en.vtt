chance<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.259> Hong<00:01:07.410> Kong<00:01:07.649> however<00:01:08.070> obviously<00:01:08.550> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
chance in Hong Kong however obviously a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
chance in Hong Kong however obviously a
few<00:01:09.600> flew<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.410> that<00:01:10.649> it's<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.860> our

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
few flew over but now that it's in our

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.350 
few flew over but now that it's in our
home<00:01:11.100> country<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.940> bit<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> pressure

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
home country there is a bit of pressure

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
home country there is a bit of pressure
but<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.470> we've<00:01:13.920> trained<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.279 
but I think we've trained to that you
know<00:01:14.729> we've<00:01:15.180> had<00:01:15.210> preparations<00:01:15.930> knowing<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
know we've had preparations knowing that

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.630 
know we've had preparations knowing that
even<00:01:16.440> though<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.800> at<00:01:16.890> our<00:01:16.920> home<00:01:17.130> country<00:01:17.399> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
even though it's at our home country you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
even though it's at our home country you
know<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.940> still<00:01:18.180> were<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> play<00:01:18.539> to<00:01:18.990> our

but<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.930> seems<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
but not now seems this you have got on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
but not now seems this you have got on
those<00:01:42.180> guys<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.960> made<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> even

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
those guys that have just made it even

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.010 
those guys that have just made it even
bigger<00:01:43.770> look<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.970> brute<00:01:45.240> strength<00:01:45.390> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
bigger look just that brute strength but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.120 
bigger look just that brute strength but
I<00:01:46.080> think<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.409> we've<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.979> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I think that we've got that we just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.890 
I think that we've got that we just
didn't<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.430> last<00:01:47.700> year<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.750> learned

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
didn't have last year well we learned

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.289 
didn't have last year well we learned
from<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> tournament<00:01:49.560> last<00:01:49.860> year<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:51.119> we

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
from the tournament last year was we

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.870 
from the tournament last year was we
have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.600> accurate<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.369> little

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
have to be accurate and just little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.660 
have to be accurate and just little
mental<00:01:54.360> lapse<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.080> had<00:01:55.340> put<00:01:56.340> us<00:01:56.490> on

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
mental lapse is that we had put us on

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
mental lapse is that we had put us on
the<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:57.030> foot<00:01:57.330> against<00:01:57.750> Korea<00:01:58.229> where<00:01:58.530> we

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the back foot against Korea where we

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.819 
the back foot against Korea where we
really<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.509> in<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.689> position<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.350> take<00:02:01.560> over

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
really were in a position to take over

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.880 
really were in a position to take over
that<00:02:01.979> game<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.630> year<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.049> really<00:02:04.439> focused

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that game so this year we really focused

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.819 
that game so this year we really focused
on<00:02:05.030> being<00:02:06.030> sharp<00:02:06.509> being<00:02:07.079> accurate<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.680> how<00:02:07.770> we

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
on being sharp being accurate and how we

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.180 
on being sharp being accurate and how we
play<00:02:08.190> how<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:08.610> train<00:02:09.119> how<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.810> eat<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:11.009> way

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
play how we train how we eat that way

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979 
play how we train how we eat that way
when<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.700> comes<00:02:11.940> game<00:02:12.209> day<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> only<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.840> 80

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
when it comes game day you only have 80

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.130 
when it comes game day you only have 80
minutes<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.680> prove<00:02:14.430> what<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.940> got<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.570> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
minutes to prove what you got so you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.479 
minutes to prove what you got so you
have<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.350> make<00:02:16.470> every<00:02:16.769> one<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.010> those<00:02:17.070> minutes

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
have to make every one of those minutes

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.229 
have to make every one of those minutes
count<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:19.190> April<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.370> Manila<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.910> very

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
count I think April in Manila is very

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.600 
count I think April in Manila is very
hot<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> be<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.549> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
hot so I think that's going to be one of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.009 
hot so I think that's going to be one of
the<00:02:23.700> toughest<00:02:24.090> things<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.570> obviously

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
the toughest things and obviously

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.890 
the toughest things and obviously
playing<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.500> three<00:02:25.769> games<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> week<00:02:27.180> we're

playing the three games in a week we're
not<00:02:28.019> used<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.680> mean<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.040> know<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.280> have

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
changed the format usually it's just the
