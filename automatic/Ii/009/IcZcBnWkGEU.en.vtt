00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
creating and I'm going to be looking for
specific<00:01:39.420> class<00:01:39.659> items<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.380> could<00:01:40.530> only

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
specific class items that you could only

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
specific class items that you could only
get<00:01:40.979> between<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> levels<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.909> 1<00:01:42.240> through<00:01:42.810> 9

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
get between the levels of 1 through 9

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
get between the levels of 1 through 9
while<00:01:43.320> opening<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> blue<00:01:44.280> class<00:01:44.820> Ingram's

while opening a blue class Ingram's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300 
while opening a blue class Ingram's
that's<00:01:46.140> why<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.380> saving<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.280> I

that's why I'm saving these so when I
create<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.759> Titan<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.500> ready<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
create my Titan I have them ready so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.920 
create my Titan I have them ready so
hopefully<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.090> explained<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.780> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
10,000 plating my weapon parts have been

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.410 
10,000 plating my weapon parts have been
dropping<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> lot<00:02:49.110> I've<00:02:49.230> been<00:02:49.320> reforging<00:02:50.420> next

dropping a lot I've been reforging next
off<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.810> see<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> shade<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> have

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
off you can see the shade is that I have

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.100 
off you can see the shade is that I have
I<00:02:53.280> believe<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.180> bunch<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.750> orbit

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
I believe I have a bunch of that orbit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.930 
I believe I have a bunch of that orbit
shade<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.830> orbit<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.820> that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
shade is this is that orbit this is that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.660 
shade is this is that orbit this is that
orbit<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.930> orbit<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.890> that's<00:02:59.489> not

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
orbit this is that orbit and that's not

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.640 
orbit this is that orbit and that's not
that<00:02:59.790> orbit<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.070> malviya<00:03:02.580> probably

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
that orbit I have a malviya probably

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.520 
that orbit I have a malviya probably
yep<00:03:04.099> right<00:03:04.459> there<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.780> have<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.349> many

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
yep right there I just have so many

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
yep right there I just have so many
shaders<00:03:07.040> also<00:03:07.459> got<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.700> delete<00:03:07.939> them<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> lot<00:03:08.329> of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
shaders also got to delete them a lot of

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.270 
shaders also got to delete them a lot of
them<00:03:08.540> are<00:03:08.659> repeating<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.829> I'll<00:03:09.920> worry<00:03:10.159> about

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
them are repeating but I'll worry about

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.509 
them are repeating but I'll worry about
that<00:03:10.519> later<00:03:11.200> ships<00:03:12.200> look<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.129> a<00:03:13.159> mess

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
that later ships look like a mess

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.039 
that later ships look like a mess
everything's<00:03:14.090> looking<00:03:14.209> like<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> mess<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
everything's looking like a mess and

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.630 
everything's looking like a mess and
another<00:03:15.260> cool<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.560> about<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.069> software<00:03:16.549> is

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
another cool thing about the software is

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.800 
another cool thing about the software is
that<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.849> can<00:03:16.970> also<00:03:17.120> check<00:03:17.360> out<00:03:17.540> your

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
that you can also check out your

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.140 
that you can also check out your
postmaster<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.220> instead<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:19.730> signing<00:03:20.060> on

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
postmaster so instead of like signing on

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.440 
postmaster so instead of like signing on
to<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.359> character<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.670> postmaster

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
to a character going to the postmaster

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.880 
to a character going to the postmaster
and<00:03:23.659> then<00:03:23.780> check<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.079> if<00:03:24.170> he<00:03:24.260> has<00:03:24.379> any<00:03:24.590> items

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
and then check in if he has any items

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.380 
and then check in if he has any items
for<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.489> come<00:03:25.609> on<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.819> website<00:03:26.209> and
