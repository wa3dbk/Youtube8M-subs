00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
just something that she would have liked
to<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.549> happen<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> looked<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to have happen but it looked like a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
to have happen but it looked like a
repressed<00:01:40.350> memory<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.299> only

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
repressed memory so that's the only

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.240 
repressed memory so that's the only
thing<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> fact<00:01:43.200> did<00:01:43.530> she<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
thing is when in fact did she get to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.139 
thing is when in fact did she get to

Sheen's<00:03:10.860> I'd<00:03:11.160> really<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.610> them<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.850> have

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
Sheen's I'd really like for them to have

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.300

the same names as 101 Dalmatians but I

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.370 
the same names as 101 Dalmatians but I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
doubt that it's that perfect but just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.360 
doubt that it's that perfect but just
thought<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.860> coming<00:03:20.220> back

thought so then we have the coming back

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.670 
thought so then we have the coming back
to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.580> village<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.239> run<00:03:21.390> into<00:03:21.540> Choji<00:03:22.470> and
