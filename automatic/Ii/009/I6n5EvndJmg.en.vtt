00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.699
 wait for the farm of six soldiers it is good to live to be pigs for his 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.159
 300 residents 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.509
 it must be said that the program has not changed for ten years lazing about the 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 straw and the world is rising 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.759
 I do not know if it changes the look 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.179
 but good for 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.170
 who said that if I did not want to tickle me I do not want to project myself like that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.980
 but I think that actually an abandoned animal who see the light of the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.760
 day 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.430
 and here who sees the sun that sees the sun a little on his skin and that his 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 theory I think it's going to do him good we come out various 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.650
 it must do him good too there is no reason all here the conditions 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.900
 of life are pitiful the building is open 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.660
 she's the size I'm alone unlike the police a shot the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.449
 animals are paid in sharp decline 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.069
 tight against each other in the dark and without spaces this model 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.079
 of pig breeding and respectful of the animal it seduces the ministries of 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.500
 agriculture and which has awarded him this year the trophies of 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.060
 sustainable agriculture 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.250
 it is true that it is a sign of recognition and 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 and which for me too a clear communication subject of which you are 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440
 there today so much better jeans 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.970
 personal sensitivity this moment already 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.760
 originally to environmental issues 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.570
 if I needed to insert my country work 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.080
 for the missing society that surround me in the daytime projection 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 in any case 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030
 here it is I think that the agricultural world needs to evolve a little bit 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.900
 I needed to register in there simply so 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 here it is I need to be a peasant accepted today I have the chance 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.909
 to be at peace they accepted for his formidable so 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 if I did a job that was based only on the price 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.220
 she owes her appointment 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 ferrand 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 in europe and here we were talking about prices but it turns out that there 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160
 no content 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.550
 we talk about his childhood we try to make sense of what we do 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.350
 and it must be known in the time we have it is thanks to the trophy 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.570
 you're here finally and that's good and we need it 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.210
 the saddle 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 less stressed animals 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.909
 fed on cereals without pesticides today thierry spas and 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.109
 d'isÃ¨re is one of the few publishers 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.909
 to ensure a balance between tradition and secondly to live 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.059
