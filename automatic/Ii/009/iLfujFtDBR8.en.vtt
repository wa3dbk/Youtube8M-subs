00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
paper I'm using I started drawing it

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.259 
paper I'm using I started drawing it
with<00:03:35.870> my<00:03:36.109> red<00:03:36.530> cool<00:03:36.799> erase<00:03:37.269> prismacolor

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
with my red cool erase prismacolor

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.839 
with my red cool erase prismacolor
pencil<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.139> because<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.430> draw<00:03:40.579> with

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
pencil just because I like to draw with

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.710 
pencil just because I like to draw with
that<00:03:41.030> color<00:03:41.329> code<00:03:41.780> pencil<00:03:42.169> um<00:03:42.680> as<00:03:43.639> I<00:03:44.209> sketched

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
that color code pencil um as I sketched

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.659 
that color code pencil um as I sketched
that<00:03:44.959> in<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.530> if<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.739> sketch<00:03:46.040> lightly<00:03:46.519> with

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
that in and if you sketch lightly with

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.280 
that in and if you sketch lightly with
it<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:47.150> erases<00:03:47.660> really<00:03:47.900> nicely<00:03:48.079> if<00:03:48.230> you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
it it all erases really nicely if you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.690 
it it all erases really nicely if you
push<00:03:48.500> really<00:03:48.709> hard<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.250> kind<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.519> doesn't

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
push really hard it kind of doesn't

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.330 
push really hard it kind of doesn't
erase<00:03:50.000> too<00:03:50.299> much<00:03:50.480> but<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.739> long<00:03:51.859> as<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.069> sketch

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
erase too much but as long as you sketch

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.129 
erase too much but as long as you sketch
lightly<00:03:52.669> with<00:03:52.849> it<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.419> a<00:03:53.510> good<00:03:53.660> pencil<00:03:53.989> to

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
lightly with it it's a good pencil to

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.920 
lightly with it it's a good pencil to
use<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.889> playing<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.489> sketches<00:03:55.880> then<00:03:56.750> I

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
use for just playing and sketches then I

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.400 
use for just playing and sketches then I
think<00:03:57.200> this<00:03:57.829> drawing<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.609> using<00:03:59.269> my<00:03:59.410> Sakura

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
think this drawing in using my Sakura

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.050 
think this drawing in using my Sakura
micron<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.400> use<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:01.790> zero<00:04:02.389> three<00:04:02.900> nib<00:04:03.440> size

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
micron and I use a zero three nib size

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
micron and I use a zero three nib size
which<00:04:05.060> gives<00:04:05.299> me<00:04:05.389> a<00:04:05.450> nice<00:04:05.630> size<00:04:05.930> line<00:04:06.319> not<00:04:06.799> too

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
which gives me a nice size line not too

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.710 
which gives me a nice size line not too
thin<00:04:07.220> not<00:04:07.250> too<00:04:07.459> thick<00:04:07.609> that's<00:04:08.329> I<00:04:08.540> think<00:04:08.599> my

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
thin not too thick that's I think my

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.659 
thin not too thick that's I think my
favorite<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.380> emphasizes<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.160> zero<00:04:10.400> three

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
favorite and emphasizes the zero three

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.020 
favorite and emphasizes the zero three
and<00:04:11.680> then<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.799> course<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:12.980> color<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.669> in<00:04:13.910> am

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and then of course to color this in am

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.580 
and then of course to color this in am

there and then every once in a while
you'll<00:04:28.919> see<00:04:29.009> kind<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.550> this<00:04:29.759> clear<00:04:30.210> one<00:04:30.539> and

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.939 
of those videos to your heart's content
but<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:09.120> find<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.960> was<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.259> much<00:05:10.349> fun<00:05:10.409> to<00:05:10.710> do<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
but I find it was so much fun to do the

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.689 
but I find it was so much fun to do the
hair<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.659> started<00:05:12.960> off<00:05:13.080> with<00:05:13.979> like<00:05:14.490> a

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
hair and I started off with like a

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.330 
hair and I started off with like a
lighter<00:05:15.120> highlight<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.740> hair<00:05:16.919> so<00:05:17.099> I<00:05:17.159> used

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
lighter highlight to the hair so I used

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.820 
lighter highlight to the hair so I used
to<00:05:17.460> like<00:05:17.849> a<00:05:17.879> lavender<00:05:18.569> to<00:05:19.319> kind<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.560> highlight

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
to like a lavender to kind of highlight

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.809 
to like a lavender to kind of highlight
and<00:05:20.219> then<00:05:20.400> pulled<00:05:20.759> in<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.659> black<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:23.580> kind<00:05:23.759> of

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
and then pulled in the black to kind of

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.219 
and then pulled in the black to kind of
put<00:05:23.969> in<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> shading<00:05:24.509> so<00:05:24.659> it's<00:05:24.780> kind<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.050> like

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
put in the shading so it's kind of like

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.550 
put in the shading so it's kind of like
