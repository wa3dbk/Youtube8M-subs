myself<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.360> Ian<00:00:32.360> I<00:00:32.540> think<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:32.989> we<00:00:33.170> had<00:00:33.290> only

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
myself and Ian I think that we had only

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.910 
myself and Ian I think that we had only
two<00:00:33.680> survivors<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.840> Huey<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.140> who<00:00:36.620> he<00:00:36.770> was

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
two survivors and Huey and who he was

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.650 
two survivors and Huey and who he was
Huey's<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:37.699> leave<00:00:38.470> so<00:00:39.470> with<00:00:40.400> that's<00:00:40.670> why<00:00:40.940> the

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
Huey's on leave so with that's why the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.250 
Huey's on leave so with that's why the
new<00:00:42.500> boys<00:00:42.739> were<00:00:43.210> flying<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:44.809> why<00:00:44.989> they<00:00:45.170> were

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
new boys were flying and why they were

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.340 
new boys were flying and why they were
flying<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.710> soon<00:00:45.920> because<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:46.309> were<00:00:47.260> weird<00:00:48.260> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
flying so soon because we were weird of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.870 
flying so soon because we were weird of
shorter<00:00:48.680> aircraft<00:00:49.040> sort<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.399> people<00:00:49.670> ever

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
shorter aircraft sort of people ever

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.770 
shorter aircraft sort of people ever
else<00:00:50.120> we<00:00:50.809> flew<00:00:51.020> around<00:00:51.110> 25<00:00:51.680> because<00:00:51.920> the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
else we flew around 25 because the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.240 
else we flew around 25 because the
measurement<00:00:53.780> have<00:00:54.469> an<00:00:54.620> automatic

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
measurement have an automatic

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.600 
measurement have an automatic
transmission<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.750> shifted<00:00:57.320> pitch<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.920> oh

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
transmission you it shifted pitch and oh

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.790 
transmission you it shifted pitch and oh
it's<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.879> gear<00:00:59.120> shift<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.600> it<00:01:00.290> was<00:01:00.379> automatic

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
it's a gear shift and it was automatic

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.459 
it's a gear shift and it was automatic
at<00:01:01.070> 24,000<00:01:01.969> feet<00:01:02.059> didn't<00:01:02.360> kick<00:01:02.540> in<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.809> note<00:01:03.020> at

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
at 24,000 feet didn't kick in a note at

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.740 
at 24,000 feet didn't kick in a note at
that<00:01:03.710> level<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.220> he<00:01:04.399> and<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.759> could<00:01:04.910> and<00:01:05.119> when

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
that level is he and you could and when

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.930 
that level is he and you could and when
it<00:01:05.899> did<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.680> lost<00:01:07.130> power<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.550> see<00:01:07.910> a

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
it did that they lost power you see a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.330 
it did that they lost power you see a
black<00:01:08.149> puff<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.600> smoke<00:01:08.690> come<00:01:09.020> out<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.310> they

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
black puff of smoke come out and so they

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.820 
black puff of smoke come out and so they
were<00:01:10.610> easy<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:11.780> or<00:01:12.140> easier<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.680> get

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
were easy to get or easier to get

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.190 
were easy to get or easier to get
because<00:01:13.100> they<00:01:13.280> didn't<00:01:13.759> be<00:01:14.030> steep<00:01:14.479> Bank<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.050> we

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
because they didn't be steep Bank and we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.680 
because they didn't be steep Bank and we
pre<00:01:15.470> fly<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.860> 24<00:01:16.369> 25<00:01:16.789> 20<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.390> they'd<00:01:17.660> be

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
pre fly of 24 25 20 and they'd be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.260 
pre fly of 24 25 20 and they'd be
puffing<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.440> out<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.590> see<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.060> we

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
puffing in and out you see and so we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.639 
puffing in and out you see and so we
ever<00:01:20.420> gotten<00:01:20.690> one<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:20.929> those<00:01:21.110> things<00:01:21.410> we

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
ever gotten one of those things we

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.680 
ever gotten one of those things we
usually<00:01:22.610> ended<00:01:22.789> up<00:01:22.910> beginning<00:01:23.209> more<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.539> them

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
usually ended up beginning more of them

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.249 
usually ended up beginning more of them
than<00:01:23.720> they<00:01:23.990> got<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.289> us<00:01:24.910> anyhow<00:01:25.910> we<00:01:26.690> lost<00:01:27.020> these
