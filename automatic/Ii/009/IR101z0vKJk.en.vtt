00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.920
 two 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.630
 beauty corners a monster that the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.380
 of enchantments and then the truth 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's smoke 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 I really liked it not enough but I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.870
 I loved it and liked it so what 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.870
 bring to you and well as you can see 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.110
 that we have this table 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.100
 enchantments that kraft was with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.310
 you call that a book 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 4 of how it is said 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.640
 of triana and therefore to be able to find what 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.340
 What will it be is an instrument with your 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.290
 mind and to do it quickly 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 here we will use a sword to see 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.380
 of what is capable for example if 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 we touch will not appear this that like 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.700
 they have to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 that has the back enchanting then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 acquired 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 I will ask for aspect of the people I think it is 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.890
 that says then we give to enchant and then 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.320
 now let's put it 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 bird 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.090
 this 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 we are going to 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.220
 as you can see the fire is lit 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:41.310
 and everything in your hand but 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.930
 and then they can also take them 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.800
 or they can give you even before it's for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.080
 remove the fire and was also the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.080
 economic does not know what is that 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.300
 let's do it with the devil is that what 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.300
 I knew not always 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.450
 poor as you can see a supposed 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.690
 a bonus , whatever 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 if I were experienced I would be more but 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.560
 is for me this things is fine and not 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.780
 only that we can also have for 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.569
 example a peak sometimes if we find 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.569
 the peak then with the peak 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.060
 in instruments with the peak then we can 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.060
 do as he says 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.250
 this 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.250
 fortune that is what it says 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.050
 how do you say this good I do not know how 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.670
 say it but add more mineral be by 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.730
 example the diamond block we are going to 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.520
 add us a few to see 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.000
 as you know the block d 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 of diamond survey more than one then 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.970
 now not the most appropriate or 3 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.380
 that is called that is the fortune and then the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.180
 I really loved this moment this 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.600
 dow component but instead of one 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.020
 and placed from that normal peak and as 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.130
 can see what is offered I do not know why 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.750
 what did that do and not only that, but 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.240
 can efficiency which is the speed 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.330
 what is going to have 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.600
 we will love everything to see a 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.600
 shit 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.080
 and then if they listen to the touches because 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.610
 I still do not have this microphone because 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.060
 people get into it even if we buy the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.860
 new and then calm that that is not 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.030
 nothing bad and so 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.930
 as you will see now I believe that until here 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.510
 we go fast but yes but I guess I think 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.069
 I do not know 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.790
 that you can not want because because 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.090
 we need stone to stone stones 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.090
 splinter stone 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.320
 and I'm hoping to use a 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.080
 way for a 9.3 and all that because the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.020
 I really had quite a bit after the 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.080
 I like to see and it ends pretty 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.990
 fast and I love that and we are not from 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:30.790
 peak but you can love them from 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.600
 Eastern pigeon iron iron wood 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.600
 this gold 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.919
 ok how can you see our 3t pib is a 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.330
 I really love it I think I would put it 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.500
 series 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.479
 yes but instead of modifying so that 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.009
 sometimes it is done and so be it with the 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:56.249
 experience or that is not spoken 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:00.180
 ok I do not know why half the side 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:03.479
 well let's leave that if this 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.669
 this would not modify to be with 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.440
 experiences that when you kill by 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.320
 example on European yacht experience and 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.940
 so we have to use experience to 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.539
 to be able to sing things all this would be 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.729
 better for good the download link of the 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.580
 world will be in the description and the link 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.850
 from the creator also boyfriend and well I think 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.199
 what is a youtube I do not know the truth 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.490
 because both are committed to subscribe for 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.789
 until next time 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.789
 bye
