00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.520
 I'm not worried 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.910
 this is the note in the file I'm going to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.910
 look at it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.300
 to look at the notes 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.360
 he is wrong 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.670
 6 with 3 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.540
 elsie fuck I have 84 well 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.760
 7 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 what disgust what disgust 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 forever 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 83 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.360
 to look if something happens 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.090
 90 of zinc and you have put a 6 with 3 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 true incredible 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.899
 this has to be told to the delegate 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.899
 this can not be left like this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 to little 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.180
 or loneliness the course came because 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.380
 many students have complained about the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.600
 notes that they have removed because 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.230
 correspond to what the note 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.230
 telephone 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 let's see the notes have been a pact 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.410
 deferred in effectively from 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.810
 a second action of a first 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.240
 simulation of what would have been in 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.270
 deferred but how much against the test 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 with the notes and assigned the notes have 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.380
 been calculated according to the average 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510
 arithmetic along with a weighted average 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.490
 and a Gaussian curve with 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 corresponding percentiles and others 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.230
 statistical criteria that we 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.230
 we do not know 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.960
 good, thank you very much 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 by the way 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.740
 perhaps 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.740
 of the channel note 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.630

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.750
 there is kneading sticking out soon 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.560
 the questions 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.560
 this return 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.489

 75 thousand 425 v drink with 9 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.380
 35 thousand 837 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.710
 25 thousand 837 others 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.160
 25,837 others 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.160
