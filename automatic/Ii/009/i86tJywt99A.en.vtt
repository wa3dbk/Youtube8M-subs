you know we had good energy but

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.849 
you know we had good energy but
execution<00:00:19.009> broke<00:00:19.189> down<00:00:19.400> at<00:00:19.580> times<00:00:19.820> but<00:00:20.859> then

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859

towards his school starts which is the

towards his school starts which is the

towards<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> fatigue<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.320> team<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> mean

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
towards the fatigue of the team I mean

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.840 
towards the fatigue of the team I mean
they've<00:02:15.950> been<00:02:15.980> coming<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.340> here<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.640> 90

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
they've been coming out here in 90

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.130 
they've been coming out here in 90
degree<00:02:17.090> days<00:02:17.300> every<00:02:17.540> single<00:02:17.810> day<00:02:17.930> how's<00:02:18.110> uh

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
degree days every single day how's uh

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.020 
degree days every single day how's uh
how's<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> team<00:02:18.800> holding<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.160> wow<00:02:19.760> they're

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
how's the team holding up wow they're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.060 
how's the team holding up wow they're
fatigued<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.870> by<00:02:21.110> design<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.860> if<00:02:21.920> they

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
fatigued and it's by design and if they

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.650 
fatigued and it's by design and if they
weren't<00:02:22.250> fatigue<00:02:22.670> we'd<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.090> them<00:02:23.240> do<00:02:23.390> even

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
weren't fatigue we'd have them do even

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.680 
weren't fatigue we'd have them do even
more<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.930> mean<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> idea<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:26.240> get<00:02:26.390> folks

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
more I mean the idea is to get folks

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
more I mean the idea is to get folks
fatigued<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.040> learn<00:02:28.220> how<00:02:29.150> hard

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
fatigued and so that they learn how hard

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.120 
fatigued and so that they learn how hard
they<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.690> work<00:02:29.870> everybody<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.680> work<00:02:30.860> harder

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
they can work everybody can work harder

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.220 
they can work everybody can work harder
than<00:02:31.250> they<00:02:31.310> think<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.610> Kim<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:33.110> know

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
than they think that Kim and so you know

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.720 
than they think that Kim and so you know
they<00:02:33.380> need<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> raise<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.860> bar<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.250> discover

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
they need to raise the bar and discover

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.940 
they need to raise the bar and discover
that<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> think<00:02:36.410> we've<00:02:36.590> had<00:02:36.739> good

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
that but I think we've had good

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.740 
that but I think we've had good
competitive<00:02:37.520> work<00:02:37.790> i<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.000> itself<00:02:38.540> in

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
competitive work i think itself in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.449 
competitive work i think itself in
demanding<00:02:39.290> by<00:02:39.470> all<00:02:39.530> accounts<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.190> been

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
demanding by all accounts it's been

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.710 
demanding by all accounts it's been
demanding<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.380> why<00:02:42.620> design<00:02:43.720> have

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
demanding and so that's why design have

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.180 
demanding and so that's why design have
you<00:02:44.840> been<00:02:44.959> happy<00:02:45.260> with<00:02:45.410> two

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
you been happy with two

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.530 
you been happy with two
way<00:02:46.250> Marquis<00:02:46.670> has<00:02:46.940> been<00:02:47.030> able<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.240> maintain

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
way Marquis has been able to maintain

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
way Marquis has been able to maintain
that<00:02:47.960> kind<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.200> physicality<00:02:48.650> we're<00:02:49.070> looking

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that kind of physicality we're looking

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.160 
that kind of physicality we're looking
for<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.520> moment<00:02:49.670> spring<00:02:50.030> he's<00:02:50.810> gotten<00:02:51.140> better

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
for a moment spring he's gotten better

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.840 
for a moment spring he's gotten better
and<00:02:51.500> better<00:02:51.560> Marquis<00:02:52.220> gotten<00:02:52.550> better<00:02:52.670> and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
and better Marquis gotten better and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.780 
and better Marquis gotten better and
better<00:02:52.910> he's<00:02:53.270> really<00:02:53.540> explosive<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.760> he's<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
better he's really explosive and he's a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.640 
better he's really explosive and he's a
fun<00:02:56.120> guy<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.570> practice<00:02:57.230> because<00:02:57.380> he's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
fun guy to have in practice because he's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.100 
fun guy to have in practice because he's
you<00:02:58.340> know<00:02:58.370> he's<00:02:58.730> always<00:02:58.970> loose<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.570> relaxed

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
you know he's always loose and relaxed

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.460 
you know he's always loose and relaxed
and<00:03:00.710> then<00:03:01.460> which<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.270> allows<00:03:02.570> him<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.170> go

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
and then which I think allows him to go

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.080 
and then which I think allows him to go
out<00:03:03.590> there<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.830> make<00:03:04.040> plays<00:03:04.190> because<00:03:04.760> it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
out there and make plays because it's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.150 
out there and make plays because it's
he's<00:03:05.510> never<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.840> guy<00:03:06.020> that's<00:03:06.230> tightened<00:03:06.680> up<00:03:06.830> and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
he's never a guy that's tightened up and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.370 
he's never a guy that's tightened up and
then<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:08.060> know<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.300> he<00:03:08.420> focuses<00:03:09.020> more<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
then you know is he focuses more and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.440 
then you know is he focuses more and
more<00:03:09.560> on<00:03:09.680> his<00:03:09.860> technique<00:03:10.670> things<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.210> that

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
more on his technique things like that

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.510 
more on his technique things like that
you<00:03:12.140> know<00:03:12.230> he<00:03:12.350> steadily<00:03:12.680> improves<00:03:13.250> he's

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
you know he steadily improves he's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.500 
you know he steadily improves he's
better<00:03:13.730> at<00:03:13.790> getting<00:03:14.000> off<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.330> line<00:03:14.360> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.010 
all we recognize that we just throwed
everybody<00:03:59.780> else<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:02.209> don't<00:04:02.300> really<00:04:02.420> mind<00:04:02.750> that

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
everybody else we don't really mind that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.740 
everybody else we don't really mind that
but<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:03.410> also<00:04:04.180> illustrates<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.330> importance

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
but that also illustrates the importance

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.380 
but that also illustrates the importance
of<00:04:06.370> thrown<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.520> everybody<00:04:07.880> having<00:04:08.209> good

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
of thrown to everybody having good

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.800

distribution<00:04:08.720> with<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.530> positions<00:04:10.810> so

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
distribution with all the positions so

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.280 
distribution with all the positions so
much<00:04:11.959> emphasis<00:04:12.380> on<00:04:12.650> your<00:04:13.040> offense<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:13.880> see

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
much emphasis on your offense this see

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.170 
much emphasis on your offense this see
do<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.829> defensive<00:04:15.400> side<00:04:15.969> is

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
do you think the defensive side is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.670 
do you think the defensive side is
getting<00:04:16.299> looked<00:04:16.660> over<00:04:16.840> at<00:04:16.989> all<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.380> little<00:04:17.440> bit

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
getting looked over at all a little bit

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.099 
getting looked over at all a little bit
I<00:04:18.190> do<00:04:18.639> think<00:04:19.030> they<00:04:19.269> are<00:04:19.479> because<00:04:19.690> they<00:04:20.049> were

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
I do think they are because they were

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.770 
I do think they are because they were
they've<00:04:20.350> really<00:04:20.620> done<00:04:20.769> some<00:04:21.009> good<00:04:21.130> things<00:04:21.190> and

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
they've really done some good things and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.850 
they've really done some good things and
you<00:04:22.780> know<00:04:22.900> they<00:04:23.020> put<00:04:23.199> a<00:04:23.229> lot<00:04:23.350> of<00:04:23.410> pressure<00:04:23.710> on

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
you know they put a lot of pressure on

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.400 
you know they put a lot of pressure on
people<00:04:24.660> we've<00:04:25.660> had<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.840> lot<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.050> really<00:04:26.289> good

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
people we've had a lot of really good

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.400 
people we've had a lot of really good
players<00:04:26.590> emerged<00:04:27.160> there<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.199> think

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
players emerged there and and I think

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.260 
players emerged there and and I think
they've<00:04:29.560> had<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.740> really<00:04:29.919> good<00:04:30.130> camp<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:31.180> you
