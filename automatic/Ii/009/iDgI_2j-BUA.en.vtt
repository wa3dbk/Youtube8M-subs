00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
for the movie I think that's what it did

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
for the movie I think that's what it did
but<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> wasn't<00:01:04.050> like<00:01:04.289> everything<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.920> was

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070

hoping<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.789> think<00:01:06.090> this

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
hoping for it because I do think this

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.760 
hoping for it because I do think this
movie<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> great<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.619> don't

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
I do think that this trailer was very

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.970 
I do think that this trailer was very
visually<00:02:16.230> stunning<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.620> well<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
visually stunning as well like the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.100 
visually stunning as well like the
opening<00:02:17.370> shot<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:18.030> visually<00:02:18.540> stunning<00:02:18.810> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
opening shot was visually stunning it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.780 
opening shot was visually stunning it
was<00:02:19.200> amazing<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:20.099> didn't<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.400> too<00:02:20.760> much

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
was amazing but we didn't get too much

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.119 
was amazing but we didn't get too much
out<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.599> what<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.319> actually<00:02:22.650> what's

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
out of like what it's actually what's

what I seems like this is a downtime for

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.670 
what I seems like this is a downtime for
Batman<00:02:29.640> which<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:30.810> Batman's<00:02:31.379> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
Batman which I get because Batman's the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
Batman which I get because Batman's the
you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> his<00:02:32.160> parents<00:02:32.400> died<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.270> front<00:02:33.450> of
