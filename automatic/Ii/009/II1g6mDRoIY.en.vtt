00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.060 
about with the physics engine with a
series<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> weapons<00:00:39.530> again<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.740> very<00:00:40.770> good

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

last<00:00:45.450> video<00:00:45.750> looked<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.050> something<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.470> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
last video looked like something out of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
last video looked like something out of
Destruction<00:00:47.070> Derby<00:00:47.240> this<00:00:48.240> looks<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.690> like

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
Destruction Derby this looks more like

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
Destruction Derby this looks more like
something<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.760> twisted<00:00:50.760> metal<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.360> even

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
something out of twisted metal or even

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.280 
something out of twisted metal or even
vigilante<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.990> same<00:00:55.170> we

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
vigilante a it's just the same we

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.080 
vigilante a it's just the same we
probably<00:00:55.740> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.100> seeing<00:00:56.460> weapons<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
probably would be seeing weapons in the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.800 
probably would be seeing weapons in the
final<00:00:57.450> game<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> enjoy<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> lasts

game<00:06:49.689> and<00:06:52.079> it's<00:06:53.079> made<00:06:53.529> me<00:06:53.619> very<00:06:53.769> much<00:06:53.979> look

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
game and it's made me very much look

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.439 
game and it's made me very much look
forward<00:06:54.189> to<00:06:54.579> the<00:06:54.699> final<00:06:55.029> game<00:06:55.239> the<00:06:57.449> damage

forward to the final game the damage

set the new standard for car damage in

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.249 
set the new standard for car damage in
racing<00:07:03.249> games<00:07:03.429> for<00:07:03.579> the<00:07:03.669> future<00:07:04.059> and<00:07:04.899> it's<00:07:05.049> to

racing games for the future and it's to

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.719 
racing games for the future and it's to
be<00:07:05.289> a<00:07:05.379> similar<00:07:05.739> story<00:07:06.039> for<00:07:06.159> the<00:07:06.279> environment

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:34.730 
it's reduced to rubble I think I took it

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.310 
it's reduced to rubble I think I took it
a<00:07:34.790> bit<00:07:34.910> too<00:07:35.060> far<00:07:35.300> this<00:07:35.450> time<00:07:35.510> where's<00:07:35.840> my<00:07:35.870> PC

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320 
a bit too far this time where's my PC

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.650 
a bit too far this time where's my PC
struggle<00:07:36.710> to<00:07:36.800> cope

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
struggle to cope

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.850

I'll<00:07:38.660> not<00:07:38.810> know<00:07:38.960> that's<00:07:39.200> it<00:07:39.380> for<00:07:39.560> this<00:07:39.650> video

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 
I'll not know that's it for this video

I'll not know that's it for this video
we<00:07:40.760> will<00:07:40.970> be<00:07:41.120> returning<00:07:41.240> to<00:07:41.510> next<00:07:41.780> car<00:07:41.990> game
