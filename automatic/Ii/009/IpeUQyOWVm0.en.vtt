00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.230 

for<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.430> while<00:01:21.730> it's<00:01:22.150> time<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:24.640> car<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.090> can

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
for a while it's time to my car you can

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:35.190 
for a while it's time to my car you can
access<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.810> filter<00:01:33.570> my<00:01:34.570> filter<00:01:34.840> wasn't<00:01:35.140> on

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
access the filter my filter wasn't on

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.410 
access the filter my filter wasn't on
seat<00:01:35.410> height<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:35.830> it's<00:01:36.220> unscrewing<00:01:37.090> pretty

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
seat height so it's unscrewing pretty

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.630 
seat height so it's unscrewing pretty
easily<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.590> again<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.310> want<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.520> make<00:01:39.610> sure

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
easily and again you want to make sure

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.130 
easily and again you want to make sure
the<00:01:39.910> bucket<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.360> directly<00:01:40.600> underneath<00:01:40.900> it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the bucket is directly underneath it

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.170 
the bucket is directly underneath it
because<00:01:41.380> oil<00:01:41.680> will<00:01:42.220> drain<00:01:42.850> out<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:45.180> there

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
because oil will drain out and there

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.050 
because oil will drain out and there
goes<00:01:46.570> into<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.350> bucket<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.580> make<00:01:48.729> sure<00:01:48.760> the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
goes into the bucket so make sure the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:03.570 
goes into the bucket so make sure the
bucket<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.450> there<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.840> catch<00:01:50.020> it<00:02:02.520> before<00:02:03.520> you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
bucket is there to catch it before you

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.830 
bucket is there to catch it before you
put<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.880> new<00:02:04.000> filter<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.540> want<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.750> make

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
put on the new filter you want to make

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
put on the new filter you want to make
sure<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:18.060> spread<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> around<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:21.340> outside<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
sure you spread it around the outside so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.699 
sure you spread it around the outside so
it's<00:02:24.010> nice<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.370> lubed<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:26.230> everything

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
it's nice and lubed like everything

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.640 
it's nice and lubed like everything

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
should be

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.470 
should be
so<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.819> is<00:02:29.030> fully<00:02:29.659> lubed<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:32.090> reach<00:02:32.299> in
