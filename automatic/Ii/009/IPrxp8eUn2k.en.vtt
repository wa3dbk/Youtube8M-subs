in<00:01:25.680> seeing<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> video<00:01:26.820> straight<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.630> how

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
in seeing and video straight to see how

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.039 
in seeing and video straight to see how
it<00:01:28.020> moves<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.840> definitely

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it moves you know it's definitely

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
it moves you know it's definitely
healthy<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> last<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.460> got<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> pressed<00:01:33.000> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
healthy the last time I got it pressed I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
healthy the last time I got it pressed I
think<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.600> over<00:01:33.960> conditioned<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.979> was

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
think I was over conditioned so it was

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.840 
think I was over conditioned so it was
more<00:01:35.790> flyaway<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.130> harder<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> press

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more flyaway and it was harder to press

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
more flyaway and it was harder to press
I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.420> was<00:01:39.630> um<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.140> protein<00:01:40.560> was

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I think it was um the protein was

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
I think it was um the protein was
definitely<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> good<00:01:41.310> addition<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.270> regimen

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
definitely a good addition to my regimen

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
definitely a good addition to my regimen
I'll<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.770> doing<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.130> keratin<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> two-minute

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
I'll be doing a keratin the two-minute

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
I'll be doing a keratin the two-minute
keratin<00:01:45.689> Reconstructor<00:01:46.439> when<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> wash<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
keratin Reconstructor when I wash it
today<00:01:47.850> I'm<00:01:48.149> also<00:01:48.479> seeing<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> shedding

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
today I'm also seeing a lot of shedding

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.810 
today I'm also seeing a lot of shedding
and<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.770> might<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.579> straight

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and it might just be that it's straight

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
and it might just be that it's straight
hair<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.500> I'll<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.040> between<00:01:53.640> F<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> G

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
hair but I'll do that between F and G

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
poke to set protein treatment which I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
poke to set protein treatment which I
did<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.759> first<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> few<00:01:57.540> weeks<00:01:57.719> ago

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
did in my first one a few weeks ago

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.700 
did in my first one a few weeks ago
before<00:01:58.469> getting<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> pressed<00:02:00.350> one<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.530> it's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
before getting it pressed one thing it's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
before getting it pressed one thing it's
funny<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> note<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.579> my<00:02:03.060> hair<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
funny to note is that my hair that is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
funny to note is that my hair that is
straighter<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.500> curly<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> also<00:02:05.549> straight

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
straighter when curly is also straight

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180 
straighter when curly is also straight
or<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.060> pressed<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:07.290> eye<00:02:07.500> takes<00:02:07.799> curls

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
or when pressed this eye takes curls

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.919 
or when pressed this eye takes curls
really<00:02:08.399> well

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
really well

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.960 
really well
pincurls<00:02:09.319> whatever<00:02:09.890> they<00:02:10.310> hold<00:02:10.549> really<00:02:10.819> well

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
pincurls whatever they hold really well

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.300 
pincurls whatever they hold really well
as<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:11.930> see<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.319> side<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.799> kind<00:02:13.159> of

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
as you can see this side is kind of

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.850 
as you can see this side is kind of
curlier<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.970> started<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.629> curl<00:02:15.530> up<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.829> little

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
curlier it started to curl up a little

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.890 
curlier it started to curl up a little
bit<00:02:16.310> from<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:17.180> don't<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.569> if<00:02:17.689> it<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
bit from I don't know if it was the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.319 
bit from I don't know if it was the
steam<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.349> shower<00:02:18.590> or<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.129> this<00:02:19.760> side<00:02:20.000> is

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
steam in the shower or what this side is

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.940 
steam in the shower or what this side is
the<00:02:20.360> straighter<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.319> back<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:21.769> there

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the straighter on the back it's there

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.530 
the straighter on the back it's there
but<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.220> front<00:02:22.549> definitely<00:02:23.239> stayed

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
but the front definitely stayed

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.220 
but the front definitely stayed
straighter<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.349> see<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:26.090> side<00:02:26.689> has<00:02:26.989> more

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
straighter and see it the side has more

waist<00:03:39.379> length<00:03:39.650> again<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.669> weighing

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
waist length again I'm just weighing

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.689 
waist length again I'm just weighing
this<00:03:41.030> before<00:03:41.449> but<00:03:41.859> for<00:03:42.859> those<00:03:43.010> who<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.519> may

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
this before but for those who this may

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:47.140 
this before but for those who this may
be<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.909> first<00:03:44.120> video<00:03:44.389> watching<00:03:45.879> just<00:03:46.879> do<00:03:47.030> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
be the first video watching just do it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.089 
be the first video watching just do it
one<00:03:47.329> more<00:03:47.359> time<00:03:48.099> um<00:03:50.349> again<00:03:51.349> that's<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:51.919> so

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
one more time um again that's just so

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.009 
one more time um again that's just so
longest<00:03:52.519> length<00:03:52.669> you<00:03:52.849> can<00:03:53.000> see<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:53.389> not<00:03:53.599> full

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
longest length you can see it's not full

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.069 
longest length you can see it's not full
thickness<00:03:54.290> at<00:03:54.680> all<00:03:55.180> I'll<00:03:56.180> just<00:03:56.209> pull<00:03:56.629> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
thickness at all I'll just pull the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:06.520 
thickness at all I'll just pull the
sides<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.940> because<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.060> can't<00:04:05.269> really<00:04:06.260> do<00:04:06.379> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
sides so because I can't really do the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.949 
sides so because I can't really do the
back<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.829> my<00:04:06.949> hair<00:04:07.159> with<00:04:07.669> the<00:04:08.419> tape<00:04:08.599> I'll<00:04:08.810> just

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
back of my hair with the tape I'll just

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.409 
back of my hair with the tape I'll just
try<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.139> do<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.440> side<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.919> a<00:04:10.010> line<00:04:10.459> it's<00:04:11.329> about

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
try to do the side in a line it's about

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.789 
try to do the side in a line it's about
22<00:04:11.989> inches<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.739> looks<00:04:12.949> like<00:04:13.449> so<00:04:14.449> take<00:04:15.440> out<00:04:15.620> this

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
22 inches it looks like so take out this

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.979 
22 inches it looks like so take out this
piece

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
piece

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:30.290 
piece
because<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.140> I'm<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.470> pre-poo<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
because then I'm going to pre-poo the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.570 
because then I'm going to pre-poo the
longest<00:04:30.720> piece<00:04:30.930> is<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.380> little<00:04:31.590> bit<00:04:31.860> past<00:04:32.070> 23

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
longest piece is a little bit past 23

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.750 
longest piece is a little bit past 23
inches<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.120> looks<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.630> but<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.470> bulk<00:04:34.890> looks

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
inches it looks like but the bulk looks

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.860 
inches it looks like but the bulk looks
like<00:04:36.060> it's<00:04:36.300> kind<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.780> at<00:04:38.990> 2021<00:04:41.390> you<00:04:42.390> can<00:04:42.540> see<00:04:42.750> it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
like it's kind of at 2021 you can see it

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.510 
like it's kind of at 2021 you can see it
on<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.230> side<00:04:43.530> but<00:04:44.280> I'm<00:04:44.490> down<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:46.250> 23<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.370> those

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
on that side but I'm down to 23 on those

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.800 
on that side but I'm down to 23 on those
little<00:04:47.700> ends<00:04:47.850> I<00:04:48.030> might<00:04:48.300> put<00:04:48.480> my<00:04:48.570> hair<00:04:48.720> and

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
little ends I might put my hair and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.080 
little ends I might put my hair and
twist<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.230> just<00:04:49.410> do<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:49.980> little<00:04:50.220> bit<00:04:50.400> do<00:04:51.060> a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
twist and just do a little bit do a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.070 
twist and just do a little bit do a
little<00:04:51.390> mini<00:04:51.600> trim<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.970> crown<00:04:54.240> area<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.840> my

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
little mini trim the crown area is my

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.930 
little mini trim the crown area is my
shortest<00:04:55.440> area<00:04:55.800> because<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.190> does<00:04:56.370> break<00:04:56.670> off

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
shortest area because it does break off

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.090 
shortest area because it does break off
so<00:04:57.720> I'm<00:04:57.780> gonna<00:04:57.900> try<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.270> from<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:01.830> top

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
so I'm gonna try to do this from the top

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:15.140 
so I'm gonna try to do this from the top
-<00:05:12.230> well<00:05:13.230> actually<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.890> looks<00:05:14.040> like<00:05:14.280> at<00:05:14.550> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
- well actually that looks like at the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.670 
- well actually that looks like at the
thinnest<00:05:15.510> length<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.050> going<00:05:16.260> down<00:05:16.470> to

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
thinnest length it is going down to

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:31.640 
thinnest length it is going down to
about<00:05:16.920> 22<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.820> half<00:05:25.040> that's<00:05:26.930> 20<00:05:27.930> -<00:05:30.290> I'll<00:05:31.290> try

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
about 22 and a half that's 20 - I'll try

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.820 
about 22 and a half that's 20 - I'll try
to<00:05:31.710> do<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.600> little<00:05:33.900> kind<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.200> one<00:05:34.440> little

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
to do that a little kind of one little

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.370 
to do that a little kind of one little
piece<00:05:35.160> we'll<00:05:35.460> see<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:36.630> still<00:05:36.750> from<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.169> roots

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
piece we'll see but still from the roots

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:47.980 
piece we'll see but still from the roots
that's<00:05:37.590> probably<00:05:37.950> going<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.220> be

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.189 

about<00:05:48.680> 22<00:05:49.340> inches<00:05:50.020> 2021

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
about 22 inches 2021

00:05:51.199 --> 00:06:01.030 
about 22 inches 2021
I<00:05:51.229> don't<00:05:51.740> good<00:05:51.979> job<00:05:52.160> this<00:05:52.400> one

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.110 

18:19<00:06:02.040> actually<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.490> is<00:06:02.580> probably<00:06:02.880> where

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
18:19 actually this is probably where

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.030 
18:19 actually this is probably where
it's<00:06:03.660> more<00:06:03.900> broken<00:06:04.200> off<00:06:04.440> it's<00:06:04.620> not<00:06:04.740> so<00:06:04.890> much

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
it's more broken off it's not so much

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.400 
it's more broken off it's not so much
the<00:06:05.160> top<00:06:05.340> layer<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.670> that<00:06:05.970> Center<00:06:06.390> because<00:06:07.260> I

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
the top layer but that Center because I

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.740 
the top layer but that Center because I
it<00:06:07.710> does<00:06:07.890> go<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.070> 21<00:06:08.430> but<00:06:08.610> it's<00:06:08.910> very<00:06:09.240> thin<00:06:09.510> but

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
it does go to 21 but it's very thin but

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.510 
it does go to 21 but it's very thin but
by<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.960> time<00:06:10.140> it<00:06:10.260> gets<00:06:10.350> there<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:13.370> I'll<00:06:14.370> just

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
by the time it gets there and I'll just

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.820 
by the time it gets there and I'll just
do<00:06:14.730> what<00:06:15.300> I'll<00:06:15.390> do<00:06:15.540> is<00:06:15.720> I'll<00:06:15.900> put<00:06:16.110> this<00:06:16.440> from

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
do what I'll do is I'll put this from

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.710 
do what I'll do is I'll put this from
the<00:06:16.950> crown<00:06:17.160> of<00:06:17.280> my<00:06:17.370> head<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:18.210> that<00:06:18.420> waist

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
the crown of my head to that waist

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:30.550 
the crown of my head to that waist
length<00:06:18.990> line<00:06:19.230> to<00:06:19.440> show<00:06:20.360> where<00:06:27.050> that<00:06:28.050> would<00:06:28.320> be

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.890 

and<00:06:31.560> it<00:06:31.740> looks<00:06:31.950> like<00:06:32.750> from<00:06:33.750> what<00:06:33.990> I<00:06:34.020> can<00:06:34.170> see

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
and it looks like from what I can see

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.570 
and it looks like from what I can see
about<00:06:37.670> 23<00:06:38.670> inches<00:06:38.970> 22<00:06:39.390> 23<00:06:40.200> inches<00:06:40.620> is<00:06:40.860> probably

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
about 23 inches 22 23 inches is probably

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.030 
about 23 inches 22 23 inches is probably
waist<00:06:41.880> length<00:06:42.150> on<00:06:42.390> me<00:06:42.570> so<00:06:42.870> that<00:06:43.620> is<00:06:43.860> about

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
waist length on me so that is about

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.670 
waist length on me so that is about
