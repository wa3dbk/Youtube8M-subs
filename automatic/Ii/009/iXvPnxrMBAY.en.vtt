00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 now I want to tell you and this is a 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.110
 little emphasizing the previous part that 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.689
 when you have a very young client 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.660
 I ask you to be careful with the fashions 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.900
 the studies tell us that the bars of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.600
 fashion averages two years is a 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.310
 terrible statistics we have seen it in 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.470
 Mexico we have seen in different 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.169
 cities the trendy bar with great 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.890
 investment now they have to remodel 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.620
 paint changing the concept because it 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.690
 The clientele does not mean that 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.969
 those young people 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 do not go back to an establishment 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.219
 in fact, what we see around us 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.100
 from most universities to 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.780
 where I have the pleasure of attending 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.820
 we see that around them there 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.699
 different places of restaurants bars 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.729
 and that the young customers are going 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.250
 constantly to those places because 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.259
 they are close because they are near the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.200
 university because they offer low prices 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.320
 any subject that is but when 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.259
 talk about the trendy bar the bar where everything 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 world is arranged where people go to 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.440
 that they see it only averages those two 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.740
 years because that bar was positioned 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.659
 as fashion, not as the bar of all 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.159
 days not like the bar of all 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.210
 people and it's hard to get out of that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.360
 concept because I talk about this because what 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.789
 important is that you want in a bar 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.539
 regular customers and customers 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.270
 eventual wants clients that from time to time 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.300
 when there is a return in clients that 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.330
 go constants 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.120
 to your bar and once we have that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.120
 we will be able to grow much more 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.390
 whether you're on market how do you know if 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 is in these clients in the city I 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.410
 I recommend that you check four things 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.660
 On the one hand one has to see the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.750
 potential inhabitants and what kind of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.570
 inhabitants there are if we check in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.990
 the National Institute of statisti- 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.600
 our country we will find ourselves good and 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.220
 besides the maps that are so so today 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.890
 in good fashion we will find that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.620
 what kind of ages are there in our city 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.230
 where there is more population where there is less 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.440
 population maybe through the maps 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.290
 the famous google maps we find 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.570
 where there are more bars in the city we can 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.090
 make a map realize how many 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.270
 potential inhabitants that companies there are 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.120
 who are our clients and from there 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.490
 see obviously as I said in the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.790
 two positive days ago we will give 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.709
 account of what type of drinks they consume and 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 Whether it suits us or not if we like it or not 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.330
 this market if we have a lot 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.150
 competition this obviously we have 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.980
 what to do before renting our store 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.020
 because if we are not going to make a mistake 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.670
 very difficult especially in the industry 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.790
 of the bars where as I said in a 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.930
 principle we have to take a good 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.910
 decision to rent or rent a room 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.660
 we are going to start to realize if there 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.730
 direct or indirect competition 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.210
 direct competition are all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.130
 bars now does not mean that if there 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.740
 bars in our areas be 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.350
 necessarily bad in fact that's why there's 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.490
 Bar areas is a very custom 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.440
 common in spain that goes one of bars and 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.530
 then one does not visit one but three 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.130
 four five ten bars along the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.910
 night if that is the case in your city very 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.690
 surely a nearby bar is a good option 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.460
 so that later they arrive at the bar of you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.620
 then when there are bars it can be that 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.990
 tell us more or less than customers there 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 what kind of people visit that area if we 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.740
 it agrees or not after there is a second 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.380
 analysis that I recommend you do 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.920
 also in a list of the competition 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.209
 indirectly and they would be basically 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.950
 restaurants bars or any 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.980
 establishment that sells drinks 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.640
 alcoholic 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.950
 this to see that they sell more to give us 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.050
 Tells what they are doing 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.780
 competition there is a good side and there is a 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.330
 bad side the good side is if they sell 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.090
 something that I want to sell 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.560
 I will surely agree , however, 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.200
 bad side of the competition is that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.470
 could represent a total threat 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.450
 for my business in the future since 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.880
 we have investigated in depth of 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.530
 this client from statistics of 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.440
 walk the place all we have 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.190
 mentioned now if we can make a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.640
 type of clients that we see that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.290
 we project that we 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.500
 prospective masters what I'm going to ask is 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.770
 make your customer avatar that is a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.350
 client's avatar and before continuing to 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.690
 the slide the customer avatar of 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.900
 done sees the crowd return the avatar of 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.110
 client is a detailed description of 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.600
 the people that you could see in your 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.490
 bar but preferably customers 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.890
 what are you going to have, let's suppose 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.060
 that you go to the bar area is given 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.680
 note that there is a local 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.259
 and what could I rent 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.940
 he realizes that this is an area where 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.590
 there are more women first feature 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.500
 of the avatar 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.750
 woman second feature you give yourself 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.120
 account that there is an average age of about 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.820
 45 40 years ago he puts it there in his avatar 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.810
 third all eat fourth all go very 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.550
 elegant 5 and so you are writing down the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.419
 characteristics and the avatar is going to be the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.250
 client to whom you are going to design 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.720
 perfectly that bar which is going to 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:09.470
 design all the drinks and everything 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.630
 will be done at that time 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.840
 you also have to be careful how 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.650
 we mentioned the imminent dangers 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.750
 throughout the area where we are going to 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.090
 establish we want to be in zones 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.130
 sure we want you to be 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.080
 totally safe and taking the 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.890
 proper precautions very surely 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.990
 you will be but we mentioned it 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.210
 again now to this point to the 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.960
 customers we have to think about 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.200
 places and in situations once for 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.840
 all before opening how to do it for 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.440
 attract more customers and come back and 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.440
 come back
