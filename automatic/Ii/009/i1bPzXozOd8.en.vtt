necessary now to me this is a little
funny<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:27.470> don't<00:02:28.470> feel<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.770> needs<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.100> be

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
funny but I don't feel this needs to be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.360 
funny but I don't feel this needs to be
drained<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.410> was<00:02:31.530> making<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:32.040> earlier
