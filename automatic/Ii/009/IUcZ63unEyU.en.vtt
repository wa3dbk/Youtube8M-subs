00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690 

the<00:00:00.930> next<00:00:01.230> segment<00:00:01.650> on<00:00:01.800> wheel<00:00:02.100> alignment<00:00:02.639> I

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
the next segment on wheel alignment I

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.510 
the next segment on wheel alignment I
want<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> talk<00:00:03.090> about<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.560> steering<00:00:04.890> axis

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
want to talk about is the steering axis

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.670 
want to talk about is the steering axis
now<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.240> steering<00:00:06.899> axis<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> pretty

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
now the steering axis is pretty

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.280 
now the steering axis is pretty
important<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.480> dotted<00:00:09.960> red

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
important so you have this dotted red

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.070 
important so you have this dotted red
line<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.389> going<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.750> what

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
line here and this is going to be what

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.519 
line here and this is going to be what
you'll<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.380> rotating<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.490> wheel<00:00:14.519> about<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:16.170> as

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you'll be rotating the wheel about so as

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.680 
you'll be rotating the wheel about so as
you<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.279> there's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.029> distance<00:00:18.539> between

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
you can see there's a distance between

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.500 
you can see there's a distance between
the<00:00:19.080> center<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> tire<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:21.060> center

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the center of the tire and the center

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.800 
the center of the tire and the center
where<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.140> steering<00:00:22.529> axis<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
where the steering axis is so that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.300 
where the steering axis is so that
distance<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.380> called<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> scrub<00:00:25.949> radius

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
distance is called the scrub radius

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
distance is called the scrub radius
because<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.090> turn<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> tire<00:00:27.900> around

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
because as you turn that tire around

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
because as you turn that tire around
you're<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.340> scrub<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> along

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you're going to have to scrub it along

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
you're going to have to scrub it along
the<00:00:30.240> ground<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> move<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.859> not

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the ground to get it to move it's not

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.380 
the ground to get it to move it's not
going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.340> rotating<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:33.059> its<00:00:33.120> center

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to be rotating about its center

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
going to be rotating about its center
which<00:00:34.050> would<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.350> ideal<00:00:34.500> because<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
which would be ideal because then you

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.959 
which would be ideal because then you
wouldn't<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:35.910> scrubbing<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:38.640> fix

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
wouldn't have any scrubbing now you fix

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
wouldn't have any scrubbing now you fix
this<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.450> two<00:00:39.690> things<00:00:40.020> first<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.980> going

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this with two things first you're going

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
this with two things first you're going
to<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.219> steering<00:00:41.820> axis<00:00:42.270> inclination<00:00:42.750> so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to have steering axis inclination so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
to have steering axis inclination so
that<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> top<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.250> steering<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that the top of the steering is a little

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
that the top of the steering is a little
bit<00:00:45.360> further<00:00:45.960> back<00:00:46.230> than<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.829> bottom<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bit further back than the bottom and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
bit further back than the bottom and
then<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.170> incline

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
then you're going to have this incline

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.510 
then you're going to have this incline
steering<00:00:50.460> axis<00:00:50.989> now<00:00:51.989> also<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.250> along<00:00:53.489> with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
steering axis now also to go along with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
steering axis now also to go along with
that<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.300> talking<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that which I was talking about in the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.080 
that which I was talking about in the
previous<00:00:55.230> video<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.399> slight<00:00:56.789> positive

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
previous video is a slight positive

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
previous video is a slight positive
camber<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> slight<00:00:58.800> positive<00:00:59.250> camber<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
camber so the slight positive camber and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510 
camber so the slight positive camber and
then<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.629> get<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.379> accesses<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
then you can get these two accesses to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.450 
then you can get these two accesses to
come<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> similar<00:01:04.199> point<00:01:04.229> not<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.979> exact

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
come to a similar point not the exact

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
come to a similar point not the exact
same<00:01:05.640> point<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
same point but you're going to have a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
same point but you're going to have a
much<00:01:06.960> smaller<00:01:07.200> scrub<00:01:07.770> radius<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> tire

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
much smaller scrub radius so that tire

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500 
much smaller scrub radius so that tire
can<00:01:09.450> rotate<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:10.049> easily<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:11.310> since<00:01:12.060> that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
can rotate more easily now since that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
can rotate more easily now since that
tire<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> rotate<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.500> easily<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
tire is going to rotate more easily it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679 
tire is going to rotate more easily it's
going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> reduce<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.030> effort<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> driver

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
going to reduce the effort the driver

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.149 
going to reduce the effort the driver
has<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:16.619> you're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.040> low

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
has to have when you're going at low

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
has to have when you're going at low
speeds<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> turning<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.350> going

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
speeds and turning and it's also going

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
speeds and turning and it's also going
to<00:01:19.799> minimize<00:01:20.159> tire<00:01:20.490> wear<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.939> you're<00:01:21.090> not

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to minimize tire wear because you're not

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
to minimize tire wear because you're not
going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.450> scrubbing<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> along<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.470> large

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
going to be scrubbing it along a large

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.820 
going to be scrubbing it along a large
radius<00:01:23.479> now<00:01:24.479> there's<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.110> other<00:01:25.140> benefit<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
radius now there's one other benefit to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.120 
radius now there's one other benefit to
having<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.850> inclined<00:01:27.299> steering<00:01:27.900> axis<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.100> as

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
having an inclined steering axis so as

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.640 
having an inclined steering axis so as
you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.750> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.170> an<00:01:31.290> incline

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
you can see if you have an incline

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.999 
you can see if you have an incline
steering<00:01:32.070> axis<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> you've<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.049> shaft

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
steering axis and you've got the shaft

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.450 
steering axis and you've got the shaft
going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.909> tire<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.110> turn<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.680> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
going to the tire as you turn that it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
going to the tire as you turn that it's
going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> force<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> tire<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.200> let<00:01:40.680> me

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
going to force the tire down up let me

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to force the tire down up let me
give<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> small<00:01:41.159> demonstration<00:01:41.430> here

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
give a small demonstration here

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
give a small demonstration here
so<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.490> an

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so if you have this and it's at an

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.359 
so if you have this and it's at an
incline<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> your

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
incline and then this is going to your

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.240 
incline and then this is going to your
tire<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.329> rotate<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.009> see

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
tire and you rotate this you can see

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.550 
tire and you rotate this you can see
that<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.579> red<00:01:50.759> marker<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.509> down<00:01:51.899> that's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that the red marker is going down that's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
that the red marker is going down that's
going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.189> tire<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:53.939> tires<00:01:54.240> here

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
going to be your tire if your tires here

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
going to be your tire if your tires here
and<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.200> rotate<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.770> steering<00:01:56.070> axis<00:01:56.549> it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and you rotate that steering axis it's

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.850 
and you rotate that steering axis it's
going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> force<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.840> tire<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.320> downward

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
going to force the tire to go downward

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
going to force the tire to go downward
now<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> force<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> tire<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> go

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
now when you force the tire to go

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.179 
now when you force the tire to go
downward<00:02:01.229> obviously<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> ground<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.040> not

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
downward obviously the ground is not

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:02.810 
downward obviously the ground is not
going<00:02:02.460> anywhere

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
going anywhere

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.209 
going anywhere
so<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.420> car<00:02:03.600> might<00:02:03.810> actually<00:02:04.229> lift<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.009> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
so your car might actually lift up a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.740 
so your car might actually lift up a
little<00:02:05.399> bit<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.969> notice<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.600> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
little bit you can notice that if you're

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.119 
little bit you can notice that if you're
just<00:02:06.960> sitting<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> parking<00:02:07.770> lot<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
just sitting in a parking lot and you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.279 
just sitting in a parking lot and you
turn<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.550> tire<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> way<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.869> end<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
turn your tire all the way to the end of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.400 
turn your tire all the way to the end of
the<00:02:10.379> lock<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:11.599> what<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.810> does

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the lock now what this does

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.650 
the lock now what this does
is<00:02:13.470> because<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.060> resistance

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
is because you have this resistance

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780 
is because you have this resistance
force<00:02:16.020> when<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.380> turn<00:02:16.680> when<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> let<00:02:17.610> go<00:02:17.760> of

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
force when you turn when you let go of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.550 
force when you turn when you let go of
the<00:02:17.970> steering<00:02:18.240> wheel<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.020> car<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the steering wheel the car is going to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.750 
the steering wheel the car is going to
want<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.770> go<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.250> where<00:02:20.370> there's<00:02:20.550> less

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
want to go back to where there's less

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
want to go back to where there's less
resistance<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.530> go

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
resistance so it's just going to go

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.680 
resistance so it's just going to go
right<00:02:22.860> back<00:02:23.070> straight<00:02:23.520> ahead<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
right back straight ahead because of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.540 
right back straight ahead because of
that<00:02:24.840> steering<00:02:25.170> axis<00:02:25.620> inclination<00:02:26.070> which<00:02:26.400> is

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
that steering axis inclination which is

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
that steering axis inclination which is
great<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> keeps<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.660> straight

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
great because it keeps you on straight

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.820 
great because it keeps you on straight
when<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.860> don't<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> turn<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.820> that

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
when you don't want to turn and that

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.820 
when you don't want to turn and that
steering<00:02:31.830> axis<00:02:32.280> inclination
