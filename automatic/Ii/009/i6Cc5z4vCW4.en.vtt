want to look if you can see the grain

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
want to look if you can see the grain
lines<00:00:33.149> running<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:36.149> most<00:00:36.360> important<00:00:36.960> thing

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
lines running the most important thing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400 
lines running the most important thing
is<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> grain<00:00:38.969> runs<00:00:39.390> straight<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.200> one

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
is that the grain runs straight from one

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229 
is that the grain runs straight from one
side<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> other<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:42.030> any

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.860 
side to the other you don't want any
knots<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.320> don't<00:00:43.469> want<00:00:43.680> any<00:00:43.890> wavy<00:00:44.250> grain<00:00:44.870> you

knots you don't want any wavy grain you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
knots you don't want any wavy grain you
don't<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.440> run<00:00:46.710> offs<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.879> those

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
don't want any run offs because those

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.490 
don't want any run offs because those
are<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.360> places<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> arrow<00:00:49.200> could

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
are all places where the arrow could

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.700 
are all places where the arrow could
break<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> arrow<00:00:52.379> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
break when you use it so this arrow is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
break when you use it so this arrow is
going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.300> bows<00:00:54.710> probably<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

to 40 pounds of of draw weight so once

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
to 40 pounds of of draw weight so once
it<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.760> dull<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.689> doesn't<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it by your dull and it doesn't have to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
it by your dull and it doesn't have to
be<00:01:07.560> perfectly<00:01:07.950> straight<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.820> see

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
be perfectly straight as you can see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
be perfectly straight as you can see
it's<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.080> perfectly<00:01:10.530> straight<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it's not perfectly straight it's a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's not perfectly straight it's a
little<00:01:11.400> crooked<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.600> fix<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.250> but

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
little crooked and we can fix that but

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
little crooked and we can fix that but
it's<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.610> important<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.240> perfect

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's more important to have perfect

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.660 
it's more important to have perfect
grain<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> perfectly<00:01:17.040> straight<00:01:18.500> so

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
grain that to be perfectly straight so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.060 
grain that to be perfectly straight so
you<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.090> double<00:01:21.710> for<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> fledging

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

into<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.500> could<00:02:14.680> use<00:02:14.860> whatever<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.400> want

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
into it you could use whatever you want

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
into it you could use whatever you want
beeswax<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.750> good<00:02:16.959> because<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.560> know<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.800> can

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
beeswax is good because you know you can

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.360 
beeswax is good because you know you can
apply<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.540> multiple<00:02:19.540> times<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.860> resists

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
apply it multiple times in it it resists

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.740 
apply it multiple times in it it resists
water<00:02:21.459> pretty<00:02:21.910> well<00:02:22.440> okay<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.420> look<00:02:25.600> at

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
water pretty well okay so if you look at

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.490 
water pretty well okay so if you look at
our<00:02:25.780> arrow<00:02:26.470> shop<00:02:27.450> you'd<00:02:28.450> see<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.610> not

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
our arrow shop you'd see it's not

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190 
our arrow shop you'd see it's not
incredibly<00:02:32.500> straight<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.459> if<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.630> bend<00:02:34.870> isn't

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
incredibly straight so if the bend isn't

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.250 
incredibly straight so if the bend isn't
that<00:02:35.320> severe<00:02:35.739> what<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.260> you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
that severe what you can do is you you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.100 
that severe what you can do is you you
find<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.680> bent<00:02:39.300> which<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.510> right<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.989> this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
find the bent which is right on this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.949 
find the bent which is right on this
side<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:42.280> take<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.880> shaft<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.660> your<00:02:43.780> hand

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
side you take the shaft in your hand

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.110 
side you take the shaft in your hand
like<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:45.340> actually<00:02:45.760> apply

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
like this and you actually apply

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.530 
like this and you actually apply
pressure<00:02:47.489> against<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.550> curve<00:02:51.239> then<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.360> go

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
pressure against the curve then you go

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.360 
pressure against the curve then you go
back<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.840> check<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:55.019> do<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.170> again<00:02:56.370> you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
back and check just do that again you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.850 
back and check just do that again you
want<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.580> be<00:02:57.730> gentle<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.470> other<00:02:59.590> hand

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
want to be gentle but on the other hand

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.040 
want to be gentle but on the other hand
you<00:02:59.980> want<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.190> make<00:03:00.280> sure<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.480> arrow<00:03:01.720> can

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
you want to make sure that the arrow can

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.890 
you want to make sure that the arrow can
take<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:02.440> kind<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.769> flexing<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.239> arrow

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
take this kind of flexing if the arrow

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.390 
take this kind of flexing if the arrow
can't<00:03:05.410> flex<00:03:05.769> like<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.650> wouldn't<00:03:09.160> use

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
can't flex like this then I wouldn't use

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.890 
can't flex like this then I wouldn't use
it<00:03:09.430> because<00:03:09.820> it's<00:03:10.209> probably<00:03:10.390> going<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.690> break

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
it because it's probably going to break

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.539 
it because it's probably going to break
up<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:16.000> note<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.209> these<00:03:16.600> dowel<00:03:16.870> chefs

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
up and just note that these dowel chefs

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.949 
up and just note that these dowel chefs
usually<00:03:18.549> don't<00:03:18.790> stay<00:03:19.090> super<00:03:19.480> straight

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
usually don't stay super straight

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.310 
usually don't stay super straight
forever<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.769> you're<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.310> have<00:03:21.459> to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
forever so you're going to have to

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.569 
forever so you're going to have to
periodically<00:03:23.320> straighten<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.070> every<00:03:24.400> time

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
periodically straighten it every time

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.900 
periodically straighten it every time
you<00:03:24.760> shoot<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.590> see<00:03:26.769> now<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
you shoot it if you can see now the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.289 
you shoot it if you can see now the
shaft<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.390> straight<00:03:29.070> now<00:03:30.070> if<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.700> if<00:03:31.090> it's

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
shaft is straight now if the if it's

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.930 
shaft is straight now if the if it's
really<00:03:31.630> warped<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.200> could<00:03:32.380> actually<00:03:32.940> steam

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
really warped you could actually steam

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.690 
really warped you could actually steam
it<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.350> could<00:03:35.620> hold<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.890> over<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.160> pot<00:03:36.459> of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it so you could hold it over a pot of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.810 
it so you could hold it over a pot of
boiling<00:03:36.940> water<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.739> then<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:39.340> would<00:03:39.519> become

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
boiling water and then it would become

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.440 
boiling water and then it would become
pliable<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.840> shape<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:42.329> but<00:03:43.329> really

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
pliable so you can shape it but really

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.020 
pliable so you can shape it but really
with<00:03:43.750> dowels<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.440> want<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.650> pick<00:03:44.829> it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
with dowels you just want to pick it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.340 
with dowels you just want to pick it
where<00:03:46.030> it's<00:03:46.209> fairly<00:03:46.450> straight<00:03:46.930> where<00:03:47.170> that's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
where it's fairly straight where that's

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.530 
where it's fairly straight where that's
all<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.680> need<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.910> what<00:03:49.030> we're<00:03:49.180> going<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.359> do

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
all you need now what we're going to do

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.050 
all you need now what we're going to do
is<00:03:50.320> I'm<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:50.980> going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.930> sand<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.109> shaft<00:03:54.060> then

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
is I'm just going to sand the shaft then

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.770 
is I'm just going to sand the shaft then
all<00:03:55.239> of<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.630> rough<00:03:56.560> burrs<00:03:56.890> off<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.400> it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.300 

so<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.990> arrow<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.440> really<00:04:03.740> simple

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
so this arrow is really simple

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.880 
so this arrow is really simple
nothing<00:04:04.850> fancy<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:09.320> something<00:04:09.800> you

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
nothing fancy to it but something you

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.370 
nothing fancy to it but something you
could<00:04:10.070> do<00:04:10.360> with<00:04:11.360> just<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.660> little<00:04:11.900> bit<00:04:12.050> of<00:04:12.170> time

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
could do with just a little bit of time

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.440 
could do with just a little bit of time
and<00:04:12.830> won't<00:04:12.980> cost<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.490> that<00:04:13.670> much<00:04:15.070> alright<00:04:16.450> so

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
and won't cost you that much alright so

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.320 
and won't cost you that much alright so
now<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.600> we're<00:04:17.930> finished<00:04:18.890> sanding<00:04:19.280> what<00:04:20.209> you

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
now that we're finished sanding what you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.230 
now that we're finished sanding what you
want<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.600> do<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.930> want<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.170> look<00:04:22.030> at<00:04:23.030> your

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
want to do is you want to look at your

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.230 
want to do is you want to look at your
arrow<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:24.160> want<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.250> look<00:04:25.340> at<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> grain<00:04:25.910> on

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
arrow I want to look at the grain on

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.990 
arrow I want to look at the grain on
either<00:04:26.660> side<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.550> want<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.640> find<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
either side you want to find the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.210 
either side you want to find the
straightest<00:04:29.570> grain<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.320> straightest<00:04:31.010> grain

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
straightest grain so straightest grain

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.490 
straightest grain so straightest grain
is<00:04:31.400> over<00:04:31.640> here<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.720> this<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:33.020> going<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.380> our

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
is over here so this is going to be our

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.080 
is over here so this is going to be our
point<00:04:33.710> side<00:04:34.010> because<00:04:34.370> it's<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.850> be

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
point side because it's going to be

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.570 
point side because it's going to be
under<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.810> lot<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.050> pressure<00:04:36.140> every<00:04:36.740> time<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
under a lot of pressure every time the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.520 
under a lot of pressure every time the
arrow<00:04:37.730> hits<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.150> target<00:04:38.390> this<00:04:38.930> is<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.140> point

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
arrow hits the target this is the point

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.830 
arrow hits the target this is the point
this<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.460> side<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.030> needs<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.480> hold<00:04:41.690> up

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
this is the side that needs to hold up

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.360 
this is the side that needs to hold up
to<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.200> abuse<00:04:42.760> this<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:45.680> still<00:04:45.950> good

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
to the abuse this is it's still good

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.340 
to the abuse this is it's still good
straight<00:04:46.790> grain<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:47.270> there's<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.510> little<00:04:47.720> bit

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
straight grain but there's a little bit

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.220 
straight grain but there's a little bit
of<00:04:48.380> curve<00:04:49.340> in<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.640> drain<00:04:49.880> here<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.080> is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
of curve in the drain here so this is

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.160 
of curve in the drain here so this is
where<00:04:51.380> we're<00:04:51.500> going<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.650> put<00:04:51.800> our<00:04:51.920> nock<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.630> if

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
you can see if you can see the grain is

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.200 
you can see if you can see the grain is

running this way on this arrow so what

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.760 
running this way on this arrow so what
we're<00:05:05.360> going<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.630> do<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:06.020> we're<00:05:06.170> going<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.470> cut

against the grain so you just take your
tile<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:15.100> take<00:05:16.100> your<00:05:16.250> arrow
