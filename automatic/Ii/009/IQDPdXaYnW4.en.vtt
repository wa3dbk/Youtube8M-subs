00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
but I wish the background was white

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
but I wish the background was white
instead<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.780> yellow<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.040> why<00:01:41.189> they

logical<00:01:43.680> reason<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> feel<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> will

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
logical reason but I feel like it will

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.319 
logical reason but I feel like it will
just<00:01:45.030> look<00:01:45.149> better<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> blend<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:48.210> in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
just look better to blend in here the in

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.370 
just look better to blend in here the in
the<00:01:48.420> toy<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.320> quite

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the toy it actually doesn't look quite

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
the toy it actually doesn't look quite
as<00:01:49.500> bad<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:49.770> definitely<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> show<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
as bad but definitely in the show the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
as bad but definitely in the show the

clunky<00:01:55.820> like<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.909> said<00:01:57.119> there's<00:01:57.329> part<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
clunky like I said there's part of me I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
clunky like I said there's part of me I
think<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.229> looks<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.500> cool<00:01:59.040> there's<00:01:59.280> some

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
think it looks really cool there's some

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340 
think it looks really cool there's some
really<00:01:59.640> cool<00:01:59.969> sleek<00:02:00.390> ideas<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
really cool sleek ideas going on here I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
really cool sleek ideas going on here I
love<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> head<00:02:01.860> sculpt<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
love the head sculpt I think that this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
love the head sculpt I think that this
kind<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> looks<00:02:03.780> good<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> same<00:02:04.530> time

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
kind of looks good but at the same time

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.459 
kind of looks good but at the same time
if<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.280> clunky<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> wish<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> yellow

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
if so clunky and I wish that the yellow

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.430 
if so clunky and I wish that the yellow
was<00:02:07.740> white<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.539> down<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> got<00:02:10.289> his

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
was white and then down here you got his

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.500 
was white and then down here you got his
floaty<00:02:10.800> arms<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.489> again<00:02:12.120> there's<00:02:12.360> some

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
floaty arms which again there's some

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
floaty arms which again there's some
cool<00:02:12.720> ideas<00:02:12.930> about

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
cool ideas about

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.820 
cool ideas about
it<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.879> he<00:02:15.420> has<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.900> these<00:02:16.050> special

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830

in a different exclusive set which i

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.540 
in a different exclusive set which i
think<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.769> dumb<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> think<00:02:23.129> would<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.489> been

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
think is dumb I think would have been

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.650 
think is dumb I think would have been
neat<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> slightly<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.540> expensive

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
neat to do a slightly more expensive

type formula set that just came with

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.670 
type formula set that just came with
this<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.239> then<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.390> ones<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.870> had<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.470> I

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this and then the ones that had it but I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.050 
this and then the ones that had it but I
don't<00:02:29.069> know<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:29.459> they're<00:02:29.580> thinking<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
don't know what they're thinking is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.059 
don't know what they're thinking is
anymore<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.540> terms<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.930> tires<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.830> Center

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
anymore in terms of tires so you Center

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.020 
anymore in terms of tires so you Center
just<00:02:32.220> give<00:02:32.310> these<00:02:32.400> two<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.790> generic

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
just give these two little generic

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
just give these two little generic
floaty<00:02:33.299> ones<00:02:33.569> get<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> driver<00:02:34.410> they're

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
floaty ones get the driver they're

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.660 
floaty ones get the driver they're
pretty<00:02:34.830> generic<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.519> there's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
pretty generic you can see there's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.770 
pretty generic you can see there's
actually<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:35.970> symbol<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> though<00:02:36.629> for

actually little symbol on it though for

actually little symbol on it though for
type<00:02:36.930> formula<00:02:37.349> which<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.500> neat<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
type formula which is neat and then the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
bottom of legs are you know just kind of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.559 
bottom of legs are you know just kind of
generic<00:02:41.190> whenever<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.849> do<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.330> feel<00:02:42.480> like

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
generic whenever I do this I feel like

all is the same base mold the only real
difference<00:03:28.410> being<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.069> he's<00:03:29.160> got<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> lot

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
more bulk to him so he is a bit more

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.120 
said my opinions on the forum itself are
mixed<00:03:54.720> there's<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.019> almost<00:03:55.410> equal<00:03:55.799> parts

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
mixed there's like almost equal parts

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.830 
mixed there's like almost equal parts
positive<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.760> negative<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.150> terms<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.510> design

positive and negative in terms of design

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.530 
positive and negative in terms of design
but<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.280> terms<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.849> figure<00:04:00.269> I

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
but just in terms of the figure I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.909 
but just in terms of the figure I
definitely<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
definitely think it's one of the

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.520 
definitely think it's one of the
stronger<00:04:02.280> looking<00:04:02.849> ones<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.419> sure<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.900> really

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
stronger looking ones for sure I really

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.659 
stronger looking ones for sure I really
like<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.889> way<00:04:04.980> they<00:04:05.130> have<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> compound

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
like the way they have the compound

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.699 
like the way they have the compound
effect<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> eyes<00:04:06.359> there<00:04:06.750> are<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.410> almost

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
effect on the eyes there are the almost

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.710 
effect on the eyes there are the almost
compound<00:04:08.099> effect<00:04:08.370> on<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.609> eyes<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.660> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
compound effect on the eyes I think the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
compound effect on the eyes I think the
paint<00:04:09.959> looks<00:04:10.139> good<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.799> just<00:04:10.980> overall<00:04:11.340> I

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
paint looks good it's just overall I

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.550 
paint looks good it's just overall I
think<00:04:11.639> a<00:04:11.880> good<00:04:12.120> representation<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.230> form

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
think a good representation of the form

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.650 
think a good representation of the form
I<00:04:13.739> think<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:14.040> looks<00:04:14.220> good<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.609> Shelf<00:04:14.880> I'm

he's done Matt but regardless I think

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.159 
he's done Matt but regardless I think
that's<00:04:39.880> kind<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.150> fun<00:04:40.389> for<00:04:40.570> people<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:40.990> just

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169

I<00:04:43.600> can't<00:04:44.020> recommend<00:04:44.320> this<00:04:44.530> figure<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.830> think

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100

it's one of the better TK figures
