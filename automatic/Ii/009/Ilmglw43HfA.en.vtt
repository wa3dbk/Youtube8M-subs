00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but this one seems to stand out a little

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459 
but this one seems to stand out a little
bit<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.480> I've<00:00:48.989> always<00:00:49.170> kind<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
bit more to me like I've always kind of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
bit more to me like I've always kind of
liked<00:00:49.649> those<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.340> marksmen<00:00:50.820> type

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
liked those like more marksmen type

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
liked those like more marksmen type
weapons<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.809> they've<00:00:51.960> never<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.530> been

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
weapons but they've never really been

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
weapons but they've never really been
like<00:00:53.430> super<00:00:53.820> insanely<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.469> at

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like super insanely good this one at

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
like super insanely good this one at
least<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.160> played<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.730> far<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
least from what I played so far at the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
capture event and at the event at e3 and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
capture event and at the event at e3 and
stuff<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.379> seems<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> stand

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
stuff like that this one seems to stand

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.959 
stuff like that this one seems to stand
out<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
out a little bit more just like it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
out a little bit more just like it
medium<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.719> long<00:01:03.899> range<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.379> absolutely<00:01:05.420> melts

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
medium to long range it absolutely melts

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000 
medium to long range it absolutely melts
people<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> absolutely<00:01:07.200> cuts<00:01:07.439> through<00:01:07.619> even

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
people it absolutely cuts through even

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
people it absolutely cuts through even
like<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> xr2<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.540> good

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
like the xr2 which is the really good

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.210 
like the xr2 which is the really good
three<00:01:09.900> round<00:01:10.110> burst<00:01:10.320> weapon<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> put

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
three round burst weapon if you put

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.800 
three round burst weapon if you put
somebody<00:01:11.490> against<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
somebody against that and they have this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
somebody against that and they have this
weapon<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.070> cuts<00:01:14.460> through<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> but

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
weapon it still just cuts through it but

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
weapon it still just cuts through it but
it's<00:01:15.180> insane<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.720> accurate<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.439> just

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it's insane how accurate it is and just

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's insane how accurate it is and just
like<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.130> obviously<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
like you know obviously because it's so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.609 
like you know obviously because it's so
powerful<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.049> hitting<00:01:19.200> people<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
powerful when you're hitting people it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
powerful when you're hitting people it
makes<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.950> flinch<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> stuff<00:01:20.880> like

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
makes them flinch at on and stuff like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
makes them flinch at on and stuff like
that<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.439> good

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that so it's just it's a very very good

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
that so it's just it's a very very good
weapon<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.189> until<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> point<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> only
