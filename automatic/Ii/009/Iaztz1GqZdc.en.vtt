00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all these insects a girl 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259
 I hope you are well 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 in any case, I'm fine, we're 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.290
 find today for my first 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 tutorial so this first tutorial which 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 I will explain how a cube 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.580
 and sticky eggs so that can 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 look simple but for beginners 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.859
 so those who start in breeding 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.689
 phase is not always easy 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 so to incubate the eggs there is 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.750
 many ways so you can either 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.800
 master of sopalin or vermiculite 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 but I advise you to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.809
 vermiculite because it's because it's moldy 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.289
 not unlike the sopalin so for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 incubate the eyes you have to bring yourself 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.809
 one minute 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.149
 so you have to bring a box 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.870
 a super war or a gryon box 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 empty so you're worthy in pet shop so 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.730
 I was directly pet I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.489
 asked them if he had any votes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.710
 should be empty and he asks for forgiveness and the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.439
 moment to give a voice there you can 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.890
 go to a pet friend directly 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.720
 and if the seller is kind enough he 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 will give you so that's so next 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 you pick up your canyon box or your 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 tupperware makes you holes so I 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 do not know if you see them so there you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.500
 have to see them you take yourself by 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.720
 example a compass and you break through 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.950
 small holes so all over the surface 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.619
 from above so of course does not do it 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.159
 on the sides or if you make 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.570
 in well above because if you never 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.610
 be careful and that you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.979
 be made of euros you never know 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.009
 the sticks to escape especially the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.380
 babies so that's it so you do them 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 well above not too big so that's it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.549
 for vermiculite so here I am going to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.680
 talk a little about vermiculite so 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.759
 you see there I already have about 20 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.790
 I do not know but you can see that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.490
 I have a little bit and I have 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 already paid 4 euros so it's still 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.630
 relatively expensive so me I you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.620
 advise is to go to leroy merlin 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.810
 or apricot man or brico deposit and you 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.069
 buy directly 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.220
 I do not know anymore and how many liters 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.350
 must be 15 liters or I do not know anymore 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.030
 where 5 liters I do not know very well anymore and 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.580
 it's 15 euros so there you will 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.170
 directly a big know that you 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.660
 will pay 15 euros but you can 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.950
 use for longer 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.870
 so now so I'm you 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.480
 talking I'll explain forgiveness 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.560
 how a cube and the eggs so 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.450
 how to put the particle it and so on 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.750
 So here we are two minutes away 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.860
 so you take vermiculite so 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.600
 So here you put about 2 cm on 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.190
 see there you see you put about 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.180
 two centimeters of vermiculite so 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.049
 So here you go, take your eyes 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.570
 so I can not open the box 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.420
 because otherwise the air finally moisture 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.640
 will take off but to prove to one 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.890
 beautiful to remove you cover of course and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.440
 you put your e directly on the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.840
 vermiculite so here is so you can 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.040
 disperse them or do you want this 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.320
 does not matter if help goes 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.820
 for example bury the tooth the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.239
 vermiculite it does not matter any 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.780
 way they will come out so that's so 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.900
 there as soon as you did that you take 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.459
 your sprayer here and you 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.690
 humidified 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.820
 so me what I advise you so 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.470
 that after all points of the species of 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.600
 species are spaces that asks 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.810
 to be moistened every day but by 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.000
 example me and me rudin ssp jose 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.250
 moisten once a week so badly 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.540
 advice that I could give you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.260
 it is that you have put your eyes 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.500
 you moistened and you said you're proud 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.690
 when you feel that it is no longer 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.410
 Inside wet so that's me so 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.930
 I advise you so I do it 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.209
 once a week but after that you 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.090
 duty 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.880
 as soon as you see that the box is 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.060
 wetter could change a little 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.789
 so to moisten you do not do 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.009
 not so much to drown them a you 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.880
 put a lot of sprayers 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.560
 misty mode and makes you two three 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.569
 so kick a shot there a hallway 1 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.520
 color ya blow there so that's after 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.090
 you close well box is very 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.669
 important 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.410
 so because if you leave the box 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.400
 opened the moisture will get off very 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.319
 quickly 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.770
 so that's so I think I did 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.300
 a little around all that must if 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.639
 you never have questions 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.870
 not to ask me in the comments 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.789
 so I like is also my skype in 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.080
 the comments so like that if you 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.620
 have questions or if you wish 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.810
 discuss 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.360
 so that will be better so here we go 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.860
 it was a girl sector for my first 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.690
 tutorial based on how a cube and the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.550
 eggs of stick insects so here we are 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.970
 find again very soon for a next 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.639
 video including a project where I'm going 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:31.610
 explain to you how well started in 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:34.039
 terrariophilie so here is soon so 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.710
 here I am again I forgot about you 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.560
 to say something is that as soon as 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.050
 you as soon as you from his nose and so your 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.710
 phasms you that there are phases puts 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.060
 in the box 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.440
 leave well your sticks three four 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.530
 days in the box 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.990
 so for good that for although the 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.380
 phasme goes away from the shell my end 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.560
 of his egg forgive that because if 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.590
 you take off you'll see that he 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.909
 is still the egg that hooked on his 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.940
 paws so that can really be 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.590
 dangerous if you remove it like that 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.659
 So here it was just that I had 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.659
 forgot to tell you soon
