00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.849
 Hello girls how are you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.580
 today I'm here again to teach the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 make a cooking prescription that's it 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.600
 Let's go to the kitchen today. I found one. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.490
 internet revenue 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.859
 I found it very interesting for who 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.680
 do not know was for eight years vegan and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.480
 18 years two years I tried to be vegan 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.130
 I caught that person who does not eat any 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 product of animal origin 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 Only I thought it was very difficult, you pick up 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 because nowhere do I exist 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 products not of animal origin 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 It's been four years since I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 eat meat and make four years old was born 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 try to avoid 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.530
 and this degree he will neither the people nor 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 milk I found it very cool Thursday in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 a vegetarian or vegan diet 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.460
 simply for those who want to avoid 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.820
 products is very cool. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.260
 I'll even teach them how to do it and the admission 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.400
 in the video today wanting to appear 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.180
 crazy 18 the year girls come on 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.130
 learn girls then I got one 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.409
 Cup I got a cup a little bit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.509
 too great for the recipe I suggest 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.880
 In your house , take that cup of 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 coffee tastes a little smaller than it gives 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 also the first ingredient I 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.479
 I used wheat flour and flour 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 white, but you can do it with 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.250
 whole is very tasty too and I 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.020
 I put two and a half spoons of cold 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.869
 but you can only put two spoons 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.180
 soup that gets stuck until 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.180
 better than the people than my own. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.890
 then I put the chocolate as 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.899
 here at home I only had chocolate 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.390
 I put it myself but the ideal is that 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.549
 you make with cocoa powder because there 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 you are at risk of having a trace of 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.299
 cocoa powder chocolate I did 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.500
 two and a half spoons because I wanted to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.500
 with a good taste of chocolate 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.620
 the brownie traditionally has nuts or 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.170
 some type of nut is to replace it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.209
 by oats for me because I wanted to have 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 that inventing wanted to change I had to see in 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.230
 home and replace put was well 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
 tasty 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.569
 put two spoons after I put 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.569
 a tip of the margarine spoon 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 light 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.730
 I also put sugar crystal place 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.130
 two tablespoons a spoon and a half 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.190
 Truth you can do without sugar as 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.739
 can for as sweetener was sugar can 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.810
 brown 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:56.380
 I really wanted candy, even I put it on. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.790
 There are six tablespoons of water here. 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.799
 water but you will put it up to you 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.530
 see that giving the point 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.019
 the point is an element it is not much 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.430
 soft it's a point a little bit longer 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.500
 hard so I moved like a fork there one 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.640
 Tip better mess with the fork that goes 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.390
 spoon because it mixes faster and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.900
 best 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.130
 I left a minute in the microwave and was 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.209
 ready 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.040
 after all, he stayed like that with 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.530
 consistency of the brownie got much 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.989
 I really loved it and the suggestion is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.769
 served with ice cream soy girls 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.290
 It looks very good so this is it girls 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.360
 I hope that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.640
 did you like this recipe? 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.340
 It's really cool, it 's very fast. 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.170
 ready in a minute and besides being 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.180
 Hot is very hot. 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.849
 She's a different Brazil in that brown. 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 and full of calories that we family 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.640
 would do but it is a back and healthy seat 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 and the super recommend that super stayed 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.349
 good to go you have liked who does
