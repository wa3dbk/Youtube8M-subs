what's going on guys well here back with
someone<00:00:02.550> genetic<00:00:02.939> gladiators<00:00:03.060> they<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:03.929> have

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
someone genetic gladiators they do have

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.820 
someone genetic gladiators they do have
a<00:00:04.589> new<00:00:04.890> Ord<00:00:05.850> system<00:00:06.390> as<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.629> can<00:00:06.660> see<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.290> does

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
a new Ord system as you can see it does

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.390 
a new Ord system as you can see it does
give<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.780> increased<00:00:09.780> attack<00:00:10.230> live<00:00:10.559> crit<00:00:11.040> or

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
give you increased attack live crit or

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.530 
give you increased attack live crit or
increased<00:00:12.710> attributes<00:00:13.710> which<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
increased attributes which is going to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
increased attributes which is going to
help<00:00:15.929> us<00:00:16.760> quite<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> bit<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.770> campaign<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
help us quite a bit in like campaign and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.859 
help us quite a bit in like campaign and
stuff<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:22.850> PvP<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.449> gonna<00:00:24.600> be

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
stuff like that but in PvP it's gonna be

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.679 
stuff like that but in PvP it's gonna be
pretty<00:00:25.859> hard<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.490> figure<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.390> people

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
pretty hard to figure out what people

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
pretty hard to figure out what people
have<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:29.189> they're<00:00:29.369> actually<00:00:29.550> using

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
have on or what they're actually using

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.920 
have on or what they're actually using
but<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> number<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.270> orb<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.980> be

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
but the number on the orb is going to be

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
but the number on the orb is going to be
the<00:00:36.930> higher<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> number<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> better<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the higher the number the better it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
the higher the number the better it's
gonna<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.760> 2<00:00:38.969> right<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> limited

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
gonna be so the 2 right now is a limited

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.880 
gonna be so the 2 right now is a limited
offer<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:41.489> increased<00:00:41.910> life<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.739> could

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
offer it's increased life so it could

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
offer it's increased life so it could
probably<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.210> tanks<00:00:45.719> if

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
probably use this on like your tanks if

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.889 
probably use this on like your tanks if
you<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.559> life<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.539> defense

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you want more life when in a defense

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.979 
you want more life when in a defense
team<00:00:49.579> or<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> use<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.600> faster

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
team or you can use it on your faster

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
team or you can use it on your faster
mutants<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.190> life<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.670> survive

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
mutants to get more life so they survive

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.459 
mutants to get more life so they survive
a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.300> bit<00:00:54.449> longer<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.199> gonna<00:00:55.289> be

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a little bit longer but we're gonna be

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.029 
a little bit longer but we're gonna be
buying<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.539> just<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.719> case<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.680> ain't

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
buying two of them just in case I ain't

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.660 
buying two of them just in case I ain't
gonna<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.280> putting<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.690> anything

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
gonna be putting them in to anything

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.810 
gonna be putting them in to anything
just<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> Orb<00:01:04.640> system<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
just because right now the Orb system is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
just because right now the Orb system is
kind<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> still<00:01:06.450> buggy<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:08.420> once<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
kind of still buggy and once you put it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
kind of still buggy and once you put it
into<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.860> cannot<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> only

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
into me you cannot take it out the only

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.499 
into me you cannot take it out the only
way<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> new<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
way to put a new one in is just to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
way to put a new one in is just to
replace<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> old<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.400> some<00:01:17.400> humans<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.909> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
replace the old one some humans do have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.020 
replace the old one some humans do have
to<00:01:18.950> warp<00:01:19.950> slots<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.880> three<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
to warp slots and some have three so

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.289 
to warp slots and some have three so
robot<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.950> orb<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:27.180> has

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
robot has one orb and then the he has

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.330 
robot has one orb and then the he has
one<00:01:27.509> special<00:01:27.720> orb<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.890> mean<00:01:29.040> has

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
one special orb so like this mean has

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
one special orb so like this mean has
two<00:01:29.700> regular<00:01:30.450> orbs<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.170> special<00:01:31.439> orb<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
two regular orbs and one special orb so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.429 
two regular orbs and one special orb so
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> three<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.200> one

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
you can have up to three on this one

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.050 
you can have up to three on this one
which<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:36.439> pretty<00:01:37.439> nice

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
which is pretty nice

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.770 
which is pretty nice
the<00:01:39.509> other<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.960> gonna<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.799> your

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
the other two are gonna be for like your

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.730 
the other two are gonna be for like your
attribute<00:01:42.780> depending<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.500> mutant

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
attribute depending on what your mutant

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
attribute depending on what your mutant
is<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.549> wounded<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.420> wound

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
is this one is gonna be wounded or wound

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.600 
is this one is gonna be wounded or wound
and<00:01:47.180> then<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> special<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.100> really

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and then the special one it's a really

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.499 
and then the special one it's a really
tanky<00:01:50.970> mutant<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.750> attack<00:01:53.270> it's<00:01:54.270> probably

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
tanky mutant so attack it's probably

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
tanky mutant so attack it's probably
gonna<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.840> better<00:01:55.020> option<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.770> wait

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
gonna be your better option I would wait

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
gonna be your better option I would wait
till<00:01:56.189> they<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> better<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.909> plus<00:01:57.210> five<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
till they have a better one plus five is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
till they have a better one plus five is
not<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.770> much<00:01:58.979> I'll<00:01:59.189> wait<00:01:59.369> till<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.700> have

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
not that much I'll wait till they have

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.230 
not that much I'll wait till they have
the<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> second<00:02:01.759> tier<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.000> which

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the probably the second tier one which

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.690 
the probably the second tier one which
would<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.930> plus<00:02:04.500> ten<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:05.009> just

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
would probably be plus ten I'm just

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
would probably be plus ten I'm just
guessing<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.439> I'm

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
guessing here but that's what I'm

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.490 
guessing here but that's what I'm
guessing<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.039> gonna<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:09.140> yeah<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> would<00:02:10.349> wait

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
guessing it's gonna be yeah I would wait

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.390 
guessing it's gonna be yeah I would wait
till<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.890> higher<00:02:11.099> ones<00:02:11.430> I'm

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
till they have higher ones I'm

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.500 
till they have higher ones I'm
pretty<00:02:12.760> sure<00:02:12.970> they're<00:02:13.090> gonna<00:02:13.180> start<00:02:13.450> coming

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
pretty sure they're gonna start coming

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.869 
pretty sure they're gonna start coming
out<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:13.930> 3/4<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:14.980> higher<00:02:15.189> level<00:02:15.670> ones

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
out with like 3/4 like higher level ones

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.199 
out with like 3/4 like higher level ones
so<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.239> start<00:02:16.480> paying<00:02:16.750> more<00:02:16.959> or<00:02:17.879> like<00:02:18.879> just

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
so you start paying more or like just

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.199 
so you start paying more or like just
have<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.370> continue<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:21.579> on<00:02:21.610> maybe<00:02:22.000> they'll

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
have it continue to go on maybe they'll

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.300 
have it continue to go on maybe they'll
have<00:02:22.329> some<00:02:22.390> special<00:02:22.989> awards<00:02:23.290> or<00:02:23.829> stuff<00:02:24.129> like

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
have some special awards or stuff like

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.170 
have some special awards or stuff like
that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.839 
that
a<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.720> interesting<00:02:25.870> system<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.610> it's

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
a really interesting system but it's

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.759 
a really interesting system but it's
still<00:02:28.209> buggy<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.840> really<00:02:29.379> wouldn't<00:02:29.590> play

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
still buggy so I really wouldn't play

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.679 
still buggy so I really wouldn't play
around<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.159> we'll<00:02:30.310> play<00:02:30.849> around<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.420> too

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
around it we'll play around with it too

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.539 
around it we'll play around with it too
much<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:32.170> am<00:02:32.230> gonna<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.709> trying<00:02:33.010> some<00:02:33.250> today

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
gets lost or anything like that if it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.369 
gets lost or anything like that if it
does<00:02:39.879> I'm<00:02:40.120> fine<00:02:40.420> with<00:02:40.810> it

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
does I'm fine with it

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.990 
does I'm fine with it

using those because I don't want to lose

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.750 
using those because I don't want to lose
those<00:02:47.470> ones<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:47.920> we'll<00:02:48.129> be<00:02:48.250> buying<00:02:48.430> some<00:02:48.730> of

the other regular like 70 attribute ones

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.280 
the other regular like 70 attribute ones
and<00:02:53.620> we'll<00:02:54.609> test<00:02:54.909> those<00:02:55.389> out<00:02:55.659> I'm<00:02:55.989> not<00:02:56.170> too

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and we'll test those out I'm not too

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.319 
and we'll test those out I'm not too
sure<00:02:56.440> if<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.680> can<00:02:56.829> stack<00:02:57.159> like<00:02:57.700> double<00:02:58.090> wound

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
sure if you can stack like double wound

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.199 
sure if you can stack like double wound
or<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.799> only<00:02:59.920> have<00:03:00.159> one<00:03:00.189> or<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.939> other

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
we're gonna be testing that out as well

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.940 
we're gonna be testing that out as well
but<00:03:05.680> yeah<00:03:06.189> let's<00:03:06.430> check<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.849> out<00:03:06.909> right<00:03:07.030> now

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
but yeah let's check that out right now

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.800 
but yeah let's check that out right now
we'll<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.069> with<00:03:09.370> project<00:03:09.819> that's<00:03:09.970> 27<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:10.629> as<00:03:10.720> I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
we'll go with project that's 27 but as I

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.170 
we'll go with project that's 27 but as I
do<00:03:10.870> use<00:03:11.230> them<00:03:11.349> along<00:03:11.650> he<00:03:12.129> does<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.489> retaliate

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
do use them along he does have retaliate

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.699 
do use them along he does have retaliate
damage<00:03:13.569> so<00:03:13.689> we're<00:03:13.810> gonna<00:03:13.900> go<00:03:14.079> over<00:03:14.200> here<00:03:14.560> and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
damage so we're gonna go over here and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.640 
damage so we're gonna go over here and
look<00:03:15.549> for<00:03:15.879> that<00:03:16.299> damage<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.079> it's<00:03:17.349> gonna<00:03:17.500> be

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
look for that damage and it's gonna be

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.189 
look for that damage and it's gonna be
right<00:03:17.859> here<00:03:17.889> plus<00:03:18.549> 7%<00:03:20.489> first<00:03:21.489> here<00:03:22.199> hopefully

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
right here plus 7% first here hopefully

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.300 
right here plus 7% first here hopefully
we<00:03:23.410> actually<00:03:23.739> get<00:03:23.829> some<00:03:23.980> better<00:03:24.129> ones

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
we actually get some better ones

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.369 
we actually get some better ones
currently<00:03:24.579> there's<00:03:24.940> only<00:03:25.090> eight<00:03:25.419> for<00:03:26.139> free

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
currently there's only eight for free

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.949 
currently there's only eight for free
regular<00:03:26.829> ones<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.280> four<00:03:27.909> for<00:03:28.359> your<00:03:28.629> special

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
regular ones and four for your special

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.250 
regular ones and four for your special
ones<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.359> there<00:03:31.359> have<00:03:31.540> been<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.900> ton<00:03:32.199> of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
ones so there have been a ton of

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.569 
ones so there have been a ton of
problems<00:03:32.500> with<00:03:32.889> this<00:03:33.010> system<00:03:33.190> currently

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
problems with this system currently

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.960 
problems with this system currently
they'll<00:03:34.329> probably<00:03:34.629> fix<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.319> course<00:03:35.970> there

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
they'll probably fix it of course there

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.069 
they'll probably fix it of course there
have<00:03:37.060> been<00:03:37.120> problems<00:03:37.359> where<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.599> can't<00:03:37.810> equip

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
have been problems where you can't equip

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.050 
have been problems where you can't equip
them<00:03:38.230> they<00:03:38.440> overlap<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.400> stuff<00:03:39.639> like<00:03:39.849> this

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
them they overlap and stuff like this

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.030 
them they overlap and stuff like this
and<00:03:40.389> why<00:03:41.169> don't<00:03:41.229> you<00:03:41.349> actually<00:03:41.500> bring<00:03:41.769> up<00:03:41.919> like

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
and why don't you actually bring up like

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.610 
and why don't you actually bring up like
a<00:03:42.099> little<00:03:42.400> inventory<00:03:42.940> menu<00:03:43.530> where<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.560> can

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
a little inventory menu where you can

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.839 
a little inventory menu where you can
actually<00:03:44.829> buy<00:03:45.040> them<00:03:45.159> from<00:03:45.540> shop<00:03:46.540> stats<00:03:47.849> that's

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
actually buy them from shop stats that's

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.280 
actually buy them from shop stats that's
very<00:03:49.120> interesting<00:03:49.419> I<00:03:49.659> did<00:03:49.840> not<00:03:50.049> know<00:03:50.260> that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
very interesting I did not know that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.430 
very interesting I did not know that
would<00:03:50.620> pop<00:03:50.799> up<00:03:50.829> let's<00:03:51.729> equip<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.449> retaliate

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
would pop up let's equip the retaliate

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.319 
would pop up let's equip the retaliate
one<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.979> we<00:03:54.250> there's<00:03:54.549> no<00:03:54.760> way<00:03:54.909> to<00:03:54.970> get<00:03:55.180> these

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
one and we there's no way to get these

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.869 
one and we there's no way to get these
back<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.750> cannot<00:03:56.199> take<00:03:56.500> them<00:03:56.650> out<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.489> only

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
back you cannot take them out the only

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.360 
back you cannot take them out the only
way<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.870> can<00:03:59.019> add<00:03:59.229> a<00:03:59.260> better<00:03:59.500> one<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.889> is<00:04:00.129> to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
way you can add a better one in is to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.390 
way you can add a better one in is to
replace<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.150> one<00:04:01.359> previously<00:04:02.319> on<00:04:02.560> there<00:04:02.799> so

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
replace the one previously on there so

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.800 
replace the one previously on there so
if<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.549> wanted<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.819> put<00:04:04.000> in<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.209> level<00:04:04.419> to<00:04:04.569> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
if I wanted to put in a level to the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.960 
if I wanted to put in a level to the
level<00:04:05.079> one<00:04:05.349> would<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:05.650> gone<00:04:05.829> forever<00:04:06.069> so

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
level one would be gone forever so

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.729 
level one would be gone forever so
that's<00:04:07.359> why<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.599> said<00:04:07.840> wait<00:04:08.109> till<00:04:08.139> they<00:04:08.560> have

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
that's why I said wait till they have

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.640 
that's why I said wait till they have
higher<00:04:09.010> tier<00:04:09.370> ones<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:11.290> don't<00:04:11.440> want<00:04:11.560> to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
higher tier ones if you don't want to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.020 
higher tier ones if you don't want to
wait<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:11.799> would<00:04:12.010> just<00:04:12.129> do<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.400> mutants<00:04:12.669> use<00:04:12.849> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
wait I would just do the mutants use the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.219 
wait I would just do the mutants use the
most<00:04:13.239> or<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.720> ones<00:04:13.870> you're<00:04:13.959> going<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.139> be

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
most or the ones you're going to be

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:19.229 
most or the ones you're going to be
using<00:04:14.349> PvP<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.310> or<00:04:16.260> campaign<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:18.220> use<00:04:18.820> Project

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239

PPP<00:04:51.010> is<00:04:51.160> going<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.580> be<00:04:51.700> 10<00:04:52.150> times<00:04:52.450> harder

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
PPP is going to be 10 times harder

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.330 
PPP is going to be 10 times harder
because<00:04:53.290> you're<00:04:53.440> not<00:04:53.620> gonna<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.860> able<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.130> see
