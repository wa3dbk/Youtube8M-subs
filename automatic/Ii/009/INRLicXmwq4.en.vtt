00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.269
 teach how to do the are you watching 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.660
 disney chanel making actors 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.020
 disney ok the only thing we have to do 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.000
 is to download the video that are the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.560
 mickey ears drawing for 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.160
 can you draw them 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.009
 ok and you have to record or record to the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.699
 person that you want to do that 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.699
 drawing mickey ears 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 ok once this is done we take the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.739
 Mickey ears to stick and pro 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.739
 we put up here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 and then we go down a little bit 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 and we take the video of the person who 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.880
 want to do this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 and you put it under ok very easy so that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.650
 as you can see here it's just going to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 appear red and you will not see your 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.690
 good what you have to do to make 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 you see is here above the red video 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.619
 with mickey ears you're going to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.619
 have to give here on this lever 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.280
 Once this is done you will go to key 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.450
 chromatic are what you have to do 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.450
 is to explain it 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 and they make you accept everything that appears 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.220
 colors as you can see here put me 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.160
 blue is automatically look you see 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.390
 is what I was saying good then 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.810
 what we have to do here the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 run red and go up and choose 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 the red more or less that is better and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.740
 you have to be able to see better 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.650
 Oh 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.590
 and you can finish making some details 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.590
 here when it seems you look better 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.550
 okay 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.940
 I'm going to improve a bit this does not seem 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.940
 that looks 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.120
 once done this we need to move 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.120
 this put a little smaller 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.090
 and we're going to have to go to masks 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.460
 here next to give you enable here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.290
 click and you will have to remove the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.290
 edges by clicking each point 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.180
 very carefully because you can not stay 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.870
 not a little black because then 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.990
 looks bad once done you'll 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.730
 be without those tips then we're going to 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.560
 opposition what we want and already what 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.560
 we can move as more is used 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.180
 As you can see, you are being draped 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.830
 you will not be drawing the well that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.110
 it's because you have to edit it well if 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.400
 what you have to do here is 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.260
 take it away is what you're going to have to move 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.260
 I agree that you draw it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.319
 Well yes there is drawing the series of 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.989
 hits ok then what we have to 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.950
 to do is cut back the video a bit 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.370
 part that is left over 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.680
 I think giving more face 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.040
 and we are going to remove the little part that 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.040
 surplus 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.420
 and staying at each point and removing it 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.640
 here the note section appears as 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.740
 you can see it has left you then 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.330
 there will only be left 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.360
 uncoordinated and you will not go upa 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.900
 true ok what you have to do is 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.850
 move what you are going to reproduce and we are going to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.860
 give stop 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.410
 when you doing what is what 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.270
 let's do is move it 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.270
 until I'm drawing that part 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.370
 and as you can see, you will be left 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.370
 better 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.340
 ready you want is the music obviously 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.690
 from Disney 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.169
 you have to do it is easy only 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.820
 download the mp3 that I have good for you 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.419
 save it we go here in the video and 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.740
 they make you perform as I recommend 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.060
 this one that is going to be 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 we wait a moment 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.610
 okay 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.160
 I recommend windows media video and that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.500
 you give in 180 is the best quality and you 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.200
 it's very good here you can change the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.200
 name and where you're going to keep it 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.040
 do I look like I have done no 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.040
 I'm going to render it 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.710
 and you will have something like this 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.800
 what he has to do is now 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.980
 let's use windows live movie 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.980
 maker 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.979
 taking the video 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.420
 the video here 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.720
 and putting the music mp3 that I'm going to 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.720
 leave 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:49.539
 music and it's how you can listen in 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.539
 the music of when something like that 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.060
 you can put it back together and that's how you 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.759
 it is much longer then you 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.350
 I recommend that before here 6 mobile and you 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:08.510
 do for high definition display and here 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.850
 ok and he's going to start saving 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:15.250
 with a lot of work putting a 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.250
 introduction that can get 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.110
