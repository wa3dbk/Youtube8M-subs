00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.360
 three months ago 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.549
 I am here again 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.549
 in the sense of returns the travel time 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.739
 14 30 euros 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.339
 also for many 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.390
 anyway strongly 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.249
 nameless kadhafi 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.650
 layton 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 today than ten years ago 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.070
 siren data 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 I do not see why 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 authorities 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 it was going too far 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.250
 for me and for my son 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880
 see the report 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 and I will try very rare 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 honestly 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.600
 another law 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 I did not understand 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 because he's scared 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050
 3 years asaÃ¯s 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380

 why am I here we will see 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.959
 for which he 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.959
 the outputs are 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.489
 in reality 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.489
 however, the detour 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 that's why I'm here 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.139
 ballistics 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.329
