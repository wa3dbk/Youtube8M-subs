00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
publications now as far you know again

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.060 
publications now as far you know again
this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.460> based<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.060> New<00:01:27.240> South<00:01:27.509> Wales<00:01:27.570> law<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this is based in New South Wales law but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
this is based in New South Wales law but
it<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:30.150> far<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> understand

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it as far as I understand

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
it as far as I understand
internationally<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.460> move<00:01:32.700> towards

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
internationally there's we move towards

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
internationally there's we move towards
plain<00:01:33.810> language<00:01:34.140> contracts<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.850> if

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
plain language contracts so I think if

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
plain language contracts so I think if
you<00:01:36.299> write<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:37.439> clearly<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:38.820> you're

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you write out really clearly what you're

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
you write out really clearly what you're
going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> use<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> images<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.500> rights

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
going to use the images for what rights

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
going to use the images for what rights
you<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:41.759> recourse<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you have and what recourse they have it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
you have and what recourse they have it
should<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.520> clear<00:01:45.060> enough<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:45.810> sure

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
should be clear enough just make sure

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it's clear to both parties it can be a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's clear to both parties it can be a
little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.909> daunting<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> ask<00:01:48.689> someone<00:01:49.079> to

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
see my earlier video for a discussion of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720 
see my earlier video for a discussion of
what<00:03:42.870> commercial<00:03:43.349> purposes<00:03:43.859> is<00:03:43.919> but<00:03:44.609> that's

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
what commercial purposes is but that's

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.610 
what commercial purposes is but that's
