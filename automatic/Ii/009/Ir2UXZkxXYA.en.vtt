00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 high school here and in this video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 It's about how you learn as a woman 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.580
 can better assess men with it 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.920
 you do not get the wrong way and from 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.690
 disappointments are spared and me 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.670
 tell you five steps how it works 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 determines that you often go to the loo 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 when it comes to men and you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.570
 Do not want to be disappointed again 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.939
 become 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 and not to be disappointed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.550
 important that you are not mistaken as it is 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.070
 at the beginning 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 which is already in the word in it because 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 if you do not know enough about the man 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 Do you have a wrong picture of him? 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 So below is a deception and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 to get the right picture of him 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 had to ask him the right questions 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 or the right things 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.440
 Talk about what I clarify first as a woman 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.489
 What kind of things would he have in his life? 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.950
 would like to reach 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the short term and in the long run because 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.860
 If, for example, he likes for one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.879
 flying abroad to australia 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.670
 for example 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 it is clear from the outset that he is not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 relationship in Germany together 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.440
 will 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 so that you are several times a week 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.730
 See it would be at most one 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 But the relationship between them also ends 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.930
 if the case does not apply it is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.689
 important for his long-term goals 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.420
 to ask how he is living in 10 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.010
 or 20 years old once learns 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.229
 you there to get to know very well and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.549
 On the other hand, that is an issue for them 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.100
 Each individual can tell 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.450
 and there is never too embarrassing 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 conversation breaks if you are a candidate 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 caught the plan anything great 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 no vision has what he wants to achieve 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 I would think in any case 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 if it is the right one because if he wants to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 example professionally do not know where it is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.270
 should go to the relationship technology 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.180
 until probably as well as there is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 yes not the man the man who knows what 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 he wants one can only plan everything 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 many things are different than you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 thinks it is only important that he 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 at least about the imagination of the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.020
 clarify future as a second thing worthy 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.939
 which ideology has 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.200
 or what things he believes 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 and what he thinks right 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.799
 In everyday life , it has to be fast 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.469
 Conflicts come when the one vegan 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.780
 is and nothing other than state 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.450
 official comes or if he is always in 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.490
 the meadows 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.709
 so has no money and you are saving 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.239
 the money problems the 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.040
 the more jointness all the more 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.290
 it is more likely that the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 relationship that is permanent as a third 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.519
 It should clear out which loses 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.400
 relationship comes closer and which 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.870
 relationships he has received lived 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 For example, if he is a divorcee 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.989
 is he could have trouble himself 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.489
 want to bind firmly 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.530
 I do not want to generalize that 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.720
 You have to clarify this individually 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.730
 It is also important to know who 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.250
 his family is and to see if 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.590
 his fit together with your family 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.209
 and if they can understand each other 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.519
 After all, you do not want it to be one later 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.260
 shootout on a wedding gives as 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.090
 fourth I would ask how much to him 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 So a relationship means which one 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.750
 if there is a relationship with his 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.340
 has life and how much he has in the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.160
 would invest partner city 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730
 both emotionally and temporally 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.950
 seen 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.780
 Maybe the career is great and is 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.069
 he looks for a laid-back affaire because 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.959
 you do a lot of work in the moment 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.190
 more important is what would i do 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.950
 do not take it personally 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.870
 You also have others guaranteed 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.840
 priorities therefore do not worry 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.609
 and last but not least from what he for 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.590
 my friends have always the 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.510
 intersected with the people 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.010
 So he gives in the most 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.310
 specific areas in any case 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.630
 similar characteristics as his friends 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.010
 because he relationship people and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.709
 his circle of friends is 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.359
 more likely that he too 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.340
 inclusion as being 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.650

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.470
