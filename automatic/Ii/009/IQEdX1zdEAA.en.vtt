00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.210
 hello everyone today we get 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.010
 found for a new tutorial and it will be 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.090
 to bring back so a dish 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.160
 japanese for the bowl you use the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.140
 color you want here I used 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.910
 the granite color of g.skill peace but 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.460
 you can use white very well 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.619
 or black or then makes a ball of 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.750
 this dough and you will need a 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.020
 tool with round ends or something 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.120
 of round that you will cover with talcum 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.610
 so that the dough hangs on 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.010
 and you just put your dough around 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.829
 of your tool to make the shape 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.409
 rounded bowl 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.589
 and then with a blade you go 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:54.469
 come remove the excess dough you 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.979
 will come to make the edges of 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.979
 your bowl 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.839
 you tumble and thanks to the talent that it 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.820
 is very easy 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.070
 I advise you to put your bowl to 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 to cook before doing the following for 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.240
 prevent them from being deformed and it allows 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 also after cooking to file the edges 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.490
 with just a nail file 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.710
 for the sauce I use fimo 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 liquid with dry pastels rap is 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.180
 in shades of brown orange strand 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.649
 yellow finely grate your pastels and 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.450
 did not put a lot back because that 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.890
 mixes very easily with fimo 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.060
 liquid it does not take much for 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 reach and and you put this mixture 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.020
 in your bowl 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.110
 without going to the edges to avoid 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.990
 it overflows when you add 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.240
 the other elements brings back 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.310
 sahara with vanilla and you there 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 add a little translucent and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.549
 yellow you make a fine sausage with this 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.130
 mix that you 're going to cut into 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.380
 pieces of different sizes and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.740
 wanted to place in your bowl so 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740
 random 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.200
 you then make a dark green with 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.330
 simply glass and black that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.110
 flatten and cut 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 a rectangle 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.840
 and you will realize some kind of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.250
 grid then so be that and that kind 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.469
 tool I do not know where I told them 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.560
 either with a tip simply 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:38.230
 you make streaks in one direction then 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.459
 you make streaks in the other direction 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.620
 to have a grid and you come 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.230
 place it in your bowl while leaving it 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.230
 go beyond the grid inwards 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.189
 you mix sahara with a little 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.040
 little caramel you make a pudding 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.560
 pretty thick of this mix you just 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.599
 hue and especially the ride with 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.909
 dry pastels in shades of brown but 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:12.060
 dark enough and you just cut out 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.060
 slices 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 that you just textured 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.340
 and place in your bowl 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.349
 for the offer you come to make a ball 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 white that you narrow down a little 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.700
 side with a tool type doudine tool 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.560
 you come to make a little hole on 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.480
 which you add a little bit of 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.000
 yellow so I do not have enough flattened 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.739
 the egg do not hesitate to do it and you 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.290
 come work a little bit the edges 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:06.810
 yellow before placing your egg in 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.700
 the bowl you mix raspberry pink 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.910
 with translucent at about the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.370
 equivalent amount flatten you from the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.519
 white and you superimposed with your 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.040
 mix of rose then cut you 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.040
 it's all the same size in a rectangle 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.520
 you add a little white to 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.520
 one end and you wrap it all up 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:37.289
 you then enlarge this pudding 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.289
 that you slice 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.170
 and with a tip type tool you go 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.910
 come do like these small ones 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.910
 notches all the way around 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.070
 and it only remains to place them in 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.090
 your bowl you make sausages 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.340
 different glasses that you put in 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.620
 to cook and after cooking you go them 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.750
 cut into small pieces makes the same 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.710
 thing with green dough balls that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.750
 you go leather and then shredded place a 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.880
 then this mixture of golden fismes and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.480
 two randomly cut movies on 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.480
