side-by-side comparison and do a little

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.479 
side-by-side comparison and do a little
finessing<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.150> product<00:02:35.100> less<00:02:36.100> amount<00:02:36.400> of

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
finessing of the product less amount of

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.699 
finessing of the product less amount of
retouching<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.570> do<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.840> something<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
retouching that we do to something the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.170 
retouching that we do to something the
less<00:02:38.860> perfect<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.340> looks<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:39.730> actually<00:02:40.090> it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
less perfect it looks but actually it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.340 
less perfect it looks but actually it
looks<00:02:40.300> more<00:02:40.450> appetizing<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.200> more

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
looks more appetizing and more

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.040 
looks more appetizing and more
convincing<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.910> just<00:02:43.120> enhancing<00:02:43.660> some<00:02:43.840> color

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
convincing but just enhancing some color

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.110 
convincing but just enhancing some color
taking<00:02:44.530> out<00:02:44.680> some<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.250> little<00:02:45.640> accents<00:02:46.030> it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
taking out some of the little accents it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.310 
taking out some of the little accents it
might<00:02:46.239> happen<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.690> preparation<00:02:47.200> which

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
might happen in preparation which

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.840 
might happen in preparation which
obviously<00:02:47.530> doesn't<00:02:47.830> show<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> product<00:02:48.760> in

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
obviously doesn't show the product in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.050 
obviously doesn't show the product in
its<00:02:48.910> best<00:02:49.150> possible<00:02:49.360> light<00:02:50.850> here<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.940> can

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
its best possible light here you can

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.160 
its best possible light here you can
definitely<00:02:52.180> see<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.630> there's<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.959> size

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
definitely see that there's a size

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.500 
definitely see that there's a size
difference<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.580> Box<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.060> are<00:02:55.180> saying<00:02:55.390> which

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
difference the Box that are saying which

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.120 
difference the Box that are saying which
does<00:02:55.660> come<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.049> keep<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.590> which<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.830> warm

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
does come in keep this a which is warm

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.860 
does come in keep this a which is warm
so<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.489> creates<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> bit<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> steam<00:02:58.299> effect

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
so it creates a bit of a steam effect

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.449 
so it creates a bit of a steam effect
and<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.230> does<00:02:59.350> make<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> button<00:02:59.920> contract<00:03:00.340> a

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
and it does make the button contract a

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.460 
and it does make the button contract a
little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> main<00:03:02.080> difference

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
little bit and then the main difference

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.020 
little bit and then the main difference
is<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.680> fact<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.280> actually<00:03:03.430> took<00:03:03.850> all

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
is the fact that we actually took all

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.310 
is the fact that we actually took all
the<00:03:04.150> ingredients<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.810> normally<00:03:05.110> hidden

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the ingredients that are normally hidden

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.690 
the ingredients that are normally hidden
under<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.769> bun<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.100> pulled<00:03:06.340> them<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
under the bun and we pulled them to the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.610 
under the bun and we pulled them to the
foreground<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.840> can<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.200> them<00:03:08.380> and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
foreground so that you can see them and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.740 
foreground so that you can see them and
those<00:03:08.890> are<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.070> main<00:03:09.190> differences<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:10.030> Isobel
