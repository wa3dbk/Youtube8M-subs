 quickly throw something away for food which is not very much that in principle 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.260
 still have second and the water rich then it can of course 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.729
 do not record 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:11.980
 because who else? 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.609
 UBS too 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.749
 Real are 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.329
 you have it would be involuntarily exciting 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 you are also covered from head to toe by her 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 Although net will land here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
 so would have to die to thank you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.590
 nice under net media down 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 SID 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.990
 Sack of coffee 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 and because he's so economical, but this time he steps in the right way 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 that was real now can not believe what I did there 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.670
 but good that her husband is purely here 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.840
 to my 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.450
 Dearest saleswoman 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.070
 Subsets k 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 it is not the purchased one 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390
 I want to sell 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390
 and this time really 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.050
 So now the beginning with the whole street is enough for her iron big ax 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.370
 that can be Red Harald 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.470
 9:30 am is a little too little money on 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.960
 90 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.370
 So 4 40 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.450
 Schackstedt clearly that they make themselves 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.620
 Okayama make of the 8 thats also a joker 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.620
 that is his 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.810
 but war on the 8th 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.939
 the Guide al-Qaida Fine Star as 2 billion more 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.939
 have received 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.880
 the product so the line falls the way the state still remains 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.240
 Parts keep I was sometimes through folding walls with the bow yet again 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.930
 Job" 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.369
 Morsals made who do not feel like an example can endure 50 years 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.790
 now maybe I want to get the 3000 gold for the youth 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 radiant so tragic 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.150
 Gibbs was well defended image but otherwise all way but all the gold for that 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.330
 they collected 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.180
 and there I have the trend according to 1000 gold we can do this 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.259
 happens 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.889
 because the daycare 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.489
 but we also need the ATX 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.569
 5 was actually wearing her I should actually wear more rings 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.829
 can 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.159
 that would interest me now 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.379
 I think I think you can the 2 question two ranks 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 or one can of the respective kind 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.179
 Barca ManU Rheingau I from Rostock II 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.809
 it is not her thing 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.989
 not so bad 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.739
 not so bad not so bad Port Sudan we will give it all up 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 and April is definitely saying the way here 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.589
 SUT the kids and videos that are vastly still the important ones soon 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 the lighting director Karl Maier presents 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.859
 That's not worth the odds 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.499
 Strength will be drank and maybe ever 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.099
 So I keep that 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.060
 the root I also retain the life energy reigned one who 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.219
 No one can do anything with meat 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.579
 overall, but can be gone 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:16.559
 this lowers 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.559
 can also go way 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.139
 I can crab meat there 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.149
 that can also cook the leaf on it then Lecter 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.149
 the fight companions enjoyed meat start 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.369
 Give Safar Cermak a chance to stay that way Haifa 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.449
 time does not come too much 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.899
 that's so unnecessary palace 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:41.719
 Skeletons of wax damage from there also wants to be sweet cakes 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.260
 Porsche except GM you also keep on the Internet at www train 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.969
 Although brought 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.349
 animals 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.559
 laughs judge put down 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.069
 at the Magic Apprenticeship 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.069
 who knows Marek grapes important 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:05.169
 but the doubts have been retained but there is a 40 degree so get away 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.929
 as an old cisco, Baker also sells salt 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.549
 Zimmermann I decided so bitter that we have to clean up in the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.099
 heated rooms too 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.000
 should the oyster roll so no we keep the invisibility anyway 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:22.049
 Benefit also Arkan blow even full of sleep need light 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.310
 also about Colin Firth about the physics and that's great 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.419
 and the prices were that you wonder if you can do anything with it 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.169
 with the ingot 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.169
 That's why I prefer to keep Dietrich every time 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.250
 So rather Zermatt Kunath shovel is enough - that's all Bäuerle's tool 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.659
 Spokane II 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.799
 and you did not think I had postage after Pocking 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.319
 then I thank you again when Apple do the business 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.529
 I ask again to be taken photo 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.529
 and that further revealed 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.659
 so and finally take the chance and I go back up the road here 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.650
 and U.S 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.319
 but very short percent 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.460
 the sword of ours 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.460
 Friend Poland 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.840
 For the first time on 120 gold I think so we can do it for about 80 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.840
 sell and 80 percent sold so right 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.429
 and the more gold we have that I do not care, the smoking are also the 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.819
 whole occupy stuff 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
 and we all benefit from it 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.009
 Percent feed or thank you 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.539
 and once upon a time we in 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.339
 this view closer to Schug 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.379
 that's enough then again 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.379
 and there's another short return Grafite 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.919
 and acrobatics has improved again, said the chancellor, we laugh too 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.529
 the best is Deuce 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.729
 was dragged decrepit 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.259
 Karsai did not have wolf not discouraged actively are welcome 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.659
 Precious knowledge similar to fruit self-taught skills 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.330
 bad for the pace and 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.840
 as far as we are for the sake of saying they are simply self-taught to business 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.949
 already technically bad or 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.839
 can be seen 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.839
 Sigh gave birth to the drift and I told her Koske 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.749
 Andor well with her 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.749
 okay so more about the weapon then unfortunately 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.800
 520 gold embroidered 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.389
 and now Persever wants Dichand for reprinting mass this quest on himself 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.159
 Has 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.430
 exactly 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.250
 Too tight with fraud was when I was especially valuable and snowshoes 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.419
 i should bring these early ones they are well paid for 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.150
 So that means nothing more than finding a school that does ours 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.639
 Thoughts whether she might fall the strong one or not 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:06.090
 GM shopping could be GM GM could 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.139
 and now I finally want to go to the castle again to search 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.479
 the year used to be here somewhere 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.590
 can not be far from here what exactly does the tester mean 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.629
 Percent in bar and percent avoids him I have to look for a blacksmith 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.830
 the game is still there 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.830
 maybe I should talk to him 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.129
 there Malte is indeed lubricated 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:36.930
 Well, I'm curious 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.689
 what the snow says far back » 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.619
 and there is more Alba experienced our past 

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:43.949
 the experience you can read here
