should be straight and true with no word

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.759 
should be straight and true with no word
if<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.659> have<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> worn<00:02:52.639> plunger<00:02:53.639> shaft<00:02:54.500> all<00:02:55.500> of

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
if you have a worn plunger shaft all of

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.050 
if you have a worn plunger shaft all of
this<00:02:55.919> year<00:02:56.189> is<00:02:56.370> for<00:02:56.760> note<00:02:58.069> but<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.579> see<00:02:59.819> that

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
this year is for note but you see that

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.569 
this year is for note but you see that
the<00:03:00.299> plunger<00:03:00.750> actually<00:03:01.409> works<00:03:01.709> really<00:03:02.099> really

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
the plunger actually works really really

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.899 
the plunger actually works really really
free<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.590> pressure<00:03:07.919> on<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.489> spring

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
free and the pressure on that spring

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.899 
free and the pressure on that spring
pushes<00:03:09.870> down<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.739> packing<00:03:11.220> gland<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
pushes down on that packing gland and

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.309 
pushes down on that packing gland and
that's<00:03:12.720> what<00:03:12.989> seals<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.560> unit<00:03:14.069> up<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.260> to

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
that's what seals the unit up now now to

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.050 
that's what seals the unit up now now to
make<00:03:16.709> these<00:03:16.949> easy<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.790> install<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:20.819> you

get go I'm going when I put this fill
pump<00:03:37.229> on<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.560> engine<00:03:37.979> I'm<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:39.000> remove

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
pump on the engine I'm going to remove

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.170 
pump on the engine I'm going to remove
the<00:03:39.780> flywheel<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.919> so<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.819> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the flywheel so that so that you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.289 
the flywheel so that so that you
actually<00:03:42.389> can<00:03:42.750> see<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.199> what<00:03:43.620> we're<00:03:43.859> doing

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
actually can see what what we're doing

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.789 
actually can see what what we're doing
but<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.449> actually<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:46.079> put<00:03:46.290> all<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
but you actually can put all of this

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.699 
but you actually can put all of this
together<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.519> an<00:03:47.819> engine<00:03:48.329> without<00:03:48.900> removing

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
together on an engine without removing

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.659 
together on an engine without removing
the<00:03:49.829> flywheel<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.840> do<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.609> quite<00:03:53.609> often<00:03:55.310> on<00:03:56.310> this

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
the flywheel I do it quite often on this

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.539 
the flywheel I do it quite often on this
this<00:03:57.120> type<00:03:57.419> engine<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.989> don't<00:03:58.199> own<00:03:58.889> any<00:03:59.370> of

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
this type engine you don't own any of

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.250 
this type engine you don't own any of
these<00:03:59.699> fuel<00:04:00.030> pumps<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.479> do<00:04:00.599> not<00:04:00.780> have<00:04:01.079> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
these fuel pumps you do not have to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.879 
these fuel pumps you do not have to
remove<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.310> flywheel<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:03.060> work<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.449> the<00:04:03.889> fuel

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
remove the flywheel to work on the fuel

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.760 
remove the flywheel to work on the fuel
pump<00:04:05.269> just<00:04:06.269> let<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.689> be<00:04:06.930> note

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
pump just let that be note

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.520 
pump just let that be note
but<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:10.030> make<00:04:10.240> this<00:04:10.480> easy<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:14.080> want<00:04:14.290> you

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
but to make this easy is you want you

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.300 
but to make this easy is you want you
want<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:15.060> take<00:04:16.060> all<00:04:16.239> attention<00:04:16.660> off<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.350> so

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
want to take all attention off of it so

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.640 
want to take all attention off of it so
you<00:04:18.670> put<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.090> plunger<00:04:19.780> down<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.200> under<00:04:20.500> as

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
you put that plunger down you under as

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.310 
you put that plunger down you under as
far<00:04:21.190> as<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:21.850> will<00:04:22.060> go<00:04:27.420> y'all<00:04:28.420> actually<00:04:28.690> see<00:04:29.140> me

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
bushing in there you know what I don't

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.420 
bushing in there you know what I don't
want<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.550> start<00:04:45.790> up<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.180> dry<00:04:46.540> or<00:04:46.950> dry<00:04:47.950> bushing

plenty free free space right there I
hope<00:06:01.260> that<00:06:01.470> ain't<00:06:01.710> in<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.980> way<00:06:16.310> bleep<00:06:17.310> it<00:06:17.490> okay

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.300 

time<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.480> put<00:06:24.660> that<00:06:24.870> fuel<00:06:25.200> pump<00:06:25.590> on<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:26.130> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
time to put that fuel pump on to the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.040 
time to put that fuel pump on to the
engine<00:06:26.850> so<00:06:26.970> we'll<00:06:27.330> get<00:06:27.570> this

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
engine so we'll get this

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:39.470 
engine so we'll get this
we'll<00:06:29.010> get<00:06:29.160> this<00:06:29.370> flywheel<00:06:29.700> over<00:06:30.300> here<00:06:38.480> and

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
we'll get this flywheel over here and

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.420 
we'll get this flywheel over here and
when<00:06:39.720> I<00:06:39.750> put<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.200> when<00:06:40.350> I<00:06:40.380> bolted<00:06:40.890> all<00:06:41.070> of<00:06:41.280> this

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
when I put it when I bolted all of this

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.110 
when I put it when I bolted all of this
together<00:06:41.730> I<00:06:42.890> put<00:06:43.890> I<00:06:44.130> put<00:06:44.160> this<00:06:44.460> I<00:06:44.640> put<00:06:44.820> a<00:06:44.850> bowl

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
together I put I put this I put a bowl

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.590 
together I put I put this I put a bowl
in<00:06:45.390> there<00:06:45.540> with<00:06:45.780> a<00:06:45.990> with<00:06:46.410> a<00:06:46.440> locking<00:06:46.830> nut<00:06:47.280> on<00:06:47.490> it

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
in there with a with a locking nut on it

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.290 
in there with a with a locking nut on it
a<00:06:48.600> synced<00:06:49.320> up<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:50.280> whole<00:06:50.490> pressure<00:06:50.850> on

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
a synced up the whole pressure on

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.320 
a synced up the whole pressure on
because<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.350> distance<00:06:52.860> from<00:06:53.070> here<00:06:53.490> all<00:06:54.060> the

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
because the distance from here all the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.930 
because the distance from here all the
way<00:06:54.479> around<00:06:54.600> to<00:06:55.050> here<00:06:55.490> there's<00:06:56.490> no<00:06:56.640> pressure

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
way around to here there's no pressure

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.940 
way around to here there's no pressure
on<00:06:57.240> that<00:06:57.510> and<00:06:57.840> I<00:06:58.050> think<00:06:58.260> you<00:06:58.350> know<00:06:58.410> we<00:06:58.560> did<00:06:58.740> put

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
on that and I think you know we did put

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.520 
on that and I think you know we did put
some<00:06:58.979> singer<00:06:59.370> there<00:06:59.700> so<00:06:59.940> I<00:07:00.270> did<00:07:00.960> put<00:07:01.169> that<00:07:01.350> on

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
some singer there so I did put that on
