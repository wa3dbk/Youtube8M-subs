00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
show you what I did if i zoom in on the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.479 
show you what I did if i zoom in on the
front<00:00:43.730> tire<00:00:43.969> hub<00:00:44.300> assembly<00:00:44.780> right<00:00:44.899> here<00:00:45.309> by<00:00:46.309> my

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
front tire hub assembly right here by my

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.549 
front tire hub assembly right here by my
finger<00:00:46.819> there's<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.120> slot<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.809> drum<00:00:48.289> and

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
finger there's a slot in that drum and

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.680 
finger there's a slot in that drum and
there<00:00:49.399> was<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.550> pin<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.120> comes<00:00:50.359> out<00:00:50.539> of<00:00:50.569> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
there was a pin that comes out of that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.610 
there was a pin that comes out of that
fork<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.409> hold<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:53.199> pin<00:00:54.199> was<00:00:54.229> not

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
fork to hold that and that pin was not

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.849 
fork to hold that and that pin was not
in<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:54.979> slot<00:00:55.339> I<00:00:56.350> think<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.589> see<00:00:57.769> it

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
in that slot I think you can see it

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.340 
in that slot I think you can see it
there<00:00:58.569> so<00:00:59.569> when<00:00:59.809> he<00:00:59.870> grabbed<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:00.260> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
there so when he grabbed it and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.399 
there so when he grabbed it and
vertically<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.749> drum<00:01:02.749> was<00:01:02.989> just<00:01:03.170> spinning

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
vertically that drum was just spinning

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.340 
vertically that drum was just spinning
so<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:04.400> never<00:01:04.549> tighten<00:01:04.909> up<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.230> expand<00:01:06.230> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
so we never tighten up to expand the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.310 
so we never tighten up to expand the
brake<00:01:06.530> pads<00:01:06.910> so<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:07.940> take<00:01:08.330> front<00:01:08.570> tire<00:01:08.720> off<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
brake pads so I take front tire off and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.930 
brake pads so I take front tire off and
those<00:01:09.560> little<00:01:09.800> plastic<00:01:09.950> shields<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.670> stuff

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
those little plastic shields and stuff

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.770 
those little plastic shields and stuff
but<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.780> wasn't<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.080> big<00:01:12.260> deal<00:01:12.880> so<00:01:13.880> while<00:01:14.540> he<00:01:14.690> was

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
but it wasn't a big deal so while he was

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.640 
but it wasn't a big deal so while he was
dropping<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.230> off<00:01:16.450> he<00:01:17.450> also<00:01:20.500> he<00:01:21.500> also

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
dropping that off he also he also

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.420 
dropping that off he also he also
dropped<00:01:22.040> off<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.550> little<00:01:22.880> quad<00:01:23.540> again

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
dropped off the little quad again

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.410 
dropped off the little quad again
apparently<00:01:25.430> he<00:01:25.550> went<00:01:25.640> out<00:01:25.820> riding<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.300> and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
apparently he went out riding it and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.850 
apparently he went out riding it and
they<00:01:26.840> wrote<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.080> for<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.350> little<00:01:27.440> while<00:01:27.680> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
they wrote it for a little while and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.370 
they wrote it for a little while and
then<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.010> died<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.600> they<00:01:29.810> could<00:01:29.960> never<00:01:30.080> get<00:01:30.290> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
then it died and they could never get it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.460 
then it died and they could never get it
started<00:01:30.650> again<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.600> don't<00:01:33.050> know<00:01:33.170> I'll<00:01:33.350> have

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.020 
started again so I don't know I'll have
to<00:01:33.590> look<00:01:33.710> into<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.400> let<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:34.820> know<00:01:34.850> what

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I find out ok oh do some research and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.349 
I find out ok oh do some research and
get<00:01:41.510> back<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.810> you

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.270 

alright<00:01:48.359> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.259> his<00:01:49.500> front<00:01:49.710> brake<00:01:49.890> working

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
alright so I got his front brake working

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.200 
alright so I got his front brake working
and<00:01:52.219> readjusted<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.250> where<00:01:53.429> it<00:01:53.520> works<00:01:53.700> cuz<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and readjusted to where it works cuz I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
and readjusted to where it works cuz I
thought<00:01:54.240> I'd<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.600> his<00:01:54.960> back<00:01:55.170> brake<00:01:55.530> because

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
thought I'd just his back brake because

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.169 
thought I'd just his back brake because
it<00:01:55.860> looked<00:01:56.039> wrong<00:01:56.219> when<00:01:56.460> his<00:01:56.549> chain<00:01:56.819> was<00:01:57.030> too

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
it looked wrong when his chain was too

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.469 
it looked wrong when his chain was too
loose<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.530> went<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> loosen<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.819> axle

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
loose and I went to loosen that axle

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.839 
loose and I went to loosen that axle
bolt<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:03.500> look<00:02:04.500> what<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:04.770> did<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:07.700> guess<00:02:08.700> they

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
bolt and look what it did I guess they

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.130 
bolt and look what it did I guess they
just<00:02:08.879> an<00:02:09.179> impact<00:02:09.569> wrench<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.049> that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
just an impact wrench to put that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.009 
just an impact wrench to put that
together<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> factory<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.480> broke<00:02:12.780> my

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
together at the factory and it broke my

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.500 
together at the factory and it broke my
Ridge<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.459> got<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> crash<00:02:14.879> my<00:02:14.910> socket

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
Ridge so I got to crash my socket

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.500 
Ridge so I got to crash my socket

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
funny so that little machine is good to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.770 
funny so that little machine is good to
go<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> turned<00:02:24.930> my<00:02:25.079> attention<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:26.599> his<00:02:27.599> other

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
machine which wouldn't start and the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.830 
machine which wouldn't start and the
first<00:02:32.190> thing<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.459> did<00:02:32.610> was<00:02:32.760> took<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.060> gas<00:02:33.540> line

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
first thing I did was took the gas line

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
first thing I did was took the gas line
off<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.140> carburetor<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.769> made<00:02:34.920> sure<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.250> was

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
off the carburetor and made sure it was

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250 
off the carburetor and made sure it was
getting<00:02:35.579> fuel<00:02:35.880> from<00:02:36.180> both<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.599> main<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
getting fuel from both the main and the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.289 
getting fuel from both the main and the
reserved<00:02:37.620> side<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.130> petcock<00:02:38.519> which<00:02:39.180> it

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
reserved side of the petcock which it

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.140 
reserved side of the petcock which it
was<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:40.040> thought<00:02:41.040> okay<00:02:41.310> well<00:02:41.489> imma<00:02:41.610> check<00:02:41.790> spark

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
was I thought okay well imma check spark

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.509 
was I thought okay well imma check spark
plug<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.660> we're<00:02:42.780> getting<00:02:42.870> spark<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> when

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
plug see if we're getting spark and when

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.660 
plug see if we're getting spark and when
I<00:02:44.549> pulled<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.910> boot<00:02:45.150> off<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.170> was<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.430> spark

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I pulled the boot off it was the spark

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.599 
I pulled the boot off it was the spark
plug<00:02:47.880> was<00:02:48.030> loose<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.889> told<00:02:50.250> him<00:02:50.400> last

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
plug was loose now I I told him last

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.099 
plug was loose now I I told him last
night<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.090> had<00:02:51.239> never<00:02:51.389> even<00:02:51.600> pulled<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
night that I had never even pulled the

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.809 
night that I had never even pulled the
spark<00:02:52.410> plug<00:02:52.650> because<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:53.040> didn't<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
spark plug because I didn't need to it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.090 
spark plug because I didn't need to it
just<00:02:54.030> ran<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.450> good<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.769> know<00:02:55.859> why<00:02:56.069> I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
just ran so good and I don't know why I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.030 
just ran so good and I don't know why I
didn't<00:02:56.459> ever<00:02:56.609> check<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.209> did<00:02:57.389> it<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.040> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
didn't ever check it but I did it and so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
didn't ever check it but I did it and so
his<00:02:59.220> finger<00:02:59.639> loose<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.720> unscrewed<00:03:01.170> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
his finger loose so I just unscrewed it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.870 
his finger loose so I just unscrewed it
with<00:03:01.380> my<00:03:01.470> finger<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.980> pulled<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.459> yep

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
with my finger and pulled it out and yep

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640 
with my finger and pulled it out and yep
sure<00:03:03.090> enough<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.690> dirty<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.109> carbon

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
sure enough it was all dirty and carbon

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.750 
sure enough it was all dirty and carbon
de<00:03:04.769> up<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.010> stuff<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> took<00:03:06.269> my<00:03:06.569> little<00:03:07.760> set

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
de up and stuff so I took my little set

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.629 
de up and stuff so I took my little set
of<00:03:08.790> magic<00:03:09.239> tools<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:10.590> consists<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:13.639> piece

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
of magic tools which consists of a piece

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.330 
of magic tools which consists of a piece
of<00:03:14.670> Emery<00:03:15.060> cloth<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:18.030> points<00:03:18.420> file<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
of Emery cloth and a points file and a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.490 
of Emery cloth and a points file and a
cleaned-up<00:03:20.760> opened<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.450> checked<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.319> gap

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
cleaned-up opened up I checked the gap

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.309 
cleaned-up opened up I checked the gap
it<00:03:22.709> was<00:03:22.799> at<00:03:22.950> 25<00:03:23.370> thousands<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.290> opened

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
it was at 25 thousands and then I opened

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.050 
it was at 25 thousands and then I opened
it<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.010> could<00:03:26.069> file<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:26.910> all

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it up so I could file in there all

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.589 
it up so I could file in there all
around<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.690> electrode<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:29.450> sandpapered<00:03:30.450> it

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
around that electrode and sandpapered it

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.199 
around that electrode and sandpapered it
and<00:03:30.840> then<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.519> got<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:32.700> truck<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.060> see

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
and then you know got a truck and see

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.909 
and then you know got a truck and see
good<00:03:33.419> shiny<00:03:33.720> metal<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> contact

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
good shiny metal on all the contact

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.470 
good shiny metal on all the contact
surfaces<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.459> way<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.639> know<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:36.000> spark

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
surfaces that way you know that spark

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.349 
surfaces that way you know that spark
has<00:03:36.599> got<00:03:36.780> someplace<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.200> go<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.849> more<00:03:39.090> shiny

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
has got someplace to go the more shiny

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.220 
has got someplace to go the more shiny
surfaces<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.049> have<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.970> longer<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.900> spark

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
surfaces you have the longer the spark

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.479 
surfaces you have the longer the spark
plugs<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.680> last<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.980> before<00:03:44.310> need

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
plugs going to last you before need

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.140 
plugs going to last you before need
servicing<00:03:45.739> that's<00:03:46.739> my<00:03:46.980> belief<00:03:47.190> anyway<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.030> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
servicing that's my belief anyway and I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.349 
servicing that's my belief anyway and I
I<00:03:48.540> live<00:03:49.139> by<00:03:49.319> that<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.709> always<00:03:49.859> works<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.250> me<00:03:50.430> so

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
I live by that it always works for me so

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.210 
I live by that it always works for me so
then<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.870> reset<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.229> gap<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.650> put<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.889> back<00:03:53.009> in

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
then I reset the gap and put it back in

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:02.150 
then I reset the gap and put it back in
there<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:55.130> get<00:03:56.130> up<00:03:57.380> fired<00:03:58.380> right<00:03:58.590> up<00:04:01.160> we've

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
there and get up fired right up we've

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.849 
there and get up fired right up we've
made<00:04:02.370> me<00:04:02.489> happy<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:04.290> which<00:04:04.470> case<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.799> will

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
made me happy in which case I will

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:18.930 
made me happy in which case I will
demonstrate

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.130 

the<00:04:19.940> kill<00:04:20.209> switch<00:04:20.450> still<00:04:20.720> doesn't<00:04:20.959> want<00:04:21.020> to

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
the kill switch still doesn't want to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.890 
the kill switch still doesn't want to
work<00:04:21.290> today<00:04:21.970> but<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.000> got<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.300> Deadman<00:04:23.690> switch

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
work today but I got that Deadman switch

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.290 
work today but I got that Deadman switch
on<00:04:24.020> there<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.230> that's<00:04:24.380> working<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.790> I'm<00:04:26.120> sure

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
on there and that's working so I'm sure

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.660 
on there and that's working so I'm sure
he'll<00:04:26.480> be<00:04:26.510> happy<00:04:26.690> about<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.460> was<00:04:28.460> actually

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
he'll be happy about that I was actually

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.790 
he'll be happy about that I was actually
laying<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.840> bed<00:04:29.960> last<00:04:30.200> night<00:04:30.410> thinking<00:04:30.650> about

laying in bed last night thinking about

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.820 
laying in bed last night thinking about
it<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.250> thinking<00:04:31.520> wow<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.450> wonder<00:04:33.380> if<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.710> way

it and thinking wow I wonder if the way
I<00:04:33.860> had<00:04:34.160> cooked<00:04:34.430> up<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:34.790> dead<00:04:34.970> mess<00:04:35.150> which

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
I had cooked up that dead mess which

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.330 
I had cooked up that dead mess which
burned<00:04:35.870> out<00:04:35.990> that<00:04:36.170> coil<00:04:36.500> or<00:04:36.800> did<00:04:36.950> something<00:04:37.190> to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
burned out that coil or did something to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.030 
burned out that coil or did something to
