for<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.019> guess<00:02:33.590> people<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.130> like

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
for like I guess people here like

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.910 
for like I guess people here like
Indonesia<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.120> China<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.019> Tokyo<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:36.799> have

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
Indonesia and China and Tokyo they have

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.400 
Indonesia and China and Tokyo they have
like<00:02:37.069> servants<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:37.910> if<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.870> were<00:02:38.989> my<00:02:39.260> servant

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410

that<00:02:39.860> would<00:02:39.980> be<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.400> guess<00:02:41.030> where<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> sleep

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
that would be I guess where you sleep

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.660 
that would be I guess where you sleep
it's<00:02:42.319> kind<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> good<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:43.040> they<00:02:43.310> says<00:02:43.489> air

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it's kind of good but they says air

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.699 
it's kind of good but they says air
conditioning<00:02:44.060> still<00:02:44.269> here's<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.170> back<00:02:45.350> door

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709

oh<00:02:46.220> no<00:02:47.060> crap<00:02:47.600> that's<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.140> air

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
oh no crap that's just the air

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.199 
oh no crap that's just the air
conditioner<00:02:48.650> out<00:02:48.680> there<00:02:48.920> take<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.910> think<00:02:50.090> see

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
conditioner out there take I think see

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.830 
conditioner out there take I think see
all<00:02:51.049> right<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.769> that's<00:02:51.950> locked<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.690> guess

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
all right so that's locked up so I guess

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.660
