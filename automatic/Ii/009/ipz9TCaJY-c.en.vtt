00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello to this unboxing video service 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.929
 70 was for 77 euros in the offer at the net 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.640
 I do not have the chance today 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.350
 let go so that's also for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.119
 me interesting android device too 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.019
 They have so many other things, yes 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:38.070
 have already tried it here is still 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:40.020
 the film on that we are only off 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.300
 so good from the packaging 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
 I like it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.460
 Now I have to see if that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:54.170
 somewhere else is glued or if 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 I'll just watch it 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 Who does not taped that, I think 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:15.420
 so they sure me 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:23.880
 packed in the film so rausholen 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 yes that looks very easy quite chic 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.890
 so it really is not hard to get in 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.240
 load playbook in hand at 7 inches 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.830
 from the blackberry that came to me pretty much 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.720
 heavy and chunky in front 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.700
 I really like that already 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 So maybe more so maybe there too 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.450
 a small cloth on the tablet is still 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.800
 a protective film over it I have to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 probably only when I'm there 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.970
 would like to work with touch controls 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.060
 Then I have a charger there 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 Immediately into the picture 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 that's exactly what the part will certainly be 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:14.440
 be charged so I'm doing now 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.160
 a little hard to do that off 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.209
 is required dexterity and then 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.890
 I would take a look at these 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.180
 makes so as I said in the first net 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.049
 I had bad luck while the second customer 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.130
 that has only one device although I point 8 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.660
 So there was I was five before 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.680
 eight 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.470
 but the man in front of me has it then 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.829
 but in the other I had net 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.829
 still lucky 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.489
 So far, so I guess too much 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 many copies will live the net 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.459
 not have 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.549
 at the same time make a socket because 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.510
 Actually, it's always like that 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:56.890
 the new equipment must first recharge 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.000
 there you see my last one now grad one 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.069
 do not avoid that, there we see now 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.370
 here 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.709
 that the battery charges ok knows you from 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.160
 other devices also is now first 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.160
 gone away 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.600
 and have to look now 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.340
 Sony is black in the screen 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.360
 moment in europe and were 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.020
 power button is turn on briefly 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.020
 we need this first 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.320
 we have now 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:49.190
 also a usb and mini usb connection that 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.900
 Of course, ok, of course, you have it in 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.990
 the drawers now, after all 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.430
 enough and has can about it 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.870
 Vision is foil is still over it 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.770
 a bit witless at the same time 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:06.440
 but off and then is still a little 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:08.030
 but I do not think that's a hdmi 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.530
 that's kind of a usb 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 extension seemingly where you now 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.080
 once a usb can make 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.100
 no idea whatsoever 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.130
 hdmi is not there now 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.480
 instruction looks very thin that is 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.140
 the whole guide is in different 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.760
 languages â€‹â€‹and how english french so 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.760
 a CD is also not included 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.290
 and yes very extensive is not 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.630
 can of course also speak for that 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.520
 The device is easy to use or 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.570
 Maybe you have to do that too 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.120
 somewhere on the website of 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.680
 Download trekstor I know now 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.640
 at the moment does not say the video should 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.430
 now synonymous only the pure 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.960
 unpacking are the right functions 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.480
 maybe I will again in 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.820
 illuminate afterwards and again 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.470
 I have to look high upload times 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.850
 told me there is not no cd can 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.530
 nothing so manual twice usb 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.230
 cleaning cloth and the tablet itself and 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.100
 a charger now I'll do it 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.900
 here the foil from the ball so me 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.620
 think the song of the design first great 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.169
 so again the playbook has that in 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.890
 the hand of blackberry 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.660
 that's about 500 now 1989 down 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.300
 but we were way too heavy and 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.669
 kind of weird and also fat and that 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.550
 is clearly flatter I believe in the 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:48.760
 Specification is 12 millimeters 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.169
 course a beginner thing but 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.069
 I like it so well I think I have to go there 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:59.379
 press it a bit longer 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:06:02.669
 there is a switch but look there 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.419
 we already see homesickness and an end 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.669
 SD card storage is also available 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.699
 what we for example when google 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.069
 nexus do not all have over 100 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.069
 euro are more expensive than the thing so now 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.389
 i also have an android on it 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.750
 I have never had a smartphone 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.030
 no nix with android was easy now 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.520
 for the price now just for me 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.039
 attractive as I said a bit of luck 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.560
 I had gotten one more there 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.530
 then, apparently, everyone has a net market only 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.970
 to receive a copy 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.159
 Well, so I wonder how many 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.889
 one hundred customers left, 33 is now 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.449
 not it is afternoon now 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.770
 but that's what you have to do then 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.770
 is also set then afterwards when 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.669
 you have connected his wireless connection 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.840
 then you have to activate 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:53.199
 probably press on the lock 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:56.770
 intuitively know how to make a little bit 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.380
 I'm such a kind and yes that's the one 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.250
 start screen 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.469
 my task will it be now 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:08.699
 certainly first after when the 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:10.509
 Battery at 100 percent is then 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.150
 maybe a wireless connection 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.810
 make and then the whole time 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.120
 anzugucken 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.340
 now hopes the battery and there 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.759
 we can see it is bad 10 85 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.979
 percent are now loaded up to 100 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.169
 still needs a bit to 1970 is 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:29.380
 but again I have unfortunately now 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:32.770
 also my smartphone camera from the old one 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:41.919
 palm pre because mine to my other or 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:45.190
 camera is broken so unfortunately 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.940
 that was first then yes, yes 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.419
 next time 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.419
 take care
