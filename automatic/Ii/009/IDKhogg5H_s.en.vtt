with with just calling the dogs and then

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.670 
with with just calling the dogs and then
you're<00:02:25.210> able<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.510> run<00:02:25.900> around<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.260> flank

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
you're able to run around and flank

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.950 
you're able to run around and flank
their<00:02:26.800> spawn<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.280> stuff<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.540> load<00:02:28.690> stars

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
their spawn and stuff but the load stars

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.660 
their spawn and stuff but the load stars
money<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.830> map<00:02:30.040> though<00:02:30.250> because

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
money on this this map though because

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.370 
money on this this map though because
they<00:02:30.970> obviously<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:31.690> spawn<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.260> right

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
they obviously just spawn kind of right

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.110 
they obviously just spawn kind of right
in<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.620> open<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.430> they<00:02:33.610> ended<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.850> shutting

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
in the open and they ended up shutting

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.200 
in the open and they ended up shutting
down<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.570> my<00:02:35.050> lodestar<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:35.980> uh<00:02:36.010> anyway<00:02:36.880> yeah

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
down my my lodestar but uh anyway yeah

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.960 
down my my lodestar but uh anyway yeah
so<00:02:37.240> I<00:02:37.630> think<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.740> gold<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.940> gold

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
so I think that the the gold the gold

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.390 
so I think that the the gold the gold
guns<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.690> black<00:02:41.350> ops<00:02:41.500> 2<00:02:41.620> look<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.100> lot<00:02:42.250> better

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
guns in black ops 2 look a lot better

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.670 
guns in black ops 2 look a lot better
than<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> gold<00:02:42.910> guns<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.300> modern<00:02:44.260> warfare<00:02:44.380> and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
than the gold guns in modern warfare and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.740 
than the gold guns in modern warfare and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.030 
again one which gold guns you like
better<00:02:52.240> black<00:02:52.900> ops<00:02:53.080> 2<00:02:53.380> or<00:02:53.590> modern<00:02:53.800> warfare<00:02:53.920> 3

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
better black ops 2 or modern warfare 3

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.940 
better black ops 2 or modern warfare 3
and<00:02:54.840> yeah<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.870> think<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.470> kind<00:02:56.920> of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
and yeah I think that it's kind of

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.320 
and yeah I think that it's kind of
neither<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.370> get<00:02:57.490> gold<00:02:57.700> second<00:02:58.090> areas

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
neither you can get gold second areas

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.850 
neither you can get gold second areas
and<00:02:58.420> stuff<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.870> think<00:02:59.260> that's<00:02:59.410> kind<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.710> nice

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
and stuff I think that's kind of a nice

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.950 
and stuff I think that's kind of a nice
little<00:03:00.040> treat<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.580> haven't<00:03:01.270> really<00:03:01.390> tried<00:03:01.630> to

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
little treat I haven't really tried to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.240 
little treat I haven't really tried to
get<00:03:02.140> gold<00:03:02.410> secondaries<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.100> don't

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
get gold secondaries because I don't

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.980 
get gold secondaries because I don't
even<00:03:03.400> rock<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> secondary<00:03:04.060> as<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.390> right<00:03:04.540> now<00:03:04.570> so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
even rock a secondary as of right now so

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.380 
even rock a secondary as of right now so
I<00:03:05.260> guess<00:03:06.070> we'll<00:03:06.250> see<00:03:06.370> how<00:03:06.490> it<00:03:06.520> ends<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.270> going

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390
