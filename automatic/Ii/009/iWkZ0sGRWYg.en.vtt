hello<00:00:00.690> youtube<00:00:01.140> today<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> be

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hello youtube today I'm going to be

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.539 
hello youtube today I'm going to be
comparing<00:00:02.520> USB<00:00:03.000> 3<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.720> eSATA<00:00:04.440> SATA<00:00:05.069> however

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
comparing USB 3 to eSATA SATA however

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.519 
comparing USB 3 to eSATA SATA however
you<00:00:05.609> say<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.029> an<00:00:06.120> acronym<00:00:06.390> I'm<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> be

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
you say it's an acronym I'm going to be

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.759 
you say it's an acronym I'm going to be
using<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.890> ocz<00:00:08.700> solid-state<00:00:09.690> drive<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.650> an

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
using a ocz solid-state drive with an

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:21.859 
using a ocz solid-state drive with an
article<00:00:11.040> external<00:00:11.759> enclosure<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:20.750> think<00:00:21.750> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
article external enclosure I think this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.740 
article external enclosure I think this
design<00:00:22.140> works<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:23.150> I've<00:00:24.150> used<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
design works really well I've used a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.150 
design works really well I've used a
couple<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.080> hard<00:00:25.260> drives<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.710> side<00:00:25.890> side

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
couple of hard drives and side side

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.890 
couple of hard drives and side side
drives<00:00:26.460> they've<00:00:26.970> been<00:00:27.090> easy<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.449> switch<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
drives they've been easy to switch and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:45.189 
drives they've been easy to switch and
I've<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.109> had<00:00:28.170> any<00:00:28.320> problems<00:00:28.380> yet

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.889 

so<00:00:45.769> you're<00:00:45.920> going<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.100> need<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.309> USB<00:00:47.120> 3<00:00:47.359> R<00:00:47.510> eSATA

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
so you're going to need a USB 3 R eSATA

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:56.680 
so you're going to need a USB 3 R eSATA
for<00:00:48.199> if<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:48.530> want<00:00:48.679> this<00:00:49.039> high<00:00:49.460> speed<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:56.510> is

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
for if you want this high speed it is

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.479 
for if you want this high speed it is
backwards<00:00:57.170> compatible<00:00:57.229> I'll<00:00:58.129> show<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.370> that

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
backwards compatible I'll show you that

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.340 
backwards compatible I'll show you that
later<00:00:58.550> but<00:00:59.149> this<00:00:59.269> is<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.479> new<00:00:59.719> micro

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
later but this is the new micro

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.609 
later but this is the new micro
connector<00:01:00.890> for<00:01:01.010> USB<00:01:01.430> 3

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
connector for USB 3

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.999 
connector for USB 3
that's<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:03.739> eSATA<00:01:04.190> cable<00:01:06.009> unfortunately

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
that's the eSATA cable unfortunately

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.130 
that's the eSATA cable unfortunately
it's<00:01:07.130> not<00:01:07.250> powered<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.850> do<00:01:08.060> need<00:01:08.360> USB

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's not powered so you do need USB

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.630 
it's not powered so you do need USB
plugged<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.590> as<00:01:09.710> well<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.220> give<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.460> power

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:26.209 

so<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> USB<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.440> test

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.410 

the<00:01:27.219> first<00:01:27.460> test<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.820> going<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:27.969> be<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.149> variety

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
the first test is going to be a variety

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.490 
the first test is going to be a variety
of<00:01:28.719> fails

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
of fails

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.310 
of fails
well<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.009> vowel<00:01:30.130> video<00:01:30.430> files<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:32.170> makes

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
well the vowel video files and it makes

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.260 
well the vowel video files and it makes
it<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.619> comes<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.979> two<00:01:33.130> Higa<00:01:33.369> bytes<00:01:33.579> altogether

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
it it comes to two Higa bytes altogether

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.789 
it it comes to two Higa bytes altogether
and<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.930> second<00:01:35.229> test<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.500> going<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.649> be<00:01:35.740> a

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
and the second test is going to be a

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.460 
and the second test is going to be a
single<00:01:36.250> disk<00:01:36.579> image<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.930> 2<00:01:38.140> pi<00:01:38.289> 3

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
single disk image and that is 2 pi 3

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:49.320 
single disk image and that is 2 pi 3
gigabytes

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.750 

this<00:01:49.990> video<00:01:50.230> hasn't<00:01:50.380> been<00:01:50.680> sped<00:01:51.040> up<00:01:51.070> sundown

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
this video hasn't been sped up sundown

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.820 
this video hasn't been sped up sundown
or<00:01:52.030> anything<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.990> exact<00:01:53.320> footage

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
or anything this is the exact footage

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:03.080 
or anything this is the exact footage
used<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.550> hyper<00:01:54.820> car

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:14.240 

you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.880 

so<00:02:15.250> also<00:02:15.490> gave<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.760> USB<00:02:16.150> -<00:02:16.330> takes<00:02:16.720> 39<00:02:17.260> seconds<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so also gave a USB - takes 39 seconds to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:44.339 
so also gave a USB - takes 39 seconds to
copy<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.280> group<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.610> files

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.500 

one<00:02:44.980> thing<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.340> notice<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.909> a<00:02:45.939> constant

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
one thing to notice it is a constant

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.890 
one thing to notice it is a constant
array<00:02:46.689> of<00:02:47.019> whatever<00:02:47.969> bytes<00:02:48.969> per<00:02:49.180> seconds<00:02:49.599> when

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
array of whatever bytes per seconds when

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.509 
array of whatever bytes per seconds when
I<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.139> test<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> others<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.159> do<00:02:51.310> seem<00:02:51.489> to

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
I do test the others they do seem to

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:02.339 
I do test the others they do seem to
fluctuate<00:02:52.090> quite<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.389> lot<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:02.049> for<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
fluctuate quite a lot so for the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.920 
fluctuate quite a lot so for the
single-file<00:03:02.950> USB<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.909> takes<00:03:04.299> around<00:03:04.689> five

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
single-file USB to takes around five

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.289 
single-file USB to takes around five
four<00:03:05.200> seconds<00:03:05.829> I've<00:03:05.980> counted<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:06.909> from<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
four seconds I've counted that from the

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.149 
four seconds I've counted that from the
frame<00:03:07.569> of<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.079> video<00:03:08.200> where<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.680> start<00:03:09.040> and

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
frame of the video where I start and

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.119 
frame of the video where I start and
start<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:11.230> additional<00:03:11.709> power<00:03:11.829> isn't

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
start the additional power isn't

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.800 
start the additional power isn't
actually<00:03:12.579> needed<00:03:12.969> but<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> purpose<00:03:13.780> of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
actually needed but for the purpose of

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.089 
actually needed but for the purpose of
the<00:03:13.930> video<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:14.439> no<00:03:14.530> one's<00:03:14.709> worried<00:03:14.980> that

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
the video so no one's worried that

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.530 
the video so no one's worried that
there's<00:03:15.280> any<00:03:15.400> cheating<00:03:15.849> going<00:03:15.999> on<00:03:16.180> I'm<00:03:16.389> going

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
there's any cheating going on I'm going

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.830 
there's any cheating going on I'm going
to<00:03:16.629> plug<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.549> straightaway<00:03:21.879> USB<00:03:22.659> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
to plug it in so straightaway USB is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.979 
to plug it in so straightaway USB is
quite<00:03:23.169> a<00:03:23.199> lot<00:03:23.439> faster<00:03:23.949> but<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:24.939> won't<00:03:25.540> get<00:03:25.689> quite

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
quite a lot faster but I won't get quite

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.929 
quite a lot faster but I won't get quite
impressed<00:03:26.439> with<00:03:26.680> how<00:03:26.799> long<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.040> talked<00:03:27.430> it

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
impressed with how long it talked it

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.420 
impressed with how long it talked it
still<00:03:28.239> did<00:03:28.449> take<00:03:28.719> 32<00:03:29.409> seconds<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.069> copy<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
still did take 32 seconds to copy the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.580 
still did take 32 seconds to copy the
group<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:30.760> files<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.419> did<00:03:31.930> expect<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.500> be

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
group of files I did expect it to be

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.250

quite<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> lot<00:03:32.980> quicker<00:03:33.400> than<00:03:33.519> that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
quite a lot quicker than that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.929 
quite a lot quicker than that
considering<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.469> advertised<00:03:36.159> five<00:03:36.579> gigabits

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.670 

for<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.460> single-file<00:03:46.970> usb3<00:03:47.570> was<00:03:47.990> quite<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> lot

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
for the single-file usb3 was quite a lot

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.130 
for the single-file usb3 was quite a lot
faster<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.860> toes<00:03:51.860> all<00:03:52.100> around<00:03:52.370> 15<00:03:53.030> seconds

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.520 

I<00:03:57.200> was<00:03:57.890> impressed<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.280> eSATA<00:03:59.720> suppressed<00:04:00.230> my

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530

I was impressed with eSATA suppressed my
expectations

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.490 

definitely<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.690> quickest<00:04:18.050> for<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.320> group

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
definitely the quickest for the group

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.610 
definitely the quickest for the group

you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.730 

I<00:04:47.660> did<00:04:48.660> think<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.930> would<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.290> quicker<00:04:49.500> but

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
I did think it would do it quicker but

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.000 
I did think it would do it quicker but
it<00:04:49.919> still<00:04:50.100> took<00:04:50.250> 19<00:04:50.850> seconds<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.389> complete<00:04:52.010> us

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
it still took 19 seconds to complete us

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.210 
it still took 19 seconds to complete us
