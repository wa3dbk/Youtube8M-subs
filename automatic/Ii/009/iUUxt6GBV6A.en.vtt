demonstration and these fans have the
silver<00:00:35.760> wiring<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.570> looks<00:00:36.839> nice<00:00:37.080> but

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
silver wiring here which looks nice but

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.500 
silver wiring here which looks nice but
it<00:00:38.220> can<00:00:38.339> make<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.519> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.820> difficult<00:00:39.059> when

it can make it a little difficult when

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
it can make it a little difficult when
removing<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> connector<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.650> regular<00:00:41.460> fans

basically as I did in the on this piece

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.329 
basically as I did in the on this piece
of<00:00:45.600> paper<00:00:45.720> here<00:00:46.699> make<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.729> little<00:00:48.000> diagram<00:00:49.339> with

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
of paper here make a little diagram with

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.939 
of paper here make a little diagram with
your<00:00:50.519> black<00:00:50.940> red<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.210> yellow<00:00:51.420> wires<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.260> then

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
your black red and yellow wires and then

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.030 
your black red and yellow wires and then
do<00:00:53.549> it<00:00:53.670> according<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.619> connector

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
do it according to the way the connector

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.210 
do it according to the way the connector
is<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:58.110> these<00:00:58.229> silver<00:00:58.619> wires<00:00:58.799> I<00:00:59.010> found

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
is but with these silver wires I found

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.770 
is but with these silver wires I found
it<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.369> little<00:00:59.549> more<00:00:59.699> difficult<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.449> basically

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it a little more difficult so basically

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
it a little more difficult so basically
what<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> did<00:01:01.080> was<00:01:01.409> I<00:01:01.500> made<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.920> diagram

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
what I did was I made a little diagram

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
what I did was I made a little diagram
according<00:01:02.909> to<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> part<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
according to the the part that you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
according to the the part that you
remove<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.460> metal<00:01:05.750> things<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
remove here the little metal things that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
remove here the little metal things that
hold<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> pins<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.670> took<00:01:08.729> three

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
hold the pins in and then I took three

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
hold the pins in and then I took three
small<00:01:09.720> pieces<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.110> tape<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.680> number<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.460> each<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
small pieces of tape a number in each of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.779 
small pieces of tape a number in each of
them<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.119> two<00:01:12.150> three<00:01:13.070> according<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.640> way

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
them one two three according to the way

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.120 
them one two three according to the way
I<00:01:14.820> made<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.210> diagram<00:01:15.719> so<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.679> when<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> put<00:01:17.039> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I made my diagram so that when I put it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.870 
I made my diagram so that when I put it
all<00:01:17.189> back<00:01:17.399> together

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
all back together

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
all back together
I<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.240> short<00:01:18.509> anything<00:01:18.719> out<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> all

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
I don't short anything out and it all

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.620 
I don't short anything out and it all
works<00:01:19.770> properly<00:01:20.179> so<00:01:21.179> once<00:01:21.359> you've<00:01:21.509> got

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
works properly so once you've got

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.560 
works properly so once you've got
everything<00:01:22.429> taped<00:01:23.429> off<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.299> got

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
everything taped off here and you got

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
everything taped off here and you got
everything<00:01:24.929> labeled<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.710> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
everything labeled and you get your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.690 
everything labeled and you get your
little<00:01:26.009> diagram<00:01:26.899> you're<00:01:27.899> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.109> do<00:01:28.700> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
little diagram you're going to do is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.280 
little diagram you're going to do is
take<00:01:29.969> your<00:01:30.060> tool

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.720 
take your tool
and<00:01:32.440> you're<00:01:32.950> going<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.100> want<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.310> stick<00:01:33.580> it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
and you're going to want to stick it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.790 
and you're going to want to stick it
inside<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:36.670> holes<00:01:36.940> right<00:01:37.060> here<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.800> when

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
inside these holes right here and when

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.080 
inside these holes right here and when
you<00:01:38.920> look<00:01:39.100> at<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.430> you'll<00:01:39.550> be<00:01:39.670> able<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.940> see

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
you look at it you'll be able to see

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.970 
you look at it you'll be able to see
where<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.270> pins<00:01:40.540> stick<00:01:40.870> up<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.710> stick

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
where the pins stick up you just stick

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.959 
where the pins stick up you just stick
it<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.220> there

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:53.370 

should<00:01:46.570> be<00:01:46.689> able<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.930> wiggle<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.320> wires<00:01:47.530> loose

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.440 

sometimes<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:54.340> takes<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.670> few<00:01:54.850> tries<00:01:54.909> before

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
sometimes it takes a few tries before

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:07.190 
sometimes it takes a few tries before
you<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:55.900> get<00:01:56.080> it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 

there<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.770> go

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
there we go

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.920 
there we go
as<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> see

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
as you can see

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.949 
as you can see
you're<00:02:12.470> left<00:02:12.739> with

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.610 

three

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
three
