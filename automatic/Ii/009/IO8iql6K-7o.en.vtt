timer just a spin cycle and see what
happens<00:00:43.379> obviously<00:00:44.379> it's<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.040> this<00:00:45.160> up<00:00:45.790> here

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
happens obviously it's in this up here

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.640 
happens obviously it's in this up here
at<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.180> spin<00:00:46.480> but<00:00:46.809> don't<00:00:46.930> get<00:00:47.050> any<00:00:47.230> function

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
at the spin but don't get any function

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.380 
at the spin but don't get any function
at<00:00:47.769> all<00:00:47.949> as<00:00:48.339> far<00:00:48.400> as<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.760> educator<00:00:49.300> that

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
at all as far as the educator that

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.049 
at all as far as the educator that
functioning<00:00:50.019> properly<00:00:50.229> the<00:00:50.710> agitator<00:00:51.519> itself

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
functioning properly the agitator itself

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.689 
functioning properly the agitator itself
the<00:00:52.269> upper<00:00:52.479> portion<00:00:52.900> here<00:00:53.140> compared<00:00:53.680> down<00:00:53.920> it

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
the upper portion here compared down it

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.579 
the upper portion here compared down it
should<00:00:55.059> only<00:00:55.210> move<00:00:55.540> in<00:00:55.720> one<00:00:55.870> direction<00:00:55.900> it's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
should only move in one direction it's

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.439 
should only move in one direction it's
kept<00:00:56.890> gears<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.430> prevent<00:00:57.729> it<00:00:57.820> from<00:00:57.850> moving<00:00:58.030> in

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
kept gears to prevent it from moving in

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.719 
kept gears to prevent it from moving in
the<00:00:58.540> opposite<00:00:58.870> direction<00:00:59.019> so<00:00:59.470> we'll<00:01:00.100> go<00:01:00.220> ahead

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
the opposite direction so we'll go ahead

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.219 
the opposite direction so we'll go ahead
obviously<00:01:01.420> we're<00:01:01.570> spinning<00:01:01.960> everything

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
obviously we're spinning everything

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.890 
obviously we're spinning everything
counterclockwise<00:01:03.330> we'll<00:01:04.330> go<00:01:04.449> ahead<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.720> spin

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
counterclockwise we'll go ahead and spin

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.109 
counterclockwise we'll go ahead and spin
it<00:01:04.989> clockwise<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:06.370> spins<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:06.790> way<00:01:06.970> as

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
it clockwise and it spins that way as

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.390 
it clockwise and it spins that way as
well<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:07.600> what<00:01:08.260> happens<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.010> gears<00:01:09.280> that

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
well so what happens is the gears that

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.399 
well so what happens is the gears that
are<00:01:09.580> inside<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:10.690> wear<00:01:10.900> out<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
are inside of here just wear out and

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.490 
are inside of here just wear out and
that<00:01:12.250> prevents<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.119> from<00:01:13.299> functioning<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.409> the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
that prevents it from functioning in the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.210 
that prevents it from functioning in the
proper<00:01:14.710> way

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
proper way

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.789 
proper way
so<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:16.150> fix<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.510> machine<00:01:17.020> today<00:01:17.290> what<00:01:17.650> we'll

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
so to fix this machine today what we'll

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.660 
so to fix this machine today what we'll
need<00:01:17.979> our<00:01:18.159> agitator<00:01:18.610> dogs<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.930> lid<00:01:20.140> switch

when<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.399> go<00:02:03.549> straight<00:02:03.880> down<00:02:04.060> inside<00:02:04.509> this

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
when I go straight down inside this

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.600 
when I go straight down inside this
agitator<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:06.390> try<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.450> loosen<00:02:07.659> this<00:02:07.899> bolt

agitator and try to loosen this bolt
and<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:10.360> spinning<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:11.050> I'm<00:02:11.170> actually<00:02:11.320> going

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and it's spinning so I'm actually going

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.040 
and it's spinning so I'm actually going
to<00:02:11.680> reach<00:02:11.980> into<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.400> water<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:13.210> hold<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.810> base

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
to reach into the water to hold the base

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.050 
to reach into the water to hold the base
once<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.410> boat<00:02:17.770> completely<00:02:18.430> loose

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
once we have that boat completely loose

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660 
once we have that boat completely loose
then<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.900> remove<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.410> agitator<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:21.640> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
then we can remove the agitator now I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.180 
then we can remove the agitator now I
can<00:02:21.880> come<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.270> two<00:02:22.420> different<00:02:22.570> ways

can come out in two different ways

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.320 
can come out in two different ways
sometimes<00:02:24.190> you'll<00:02:24.490> get<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.610> whole<00:02:24.820> agitator

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
sometimes you'll get the whole agitator

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.750 
sometimes you'll get the whole agitator
to<00:02:25.480> come<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.780> other<00:02:26.680> times<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.430> upper

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
to come out other times just this upper

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760 
to come out other times just this upper
portion<00:02:27.940> will<00:02:28.240> come<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.570> either<00:02:29.320> way<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
portion will come out either way it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.650 
portion will come out either way it
doesn't<00:02:29.890> make<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> difference<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.790> we're<00:02:31.630> just

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
to turn this upside down this nut would

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.050 
to turn this upside down this nut would
fall<00:05:05.690> out<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:05.870> my<00:05:05.990> socket<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.639> dogs<00:05:07.879> would

fall out of my socket and the dogs would

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.119 
fall out of my socket and the dogs would
fall<00:05:08.270> out<00:05:08.419> that's<00:05:08.659> no<00:05:08.870> good<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.319> we're<00:05:10.039> going
