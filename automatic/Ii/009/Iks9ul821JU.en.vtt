one day to set the forms this was a

one day to set the forms this was a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
fairly complex building and it took them

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.990 
fairly complex building and it took them
a<00:02:31.319> couple<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.650> days<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.129> get<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.370> done<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.610> lot<00:02:32.879> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
columns and that type of thing so it's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.759 
columns and that type of thing so it's
unusual<00:02:41.849> for<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> take<00:02:43.079> this<00:02:43.260> long<00:02:43.530> but

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
unusual for it to take this long but

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.649 
unusual for it to take this long but
there<00:02:44.519> was<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.909> lot<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> work<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.540> as

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
there was just a lot of work to do as

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.780 
there was just a lot of work to do as
you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.079> columns<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you can see columns there for the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.430 
you can see columns there for the
courtyard<00:02:48.360> trellis<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.959> office<00:02:51.959> patio

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
and then on the backside there's a back

the foreman was out with the plans as

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.670 
the foreman was out with the plans as
you<00:03:11.010> saw<00:03:11.220> previously<00:03:12.680> double-checking

you saw previously double-checking
everybody's<00:03:14.340> work<00:03:14.640> there's<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.390> lot<00:03:15.629> of

everybody's work there's a lot of

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.050 
everybody's work there's a lot of
redundancy<00:03:16.260> involved<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.489> construction

process the surveyors came out and did

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.729 
process the surveyors came out and did
their<00:03:21.239> measurements<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.139> layout<00:03:22.410> crews

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
their measurements then the layout crews

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.629 
their measurements then the layout crews
came<00:03:23.639> out<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.060> double-checked<00:03:24.900> those<00:03:25.639> the

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
came out and double-checked those the

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.699 
came out and double-checked those the
excavators<00:03:27.329> came<00:03:27.599> out<00:03:27.780> dug<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.319> footings

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
excavators came out dug the footings

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.430 
excavators came out dug the footings
then<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.269> forum<00:03:30.660> board<00:03:30.930> guys<00:03:31.139> are

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
then and now the forum board guys are

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.069 
then and now the forum board guys are
here<00:03:31.680> double-checking<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:33.000> placement<00:03:33.930> of

here double-checking the placement of
the<00:03:34.230> footings<00:03:34.590> because<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.609> have<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.000> set

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
the footings because they have to set

and they're going back to the plans and

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.659 
and they're going back to the plans and
if<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.510> footing<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.340> not<00:03:44.340> where<00:03:44.549> it's

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
orange safety caps on all the stakes

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.200 
orange safety caps on all the stakes
and<00:04:26.990> that's<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.259> safety<00:04:29.220> precaution<00:04:29.550> that's

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
and that's a safety precaution that's

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.010 
and that's a safety precaution that's
very<00:04:30.569> good<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.020> do<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> OSHA<00:04:33.180> requirement

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
very good to do it is a OSHA requirement

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.020 
very good to do it is a OSHA requirement
but<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.470> think<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.979> lot<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.220> times<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.180> smaller

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
but I think a lot of times and a smaller

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.820 
but I think a lot of times and a smaller
outfits<00:04:39.030> probably<00:04:39.870> don't<00:04:40.080> do<00:04:40.289> that<00:04:40.500> because

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
outfits probably don't do that because

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.339 
outfits probably don't do that because
it<00:04:40.979> is<00:04:41.099> some<00:04:41.370> additional<00:04:41.789> work<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.960> good<00:04:43.229> to

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
it is some additional work it's good to

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.890 
it is some additional work it's good to
have<00:04:43.560> because<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.310> remember<00:04:45.180> when<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.360> was<00:04:45.599> a<00:04:45.630> kid

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
have because I remember when I was a kid

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.589 
have because I remember when I was a kid
I<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.259> at<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.560> job<00:04:46.800> site<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.539> horsing<00:04:48.539> around

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
I was at the job site a horsing around

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.390 
I was at the job site a horsing around
after<00:04:49.590> after<00:04:50.370> school<00:04:50.729> sometimes<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.740> you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
after after school sometimes and you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.120 
after after school sometimes and you
just<00:04:53.639> don't<00:04:54.569> want<00:04:54.990> somebody<00:04:55.319> to<00:04:55.530> get<00:04:55.710> hurt<00:04:55.949> out

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
just don't want somebody to get hurt out

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.629 
just don't want somebody to get hurt out
there<00:04:57.620> so<00:05:00.800> it's<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.919> good<00:05:02.099> idea<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.460> really

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
there so it's a good idea to really

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.070 
there so it's a good idea to really
follow<00:05:02.940> up<00:05:03.180> with<00:05:03.300> your<00:05:03.419> crews<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:03.840> make<00:05:03.930> sure

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
follow up with your crews and make sure

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.540 
follow up with your crews and make sure
that<00:05:04.259> there<00:05:04.470> are<00:05:04.590> safety<00:05:04.830> conscious<00:05:05.159> like

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
that there are safety conscious like

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.399 
that there are safety conscious like
that<00:05:06.440> CSI<00:05:07.440> also<00:05:07.800> did<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.949> really<00:05:08.250> good<00:05:08.490> cleanup

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409
