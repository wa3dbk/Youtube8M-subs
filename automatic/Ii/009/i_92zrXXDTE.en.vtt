00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello computer friends today sure 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320
 more than once you thought about closing your 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 count of twenty and the truth yes I believe 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 that the time has come to do that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 yes not without first bringing what is yours 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 your photographs can download all 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.439
 our tuenti photos will not take us 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.930
 more than a few minutes for this we 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.620
 we go to google and in the bar 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.100
 searches that we created 20 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.790
 or tuenti as you want and access to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.770
 first of the search results 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
 this is a page of a user 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.870
 particular that has developed this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.220
 tool as you see here before 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.040
 did many more things now simply 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.730
 allows us to download only the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 Photographs 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.550
 What we do is we give you to download 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.780
 for windows in this case 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 we click 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 and start to start the download 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 Here we are only 4.3 megs well 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.030
 that will be pretty fast enough to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 that you see seeing I have here open 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.009
 the tuenti account since we are going to take 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.119
 the photos and here you want to upload 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.409
 some photos 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.210
 we have here these are the photos that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.030
 we are going to download specifically they are going to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.979
 download the photos that we have uploaded and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.369
 the photos in which we are labeled 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.300
 which photos uploaded photos labels 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.800
 I believe that the download has finished 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.840
 Here we go 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 to show all the downloads and 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.409
 we execute the application is called 20 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.619
 points 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.880
 and we execute 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.100
 the interface of a port is a bit 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.789
 Spartan a little aesthetically is not 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.130
 very pretty but good here tells us in 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.990
 what is it we press enter and it asks us 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 the email with which we are 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.700
 blocked in the twente account in 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.700
 this case let's put it 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.200
 in this case our email account 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.950
 press enter and ask us the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.290
 password 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.290
 of the tuenti account 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.000
 and automatically press enter and 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.250
 the download of the photographs begins 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 this process will take more or less time 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.750
 depending on the number of photos and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.710
 images that we have in the account of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.760
 client 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.180
 we say here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.390
 and continue the process to view the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.950
 photos are going to be downloaded in two folders 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.599
 located in it if they will be located in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 the same place let 's stop the file 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.340
 execute in this case 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 I had done it inside the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.680
 part of downloads we go here to 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.530
 downloads and there you have there we have the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.690
 executable and here the two folders of 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 photos where we have been labeled that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.510
 in this case they are only three 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.090
 and the photography that follow 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.769
 downloading that I have uploaded as you see 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.870
 that we have in this case were 45 already 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.420
 we have all the images we can 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.069
 save and use where we want since 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.530
 are already on our hard drive 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.480
 team and this is all that simple 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.439
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.439
 trick until later
