 Hi all 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.380
 In this tutorial I am going to show you how to remove a password in windows 7 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.960
 As you can see, I already have a usb bootable hirens boot version 15.2 connected to my USB port. 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.520
 Well with the connected usb we will restart the computer. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.240
 When the computer restarts, a pantella with various options will emerge 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.020
 Choose the option called mini windows xp with the arrows on your keyboard. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.900
 Choose the HBCD Menu icon on the desktop 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.200
 If the icon does not appear on the desktop follow the next steps 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.800
 Double click on the icon called My Computer. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.700
 Below the category called devices with removable storage 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 Double click on the name of your usb. 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.460
 In my case the usb has the name HBCD 15_2 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.040
 Double-click on the file called HBCDMenu.cmd 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.280
 When the program comes out click on programs. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.780
 Point the mouse where it says password / keys 

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:55.428
 and then point to Windows Login. 

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.843
 At last click on NTPWEDIT 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.380
 The purpose of this program is to modify the file that contains the passwords of your computer. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.140
 As you can see, the unbication of this file is here by default. 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.880
 The only thing we have to do is change the letter of C: to the letter that corresponds to your local disk. 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.900
 With the mouse double click on My Computer 

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:03.176
 Copy the letter on the Local Disk and change the letter C in the program with it 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220
 Click on Reopen 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.860
 Choose the user that you want to remove the password in windows 7 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.380
 Then click on Change Password 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.120
 In New Password type the new password that you want to have in your user. 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.500
 In Verify write the password again 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 Click on OK 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.620
 Give Save Changes 

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.911
 Restart the computer. 

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:43.072
 Choose boot from the hard drive with your cable. 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.580
 As you can see now I have a password with more characters than when I started. 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.502
