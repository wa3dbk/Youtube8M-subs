00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I've just created a really simple setup

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.170 
I've just created a really simple setup
no<00:01:00.500> textures<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.680> materials<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
no textures or materials at all on this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.660 
no textures or materials at all on this
text<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.140> doesn't<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.619> matter<00:01:04.890> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
text and that doesn't really matter so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
text and that doesn't really matter so
we're<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> barbed<00:01:07.229> wire<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we're going to make the barbed wire a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
we're going to make the barbed wire a
little<00:01:07.979> bit<00:01:08.100> smaller<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:09.990> too<00:01:10.170> big

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
little bit smaller so it's not too big

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
little bit smaller so it's not too big
compared<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> text<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> we'll<00:01:11.850> just

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
compared to the text and we'll just

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.960 
compared to the text and we'll just
bring<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> okay<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.909> we

see the s and you want to draw around
where<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.950> want<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> barbed<00:01:53.670> wire<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
where you want the barbed wire to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
where you want the barbed wire to

randomly be and it the barbed wire
actually<00:01:57.119> we'll<00:01:57.479> fix<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> points<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:59.130> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
actually we'll fix on the points I'm you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
actually we'll fix on the points I'm you
see<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> minute<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.329> i'm<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> going

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
see that in a minute but i'm just going

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.480 
see that in a minute but i'm just going
to<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.590> draw<00:02:02.310> roughly<00:02:02.850> round<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.649> texture

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to do draw roughly round the texture

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.889 
to do draw roughly round the texture
because<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> texture<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.450> white<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
because of the texture is white you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.229 
because of the texture is white you
can't<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.320> see<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.030> can

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
can't actually see but I'm you can

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.300 
can't actually see but I'm you can
actually<00:02:09.509> serious<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.590> grey

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.830 

only<00:02:13.520> draw<00:02:13.730> roughly<00:02:14.150> around<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.540> doesn't

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
only draw roughly around it doesn't

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.770 
only draw roughly around it doesn't
matter<00:02:14.989> if<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.319> overlap<00:02:15.739> or<00:02:15.890> anything<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
matter if you overlap or anything and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290 
matter if you overlap or anything and
like<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.050> if<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:19.310> bring<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.819> forward<00:02:20.060> so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
like so if we bring that forward so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.050 
like so if we bring that forward so
click<00:02:20.569> spine<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:22.130> want<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.430> click<00:02:22.640> this

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
now edit all of the little bits and put

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.220 
now edit all of the little bits and put
it<00:02:27.620> into<00:02:27.739> place<00:02:28.010> but<00:02:28.910> while<00:02:29.540> we're<00:02:29.720> moving<00:02:30.110> it

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
it into place but while we're moving it

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.259 
it into place but while we're moving it
in<00:02:30.349> things<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.950> don't<00:02:31.099> actually<00:02:31.310> want<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.060> kind

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
in things we don't actually want we kind

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.790 
in things we don't actually want we kind
of<00:02:32.330> actually<00:02:32.569> do<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.080> after<00:02:33.500> we've<00:02:33.620> done

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.970 
of actually do that after we've done
this<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.550> I'm<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:35.180> we're<00:02:35.390> want<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> put<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
this but I'm well we're want to put the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.770 
this but I'm well we're want to put the
bar<00:02:37.130> while<00:02:37.340> on<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.030> want<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.239> click<00:02:38.450> this

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
button here which kind of makes the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.210 
button here which kind of makes the
object<00:02:41.690> whole<00:02:42.050> again<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:43.010> drag

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
object whole again and if we drag

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.090 
object whole again and if we drag
forward<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.819> can<00:02:44.000> see<00:02:44.300> my<00:02:44.769> rough<00:02:45.769> sketch

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
forward we can see my rough sketch

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.280 
forward we can see my rough sketch
around<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.549> edge<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.780> doesn't<00:02:48.170> actually

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
around the edge and it doesn't actually

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.530 
around the edge and it doesn't actually
matter<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:49.190> bad<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:49.850> you'll<00:02:50.269> see

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
matter that it's bad because you'll see

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.860 
matter that it's bad because you'll see
in<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.720> sec<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.799> just<00:02:51.890> want<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.100> move<00:02:52.489> this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
in a sec so you just want to move this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.800 
in a sec so you just want to move this
roughly<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.549> just<00:02:55.850> coming<00:02:56.150> out<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.660> S

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
roughly so it's just coming out of the S

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.860 
roughly so it's just coming out of the S
like<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.769> looks<00:02:57.920> good<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:59.510> what<00:02:59.750> you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
like so that looks good and now what you

like so that looks good and now what you
want<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.049> do<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.380> click<00:03:00.620> on<00:03:00.769> cloner<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.489> just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
want to do is click on cloner and just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080 
want to do is click on cloner and just
drag<00:03:02.390> spine<00:03:02.840> into<00:03:03.410> object<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.910> can

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
drag spine into object and as you can

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.350 
drag spine into object and as you can
see<00:03:05.120> ads<00:03:05.630> all<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.680> barbed<00:03:07.160> wire<00:03:07.430> onto<00:03:08.030> this

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
see ads all of the barbed wire onto this

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.089 
see ads all of the barbed wire onto this
the<00:03:08.690> size<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.019> were<00:03:09.140> made<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:09.980> you

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
the size that were made it so if you

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.440 
the size that were made it so if you
want<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> make<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.549> smaller<00:03:10.819> which<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.269> do

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
want to make this smaller which we do

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.309 
want to make this smaller which we do
click<00:03:12.049> on<00:03:12.170> barbed<00:03:12.410> wire<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.340> use<00:03:13.549> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
click on barbed wire and just use the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.020 
click on barbed wire and just use the
size<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.620> land<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.220> drag<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.549> down<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.970> about

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
size to land just drag it down to about

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.800 
size to land just drag it down to about
that<00:03:17.720> size<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:19.060> clicking<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.150> Chlo<00:03:20.540> know<00:03:20.750> you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that size and clicking on Chlo know you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020 
that size and clicking on Chlo know you
want<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> go<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.200> count<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.000> see

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
want to go to count and as you can see

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.960 
want to go to count and as you can see
more<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.660> put<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.320> more<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.859> come<00:03:25.190> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
more we put on the more that come so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.479 
more we put on the more that come so
that<00:03:26.329> looks<00:03:26.420> pretty<00:03:26.570> good<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:28.070> as<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.340> can

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
that looks pretty good and as you can

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.509 
that looks pretty good and as you can
see<00:03:28.519> as<00:03:28.790> well<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.239> lot<00:03:29.900> around<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.739> edges<00:03:31.130> and

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
see as well a lot around the edges and

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.039 
see as well a lot around the edges and
that's<00:03:31.910> because<00:03:32.090> there<00:03:32.359> are<00:03:32.450> more<00:03:32.480> points

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
that's because there are more points

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.330 
that's because there are more points
around<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.319> edges<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.799> on<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.040> straights

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
around the edges and on the straights

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.550 
around the edges and on the straights
there<00:03:34.609> are<00:03:34.700> less<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.600> if<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.720> got<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.959> spine<00:03:36.380> in

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
there are less so if we got a spine in

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.130 
there are less so if we got a spine in
the<00:03:36.769> third<00:03:37.190> one<00:03:37.370> down<00:03:37.549> here<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:38.359> can<00:03:38.540> see<00:03:38.720> love

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140
