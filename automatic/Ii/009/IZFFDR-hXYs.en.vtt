00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920

he's<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.310> ghost<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:15.940> can't<00:03:16.120> actually<00:03:16.239> touch

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
more and makes him even angrier and thus

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.350 
more and makes him even angrier and thus
