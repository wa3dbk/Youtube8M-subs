let me talk about the pot the pop on the
sport<00:01:53.330> if<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:53.630> take<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> look<00:01:54.440> at<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.650> concave

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
sport if you take a look at the concave

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.680 
sport if you take a look at the concave
stick<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.020> look<00:01:57.170> at<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.440> concave<00:01:57.979> the

stick it to look at the concave the
concave<00:01:59.690> isn't<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.290> deep<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.280> as<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.580> thought

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
concave isn't as deep and as I thought

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
concave isn't as deep and as I thought
it<00:02:01.970> would<00:02:02.000> be<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.759> way<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.270> board<00:02:05.570> is

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it would be but the way the board is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.889 
it would be but the way the board is
made<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:07.009> kind<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.310> wood<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.759> although<00:02:08.300> most

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
made what kind of wood is although most

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.170 
made what kind of wood is although most
for<00:02:09.110> jamaica<00:02:09.410> canadian<00:02:09.860> maple<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:11.000> is
