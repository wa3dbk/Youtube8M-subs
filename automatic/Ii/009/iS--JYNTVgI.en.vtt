started<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.090> pretty<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.379> thumbnail

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
started out pretty much as a thumbnail

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.810 
started out pretty much as a thumbnail
sketch<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> took<00:00:50.969> them<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
sketch and I took them all the way to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.750 
sketch and I took them all the way to
finish<00:00:53.820> level<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> sketch<00:00:54.750> rendering<00:00:55.760> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
finish level of a sketch rendering so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
finish level of a sketch rendering so
I'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.120> through<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.510> images<00:00:57.899> just

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
all these final pieces and it can create

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.080 
all these final pieces and it can create
several<00:01:06.570> different<00:01:06.689> looks<00:01:07.970> but<00:01:08.970> I've

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
several different looks but I've

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.710 
several different looks but I've
designed<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> video<00:01:10.439> game<00:01:10.770> toy

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the different tools I use in my in the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
the different tools I use in my in the
steps<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.189> creating<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.700> final<00:01:30.030> piece<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:31.350> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
steps of creating a final piece this is

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
steps of creating a final piece this is
an<00:01:31.680> initial<00:01:32.479> thumbnail<00:01:33.479> page<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.610> use

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
an initial thumbnail page and I just use

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.719 
an initial thumbnail page and I just use
the<00:01:36.390> simple<00:01:36.630> pencils<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.290> come<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the simple pencils that come with the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.050 
the simple pencils that come with the
program<00:01:38.939> itself<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:41.070> change<00:01:41.340> sizes

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
program itself and I might change sizes

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.100 
program itself and I might change sizes
and<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.369> take<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> thumbnail<00:01:45.540> sketch

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and then I take that thumbnail sketch

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
and then I take that thumbnail sketch
into<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.460> final<00:01:47.850> sketch<00:01:48.149> where<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> blow

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
into more of a final sketch where I blow

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.670 
into more of a final sketch where I blow
it<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> draw<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.460> rough<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.680> clean

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it up and draw it really rough and clean

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.170 
it up and draw it really rough and clean
up<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> line<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> make<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> look

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
up all the line work and make it look

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.899 
up all the line work and make it look
more<00:01:54.360> refined<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
more refined and as you can see here I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
more refined and as you can see here I
have<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.180> ghosted<00:01:57.689> image<00:01:57.960> behind<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> then

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
have a ghosted image behind it and then

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.940 
have a ghosted image behind it and then
I<00:01:59.219> start<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.259> ghosted<00:02:01.259> image<00:02:01.590> as

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
I start to go over the ghosted image as

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
I start to go over the ghosted image as
if<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.520> using<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.090> piece<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> tracing<00:02:03.899> paper<00:02:04.079> or
