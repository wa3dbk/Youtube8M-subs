anything<00:00:54.520> else

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
anything else

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.240 
anything else
oh<00:00:55.090> yeah<00:00:55.629> tell<00:00:56.500> us<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.620> little<00:00:56.710> bit<00:00:56.860> about<00:00:56.950> the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
oh yeah tell us a little bit about the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.090 
oh yeah tell us a little bit about the
tried<00:00:58.150> ghouls<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.840> guess<00:00:59.020> you<00:00:59.170> can<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.680> for<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
tried ghouls I guess you can go for the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.330 
tried ghouls I guess you can go for the
dual<00:01:00.309> channel<00:01:01.270> memory<00:01:01.390> and<00:01:01.870> but<00:01:02.680> everyone<00:01:03.250> is

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
dual channel memory and but everyone is

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.340 
dual channel memory and but everyone is
talking<00:01:03.520> about<00:01:03.670> 204<00:01:04.239> but<00:01:04.629> most<00:01:04.869> important

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
talking about 204 but most important

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
talking about 204 but most important
thing<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:06.010> have<00:01:07.050> sufficient<00:01:08.050> memory

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
thing is to have sufficient memory

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.590 
thing is to have sufficient memory
channel<00:01:09.670> support

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
channel support

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.700 
channel support
so<00:01:12.200> Optimus<00:01:13.159> 3d<00:01:13.300> not<00:01:14.300> only<00:01:14.600> has<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.810> app<00:01:15.110> or<00:01:15.409> it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
so Optimus 3d not only has to app or it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.870 
so Optimus 3d not only has to app or it
also<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.130> dual<00:01:16.430> memory

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.640 

each<00:01:20.180> memory<00:01:20.630> can<00:01:20.840> be<00:01:21.020> mixed<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.410> matched

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
each memory can be mixed and matched

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.540 
each memory can be mixed and matched
with<00:01:22.360> World<00:01:23.360> War<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.530> processing<00:01:25.190> now<00:01:25.400> in

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
with World War that is processing now in

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.640 
with World War that is processing now in
this<00:01:25.610> case<00:01:25.790> we're<00:01:25.970> talking<00:01:26.090> about<00:01:26.300> ddr2<00:01:27.110> ram

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
this case we're talking about ddr2 ram

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.860 
this case we're talking about ddr2 ram
up<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.160> internal<00:01:28.610> storage<00:01:28.640> space<00:01:29.060> right<00:01:29.180> we're

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
up to internal storage space right we're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.120 
up to internal storage space right we're
talking<00:01:30.170> about<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.440> EDR<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.070> ram<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.270> has<00:01:33.050> a

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
talking about the EDR to ram it has a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.950 
talking about the EDR to ram it has a
64-bit<00:01:34.130> access<00:01:34.550> channel<00:01:34.940> as<00:01:35.300> opposed<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
64-bit access channel as opposed to the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.880 
64-bit access channel as opposed to the
regular<00:01:36.110> 32-bit<00:01:37.010> okay<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.850> any<00:01:38.060> other<00:01:38.890> so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
regular 32-bit okay and on any other so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.530 
regular 32-bit okay and on any other so
therefore<00:01:40.250> both<00:01:40.460> course<00:01:40.820> can<00:01:41.030> be<00:01:41.060> accessing

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
therefore both course can be accessing

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.980 
therefore both course can be accessing
the<00:01:41.600> memory<00:01:41.780> factory<00:01:42.410> also<00:01:43.340> 1/4<00:01:44.270> can<00:01:44.630> access

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the memory factory also 1/4 can access

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.750 
the memory factory also 1/4 can access
to<00:01:45.260> memories<00:01:45.620> at<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.830> same<00:01:46.040> time<00:01:46.280> because<00:01:46.490> it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
to memories at the same time because it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.500 
to memories at the same time because it
can<00:01:46.880> issue<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.180> 64-bit<00:01:47.870> access<00:01:48.260> which<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:50.390> are

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
can issue a 64-bit access which we are

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.960 
can issue a 64-bit access which we are
running<00:01:50.750> low<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:50.960> battery<00:01:51.380> though<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:52.880> is

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
running low on battery though so this is

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.690 
running low on battery though so this is
a<00:01:53.060> magic<00:01:53.390> screen<00:01:53.720> there<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> 3d<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.280> hardware

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
a magic screen there is a 3d of hardware

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.380 
a magic screen there is a 3d of hardware
here<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.720> call<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.140> 3<00:01:57.610> if<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.640> long<00:01:58.940> press<00:01:58.970> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
here we call it a 3 if you long press it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.700 
here we call it a 3 if you long press it
for<00:01:59.540> one<00:01:59.750> second<00:02:00.290> it'll<00:02:00.950> jump<00:02:01.220> into<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.610> DUI

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
for one second it'll jump into this DUI

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.040 
for one second it'll jump into this DUI
first<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.890> got<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.070> 3d<00:02:04.430> guide<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:05.930> you've

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
first you got a 3d guide and then you've

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.370 
first you got a 3d guide and then you've
got<00:02:06.200> 3d<00:02:06.770> games<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.340> apps
