gouge so they backed into something and
so<00:02:04.680> that's<00:02:04.860> they're<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.520> okay<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> got

so that's they're just okay well I got

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.639 
so that's they're just okay well I got
to<00:02:06.450> jump<00:02:06.689> back<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> little<00:02:07.140> bit<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.469> other

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to jump back a little bit one other

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.680 
to jump back a little bit one other
issue<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.099> forgot<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> point<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
issue I forgot to point out is there's a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.820 
issue I forgot to point out is there's a
crack<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> sidewall<00:02:10.800> here

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
crack in the sidewall here

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.710 
crack in the sidewall here
one<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> mistakes<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.420> think

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
one of the mistakes that I think

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.150 
one of the mistakes that I think
Gulfstream<00:02:15.170> makes<00:02:15.380> when<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.710> when<00:02:16.070> they

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
Gulfstream makes when they when they

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640 
Gulfstream makes when they when they
manufacture<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.390> making<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.080> solid

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
manufacture this is making this a solid

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.740 
manufacture this is making this a solid
piece<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.580> fact<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.000> can<00:02:20.210> see<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.690> was

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
piece and in fact I can see that it was

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
piece and in fact I can see that it was
repaired<00:02:21.260> from<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> factory<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.340> then

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
repaired from the factory and then

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.720 
repaired from the factory and then
painted<00:02:23.960> over<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.440> then<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.100> cracked<00:02:25.340> again

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
painted over and then it cracked again

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.610 
painted over and then it cracked again
and<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:25.970> wreak<00:02:26.180> acht<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> modern-day

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and they wreak acht it on a modern-day

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.260 
and they wreak acht it on a modern-day
coach<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.400> they<00:02:28.760> would<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.030> build

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
coach like this they would just build

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.420 
coach like this they would just build
this<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> seam<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.070> would<00:02:31.160> just<00:02:31.310> be

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
this with a seam and so it would just be

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.160 
this with a seam and so it would just be
two<00:02:31.610> pieces<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.060> fiberglass<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.960> could

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
two pieces of fiberglass so it could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.650 
two pieces of fiberglass so it could
flex<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.370> would<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.850> consider<00:02:35.210> this<00:02:35.450> an

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
flex so I would not consider this an

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.450 
flex so I would not consider this an
issue<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.170> fiberglass<00:02:36.920> says<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.220> mean

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
issue and fiberglass says I mean

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.940 
issue and fiberglass says I mean
Gulfstream<00:02:38.450> has<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> very<00:02:39.140> good<00:02:39.410> rating<00:02:39.800> on

laminated<00:02:43.100> wall<00:02:43.310> all<00:02:44.210> right<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.480> let's<00:02:44.630> just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
laminated wall all right so let's just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.010 
laminated wall all right so let's just
continue<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:46.240> okay<00:02:47.240> on<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> other<00:02:47.660> side
