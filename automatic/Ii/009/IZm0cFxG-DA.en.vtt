the Billy not much different than seer

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:45.970 
the Billy not much different than seer
now<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.100> terms<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.460> difficulty<00:04:31.850> I<00:04:44.890> think<00:04:45.890> what

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
now in terms of difficulty I think what

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.530 
now in terms of difficulty I think what
I'll<00:04:46.040> do<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.340> I'll<00:04:46.430> stop<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.970> recording<00:04:47.090> and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
I'll do is I'll stop the recording and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.360 
I'll do is I'll stop the recording and
then<00:04:47.660> start<00:04:47.900> another<00:04:48.140> one<00:04:48.350> after<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:49.010> level

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
then start another one after this level

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.220 
then start another one after this level
because<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.360> should<00:04:50.630> be<00:04:50.780> about<00:04:50.870> 10<00:04:51.200> minutes

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
because that should be about 10 minutes

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.100 
because that should be about 10 minutes
well<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.370> might<00:04:52.580> actually<00:04:52.760> be<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.390> lot<00:04:54.080> shorter

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
well it might actually be a lot shorter

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.630 
well it might actually be a lot shorter
than<00:04:54.530> 10<00:04:54.710> minutes<00:04:54.890> but<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.960> think<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.200> pers<00:04:57.640> good

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
than 10 minutes but I think to pers good

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:08.839 
than 10 minutes but I think to pers good
idea

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:16.019
