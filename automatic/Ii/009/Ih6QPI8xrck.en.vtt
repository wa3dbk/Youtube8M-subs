00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
right now it seems like top laners are

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
right now it seems like top laners are
playing<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:02.729> much<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> mindset<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> as

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
playing very much of the mindset that as

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
playing very much of the mindset that as
long<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> avoid<00:02:05.009> ganks<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.939> it's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
long as they can avoid ganks that it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.670 
long as they can avoid ganks that it's
good<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.540> push<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> lane<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.229> maintain

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
about shoving in so because you had the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.820 
about shoving in so because you had the
creeps<00:03:06.959> all<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.170> way<00:03:07.260> over<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.650> could

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
creeps all the way over there you could

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.670 
creeps all the way over there you could
roam<00:03:08.070> without<00:03:08.190> necessarily<00:03:08.520> losing<00:03:09.209> too<00:03:09.330> much

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

carcass<00:03:14.130> at<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> turret<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.600> i<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:16.110> just<00:03:16.320> look

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
carcass at the turret so i can just look

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.320 
carcass at the turret so i can just look
around<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.070> see<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:17.519> i<00:03:17.550> can<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.790> they're

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
roaming ok is this typically how you

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.860 
roaming ok is this typically how you
find<00:03:20.760> yourself<00:03:21.090> playing<00:03:21.180> rumble<00:03:21.630> just
