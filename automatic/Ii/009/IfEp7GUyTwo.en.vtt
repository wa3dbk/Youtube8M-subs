00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.980
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.960
 first wanted warcraft tutorial today 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.630
 I'll show you how to do that 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.700
 probing and herbs are easier to paint 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.699
 makes that easy is her user 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.800
 for only a small marco 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.080
 krauth travel could you have the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.540
 plant or other then enter / 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.519
 probe can explore their approach 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.410
 indulge in painting and hughes that again 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.900
 what's up here waiting to travel 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.629
 told my case so if you have 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.399
 you that in one strip you click 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.170
 one time spent probing her drive 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.230
 The swiss and her are allowed to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.989
 gets the items normally 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 if you did that then you have in 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 Your marco finished if you still have that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.500
 then robbers are needed to make it easier 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.710
 the one keyboard or contains one 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.789
 keyboard the markus allows with what one 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.590
 markus abt think 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.550
 It's easy then you go 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.750
 just this is what this marco occupies 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:17.150
 with a new macro or enter 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.800
 probing or for the first time now 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.570
 Recording data 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.570
 after simply times the once purely 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.719
 also to burn okay now only 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.090
 Repeat option not thought at 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.009
 the key 1 off so always so if you 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.679
 that really wanted to do like to go 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:44.310
 then you turn it off so now I have 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:47.049
 Save it to the three occupied profile 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.890
 flow and now I press my g3 times 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:55.450
 and yes it will be cast by so 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.299
 Do her other things and one now 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.750
 emergency brake and that does it all 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.810
 for you 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.720
 Thank you for watching 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 Have a nice day and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.720
