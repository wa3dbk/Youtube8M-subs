00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
would call it non e or AC 701 variation

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.540

the<00:00:34.230> AC<00:00:34.410> 701<00:00:35.250> tube<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.820> soldered<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.550> very

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the AC 701 tube is soldered in and very

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.959 
the AC 701 tube is soldered in and very
very<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.960> quiet<00:00:40.379> tube<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:41.910> were

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
very good very quiet tube and they were

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
very good very quiet tube and they were
all<00:00:42.149> made<00:00:42.390> by<00:00:42.540> Telefunken<00:00:43.230> therefore<00:00:43.620> they're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
all made by Telefunken therefore they're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
all made by Telefunken therefore they're
very<00:00:44.070> consistent<00:00:45.260> 60<00:00:46.260> 72<00:00:46.829> s<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.219> E<00:00:47.460> CCAT<00:00:48.030> ones

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.470 
very consistent 60 72 s and E CCAT ones
were<00:00:48.629> made<00:00:48.809> by<00:00:49.020> everybody<00:00:49.670> Under<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> Sun<00:00:51.030> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.479 
sounds has a very nice sweet top-end but
there's<00:03:52.170> also<00:03:52.349> a<00:03:52.530> portion<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> mid-range

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
there's also a portion of the mid-range

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.050 
there's also a portion of the mid-range
that's<00:03:53.790> very<00:03:54.030> very<00:03:54.510> sweet<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.260> aggressive<00:03:56.060> as

that's very very sweet and aggressive as

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.090 
that's very very sweet and aggressive as

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
I move to the c12 you'll notice that

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.150 
I move to the c12 you'll notice that
there's<00:04:03.319> there's<00:04:04.319> less<00:04:04.680> low<00:04:05.519> end<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
there's there's less low end and the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.309 
there's there's less low end and the
mid-range<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.459> more<00:04:09.000> pronounced<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:10.049> my

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
mid-range is more pronounced with my

mid-range is more pronounced with my
voice<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.700> way<00:04:11.819> my<00:04:11.970> voice

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000

sounds<00:04:12.660> mic<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.260> more<00:04:13.880> more<00:04:14.880> natural<00:04:15.599> more

that they are similar in tone but

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.500 
that they are similar in tone but

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the 251 e that is due to the difference

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.480 
the 251 e that is due to the difference
in<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.050> mesh<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.890> difference<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.400> the

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
head grille the vacuum tube is also

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.180 
head grille the vacuum tube is also
inverted<00:04:46.440> inside<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.900> 251<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.710> cut<00:04:50.039> the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
inverted inside the 251 to cut the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.050 
inverted inside the 251 to cut the

tube<00:04:54.270> leads<00:04:54.630> which<00:04:55.110> actually<00:04:55.620> increases<00:04:56.370> the

tube leads which actually increases the

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.500 
tube leads which actually increases the
excuse<00:04:57.479> me<00:04:57.630> reduces<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.410> self<00:04:58.919> noise<00:04:59.510> so

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
excuse me reduces the self noise so

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.020 
excuse me reduces the self noise so
we'll<00:05:00.630> move<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.820> 251<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:04.820> you'll<00:05:05.820> see

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
we'll move to the 251 and you'll see

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.390 
we'll move to the 251 and you'll see
that<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.389> has<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:06.600> very<00:05:06.900> similar<00:05:07.470> quality<00:05:08.160> to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
that it has a very similar quality to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.810 
that it has a very similar quality to
the<00:05:08.520> 251<00:05:09.240> II<00:05:10.010> because<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.220> particular<00:05:11.370> he

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
the 251 II because this particular he

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.320 
the 251 II because this particular he
has<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.120> very<00:05:12.389> good<00:05:12.479> vacuum<00:05:13.320> tube<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.490> so

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
has a very good vacuum tube in it and so

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.460 
has a very good vacuum tube in it and so
you<00:05:15.419> don't<00:05:15.539> see<00:05:15.660> a<00:05:15.780> lot<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.110> difference

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
you don't see a lot of difference

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.339 
you don't see a lot of difference
between<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.889> two<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:18.419> two<00:05:18.660> tubes<00:05:20.270> the

between the two the two tubes the

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.450 
between the two the two tubes the
251<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.759> 251<00:05:24.759> e<00:05:25.150> are<00:05:26.050> known<00:05:26.470> not<00:05:26.830> just<00:05:26.860> for

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
251 and 251 e are known not just for

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.080 
251 and 251 e are known not just for
their<00:05:27.669> overall<00:05:28.210> sound<00:05:28.990> quality<00:05:29.199> and<00:05:29.910> how<00:05:30.910> they

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
their overall sound quality and how they

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.129 
their overall sound quality and how they
adapt<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:32.160> almost<00:05:33.160> any<00:05:33.639> source<00:05:34.360> material<00:05:34.960> but

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
adapt to almost any source material but

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.400 
adapt to almost any source material but
also<00:05:35.830> how<00:05:36.160> they<00:05:36.340> sit<00:05:36.729> in<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.509> mix<00:05:37.810> they

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
also how they sit in the mix they

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.930 
also how they sit in the mix they
