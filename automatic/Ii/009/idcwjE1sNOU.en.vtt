 we have here a very beautiful skin we are going 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.469
 to say to fat tendency 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.000
 it remains a mixed skin with a tendency 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 fat why because actually 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.460
 normal and thick oily skin

 that lydia had to do some care 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.859
 say the astringent effect lydia 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.620
 presents task tasks due to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.480
 comedones she had previously 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 so who have been treated we can 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.970
 also note that the complexion remains 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 earth at the level of the ovals of the face 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.990

 zone t features of the skin 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 grasse we will still appeal to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.060
 term nature for its virtues 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 we used from there coffee grounds 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 coffee that you drink every morning by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.900
 example mixed with honey in order to make 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.310
 a scrub still natural we 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.720

 to dry the buttons well 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.460
 heard all these tricks all these 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.310
