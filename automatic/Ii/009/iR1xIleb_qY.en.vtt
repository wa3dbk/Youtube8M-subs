making sure and you guys kept I can't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.350 
making sure and you guys kept I can't
see<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> reflection<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.470> says<00:01:04.619> avoid<00:01:04.920> so

see but a reflection there says avoid so
my<00:01:06.360> guess<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.200> ripped<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:09.210> not

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
my guess is if it's ripped it's not

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
my guess is if it's ripped it's not
going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.750> working<00:01:13.280> yeah<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> doesn't
