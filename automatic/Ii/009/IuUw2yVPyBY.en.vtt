there but you would walk right up these
stairs<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.489> left<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.329> would<00:01:00.480> have

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stairs and to your left you would have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
stairs and to your left you would have
the<00:01:01.410> wall<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> defended<00:01:02.699> them<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.149> quite<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the wall that defended them for quite a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
the wall that defended them for quite a
while<00:01:03.510> until<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.140> blowing<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.769> by<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.000> uh

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
while until it was blowing up by and uh

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.160 
while until it was blowing up by and uh
pretty<00:01:06.869> much<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> kamikaze<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:08.130> acai<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.170> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pretty much a kamikaze or acai and this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
pretty much a kamikaze or acai and this
is<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> great<00:01:10.560> i<00:01:10.590> built<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.220> drains<00:01:11.549> off

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is the great i built and just drains off

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
is the great i built and just drains off
over<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.150> doesn't<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.840> any<00:01:12.990> real

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
over there doesn't really have any real

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.330 
over there doesn't really have any real
place<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.280> drains<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.920> kind<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
place where drains and then you kind of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.310 
place where drains and then you kind of
get<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> inner<00:01:17.850> keep<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> probably

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
get to the inner keep which is probably

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
get to the inner keep which is probably
one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> cooler<00:01:20.070> things<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.549> hard<00:01:20.700> athens

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
one of the cooler things and hard athens

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
one of the cooler things and hard athens
to<00:01:21.090> build<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.420> had<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> say<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> three

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to build i had to say you have the three

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.380 
to build i had to say you have the three
doors<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:23.939> i<00:01:23.970> could<00:01:24.090> replicate

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
doors the only thing i could replicate

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560 
doors the only thing i could replicate
was<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> top<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> windows<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
was the top with the windows but you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
was the top with the windows but you
know<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.500> build<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> i

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
know this is like my first build so i

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
know this is like my first build so i
will<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.430> better<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.570> noticed<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
will get better and i noticed in the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
will get better and i noticed in the
movie<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.619> picture<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.159> least<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
movie or the picture at least that you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
movie or the picture at least that you
they<00:01:33.299> only<00:01:33.450> had<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.840> walkway<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.829> i

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
they only had one walkway up here so i

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
they only had one walkway up here so i
guess<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.250> why<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.240> powerful

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
guess that's why it was so powerful

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
guess that's why it was so powerful
because<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.650> walk<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.130> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
because there's only one way walk in so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
because there's only one way walk in so
even<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.000> you've<00:01:39.119> broken<00:01:39.329> their<00:01:39.630> you'd<00:01:39.900> be

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
even if you've broken their you'd be

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.980 
even if you've broken their you'd be
shot<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.829> down<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:42.960> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
shot out from down there you would have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
shot out from down there you would have
that<00:01:43.409> door<00:01:43.680> closed<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.520> have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that door closed on you and you have

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.920 
that door closed on you and you have
people<00:01:44.820> shooting<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.899> like

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
people shooting so it would just be like

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.190 
people shooting so it would just be like
a<00:01:46.049> clusterfuck<00:01:46.649> almost<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.570> walk

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a clusterfuck almost and then you walk

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
a clusterfuck almost and then you walk
in<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.460> all<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> way<00:01:50.700> around

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
in here and you go all the way around

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.319 
in here and you go all the way around
and<00:01:51.649> here's<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> tower<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.430> Gimli<00:01:54.299> blew

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and here's the tower which Gimli blew

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.350 
and here's the tower which Gimli blew
the<00:01:54.869> horn<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> last<00:01:55.740> time<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.360> called

ham<00:02:02.460> people<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
ham people I think I I don't know it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.990 
ham people I think I I don't know it's
been<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> year<00:02:05.219> since<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.670> watched<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
been like a year since I watched the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
been like a year since I watched the
movie<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.750> pretty<00:02:06.990> badass<00:02:07.170> though<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.799> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
movie so pretty badass though and this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.820 
movie so pretty badass though and this
is<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> table<00:02:09.030> at<00:02:09.270> which<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
is the table at which you know they I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
is the table at which you know they I
remember<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.340> had<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> few<00:02:11.640> tables<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.239> I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
remember they had a few tables in here I

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.750 
remember they had a few tables in here I
think<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> was

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
think it was

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.970 
think it was
be<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.879> little<00:02:12.939> bit<00:02:13.120> bigger<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:14.170> still<00:02:14.590> pretty

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
be a little bit bigger but still pretty

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.089 
be a little bit bigger but still pretty
good<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.750> last<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.439> least<00:02:17.500> is

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
good and then the last but not least is

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.910 
good and then the last but not least is
the<00:02:18.659> cave<00:02:19.659> system<00:02:20.110> didn't<00:02:20.409> really<00:02:20.560> work<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.769> lot

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
the cave system didn't really work a lot

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190 
the cave system didn't really work a lot
on<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.480> does<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.780> job<00:02:22.989> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
on this but it kind of does the job and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.800 
on this but it kind of does the job and
it<00:02:23.950> even<00:02:24.099> has<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.370> little<00:02:24.670> bit<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.849> an<00:02:25.000> exit<00:02:25.360> out

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
it even has a little bit of an exit out

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.229 
it even has a little bit of an exit out
