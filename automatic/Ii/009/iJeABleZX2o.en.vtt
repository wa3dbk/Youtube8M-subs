00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:11.900
 you hear the new diesel v8 in porsche

 Motor for best efficiency if possible 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.529
 athletic performance is demonstrated 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.090
 the new cayenne s diesel maximum 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.880
 sportiness at the highest possible 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.830
 Outwardly, efficiency is different 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:45.770
 the new in the diesel program hardly of 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:47.899
 his brothers that it is the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.320
 eat diesel version trades betrays the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:56.570
 small lettering on the side at 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.449
 look under the sheet dress shows up 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.449
 the new 4 2 liter biturbo v8 engine 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 he outperforms the v6 diesel clearly 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.220
 performance as msc of his power of 283 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 km and turns of 815 newton meters 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 is an eight-cylinder diesel and two 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.690
 six cylinder diesel an achievement of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.490
 180 km of bike and 550 newton meters 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.770
 that means it is much higher 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.050
 positioned as the base model v6 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.640

 But there are also similarities 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.960
 to be switched to the smaller brother 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.360
 both via an eight-speed tiptronic s 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.410
 automatic and both have 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.050
 start-stop function as standard on board 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.960
 It helps to save fuel so that the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.729
 Cayenne's crisis averaged only 8.3 liters 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.039
 on 100 kilometers should need

 the moment he loves comes up fast

 same basin 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.810
 the pressure on the sports button increases that 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:13.850
 responsiveness of the engine of this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 cayenne s diesel is so main 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.610
