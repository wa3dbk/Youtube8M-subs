00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 

one<00:00:42.630> played<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> death<00:00:43.350> road<00:00:43.560> or

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
something or even to death words and so

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.260 
something or even to death words and so
he<00:00:46.739> might<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> power<00:00:47.370> shield<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.180> I

have<00:00:48.390> never<00:00:48.900> seen<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.380> a<00:00:49.550> knife<00:00:50.550> juggler

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:11.270 

so<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.530> guess<00:01:00.770> that's<00:01:00.949> pretty<00:01:01.280> sick

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 

I<00:01:11.400> didn't<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.330> freezing<00:01:12.630> trap<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.200> kind

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I didn't get my freezing trap it's kind

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:30.460 
I didn't get my freezing trap it's kind
of<00:01:13.770> lucky

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.720 

proach<00:01:31.190> field<00:01:31.520> as<00:01:31.700> well<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:33.050> here's<00:01:33.260> a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
proach field as well so here's a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:47.219 
proach field as well so here's a
fantastic<00:01:34.730> opener<00:01:35.270> against<00:01:36.140> me

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.660 

can<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.259> kill<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.530> immediately<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.250> can't<00:01:49.520> kill

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
can I kill it immediately I can't kill

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.080 
can I kill it immediately I can't kill
this<00:01:49.789> one<00:01:49.939> next<00:01:50.359> time<00:01:50.539> with<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.780> bow<00:01:50.960> or<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:53.060> I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
this one next time with the bow or so I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.359 
this one next time with the bow or so I
think<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.719> like<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:53.929> solo<00:01:54.740> hood<00:01:55.039> dragon

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
think this is like a solo hood dragon

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.520 
think this is like a solo hood dragon
priest<00:01:55.640> because<00:01:56.000> he<00:01:56.149> plays<00:01:56.689> fairy<00:01:56.929> dragon<00:01:57.380> and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
priest because he plays fairy dragon and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.139 
priest because he plays fairy dragon and
the<00:01:57.560> only<00:01:57.740> reason<00:01:57.829> to<00:01:58.159> play<00:01:58.280> fairy<00:01:58.579> dragon<00:01:59.030> is

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
the only reason to play fairy dragon is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:08.169 
the only reason to play fairy dragon is
to<00:01:59.299> get<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.319> Dragons<00:02:00.740> energy<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.030> he

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
to get the Dragons energy so see if he

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.670 
to get the Dragons energy so see if he
has<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:10.599> like<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.900> only<00:02:11.959> reason<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.500> would

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
has a we like the only reason you would

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.619 
has a we like the only reason you would
practice<00:02:13.099> Nexus<00:02:13.640> when<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:13.970> know<00:02:14.150> when<00:02:14.510> you

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
practice Nexus when you know when you

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.589 
practice Nexus when you know when you
have<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.110> bee<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.440> your<00:02:15.530> hand<00:02:16.120> he<00:02:17.120> doesn't

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
have like a bee in your hand he doesn't

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:25.780 
have like a bee in your hand he doesn't
have<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:20.480> makes<00:02:20.690> my<00:02:24.790> disjoint

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
have it so this makes my disjoint

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.770 
have it so this makes my disjoint
extremely<00:02:26.329> strong

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.800 

I<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.760> play<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.450> mana

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
I have to play it as it is mana

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660 
I have to play it as it is mana
inefficient<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.800> don't<00:02:33.010> hear<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> power<00:02:33.520> and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
inefficient I don't hear a power and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.820 
inefficient I don't hear a power and
everything<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.660> got<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> program<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.560> those

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
everything but I got a program of those

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.380 
everything but I got a program of those

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.429 

I<00:03:37.959> might<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.140> been<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.349> mistake<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:40.790> not<00:03:41.439> kill

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.319 

thought<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:50.060> have<00:03:50.329> enough<00:03:50.659> burst<00:03:51.319> damage<00:03:51.499> to

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
thought I have enough burst damage to

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.580 
thought I have enough burst damage to
kill<00:03:53.329> him<00:03:53.480> basically<00:03:54.109> I<00:03:56.230> hope<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.379> doesn't

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
kill him basically I hope it doesn't

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.140 
kill him basically I hope it doesn't
have<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.769> death<00:04:01.750> might<00:04:02.750> try<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.079> draw<00:04:03.439> into<00:04:03.709> it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.490 

so<00:04:08.150> P<00:04:08.329> doesn't<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.689> it<00:04:08.930> if<00:04:09.079> he<00:04:09.169> doesn't<00:04:09.439> have

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
so P doesn't have it if he doesn't have

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.509 
so P doesn't have it if he doesn't have
it<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:11.139> doesn't<00:04:12.139> have<00:04:12.439> it<00:04:12.590> can't<00:04:13.189> have<00:04:13.340> like

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
it it doesn't have it can't have like
