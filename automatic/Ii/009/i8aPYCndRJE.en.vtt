control within each categories there are

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
control within each categories there are
various<00:01:36.659> differences<00:01:36.990> again<00:01:37.380> thinking<00:01:37.650> along

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
various differences again thinking along

various differences again thinking along
lines<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> spectrum<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.420> there

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
lines of the spectrum that we have there

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
lines of the spectrum that we have there
are<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.380> differences<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> construction

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
are some differences in the construction

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.800 
are some differences in the construction
of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> shoes<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> they<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.540> provide

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
of the shoes and they will provide

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.319 
of the shoes and they will provide
different<00:01:43.020> degrees<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:44.220> stability<00:01:44.610> within

different degrees of stability within
that<00:01:45.479> category<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.079> start<00:01:46.320> off<00:01:46.350> with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that category so I start off with

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
that category so I start off with

are constructed as it relates to
stability<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.490> talking<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
stability we're really talking about the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
shoes that will provide a little bit

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.100 
shoes that will provide a little bit
more<00:02:30.840> stability<00:02:31.160> an<00:02:32.160> example<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.820> that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
more stability an example of that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.570 
more stability an example of that
between<00:02:34.110> these<00:02:34.350> two<00:02:34.590> shoes<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.400> shoe

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
between these two shoes you have a shoe

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.820 
between these two shoes you have a shoe
which<00:02:36.390> actually<00:02:36.720> has<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.320> bottom<00:02:37.680> shoot

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
which actually has this bottom shoot

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
through the missile in this case it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.640 
through the missile in this case it's
called<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.120> wave<00:02:42.300> plate<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:43.260> gives<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
as it is on the lateral side so it's not

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.440 
as it is on the lateral side so it's not

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
versus the other it just gives a little
