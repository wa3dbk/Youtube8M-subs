it's going to look like so it looks like

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's going to look like so it looks like

just like an armhole in the center of
the<00:03:22.380> fabric<00:03:22.790> now<00:03:23.790> we're<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.360> pin<00:03:24.810> right

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
the fabric now we're going to pin right

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.250 
the fabric now we're going to pin right
sides<00:03:25.380> together<00:03:28.820> for<00:03:29.820> both<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.330> pink<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
blue now we're going to do this on both

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.970 
blue now we're going to do this on both
the<00:03:35.430> front<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.910> back<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> place<00:03:37.739> your

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
the front and the back so place your

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740 
the front and the back so place your
right<00:03:38.130> side<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> fabric<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.300> get<00:03:39.450> out<00:03:39.600> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
right side of the fabric to get out you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.720 
right side of the fabric to get out you
can<00:03:39.900> see<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.080> pull<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.590> entire<00:03:40.920> blue<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.520> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
can see I pull the entire blue on the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.420 
can see I pull the entire blue on the
pink<00:03:42.030> place<00:03:42.780> right<00:03:43.080> sides<00:03:43.350> together<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.920> pinned

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
pink place right sides together I pinned

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.160 
pink place right sides together I pinned
it<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.970> then<00:03:45.150> we're<00:03:45.330> going<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.540> sew<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
it and then we're going to sew it on the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.100 
it and then we're going to sew it on the
wrong<00:03:46.380> side<00:03:47.450> hope<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.690> wasn't<00:03:48.870> too

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
wrong side hope that wasn't too

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.100 
wrong side hope that wasn't too
confusing<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:53.670> course<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.090> pattern<00:03:54.959> is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
confusing and of course this pattern is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.550 
confusing and of course this pattern is
totally<00:03:55.530> adjustable<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.340> am<00:03:56.489> using<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.420> form<00:03:58.410> of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
totally adjustable I am using a form of

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.710 
totally adjustable I am using a form of
a<00:03:58.650> CREP<00:03:58.980> material<00:03:59.640> but<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.390> could<00:04:00.570> use

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
a CREP material but you could use

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720 
a CREP material but you could use
spandex<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.530> could<00:04:01.739> use<00:04:01.920> cotton<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.580> could

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
spandex you could use cotton you could

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.009 
spandex you could use cotton you could
use<00:04:02.880> whatever<00:04:03.180> fabric<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.380> hand

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.420 

okay<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:10.500> what<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.800> looks<00:04:10.950> like<00:04:11.100> once

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
okay and that's what it looks like once

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.250 
okay and that's what it looks like once
we're<00:04:11.670> done<00:04:11.940> pannon<00:04:13.970> now<00:04:14.970> once<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.989> go<00:04:16.140> ahead

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
we're done pannon now once you go ahead

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.610 
we're done pannon now once you go ahead
and<00:04:16.530> use<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.090> locate<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.330> center<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
and use so that locate the center of the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.409 
and use so that locate the center of the
top<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.250> fabric<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.790> just<00:04:21.000> put<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> little

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
top of the fabric and just put a little

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.280 
top of the fabric and just put a little
snip<00:04:23.240> just<00:04:24.240> note<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.600> center<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> fabric

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
snip just note the center of the fabric

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.500 
snip just note the center of the fabric
wouldn't<00:04:25.860> be<00:04:26.070> where<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.310> join<00:04:26.760> because<00:04:27.000> we<00:04:27.300> do

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
wouldn't be where you join because we do

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.659 
wouldn't be where you join because we do
have<00:04:27.720> uneven<00:04:28.230> pieces<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.190> that's<00:04:29.370> the

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
have uneven pieces and that's the

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.170 
have uneven pieces and that's the
pattern<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:32.539> just<00:04:33.539> bear<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:33.900> in

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
pattern so just bear that in

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.500 
pattern so just bear that in
so<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:36.140> bear<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.770> mind<00:04:37.120> now<00:04:38.120> measure

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
so just bear that in mind now measure

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.340 
so just bear that in mind now measure
from<00:04:38.720> where<00:04:39.170> we<00:04:39.320> put<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.710> snip<00:04:40.120> outwards<00:04:41.350> 6.5

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
from where we put the snip outwards 6.5

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.620 
from where we put the snip outwards 6.5
on<00:04:42.680> either<00:04:43.310> side<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:43.790> it's<00:04:44.240> going<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.480> be<00:04:44.600> a

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
on either side so it's going to be a

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.650 
on either side so it's going to be a
total<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.260> 13<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:50.120> what<00:04:50.270> we're<00:04:50.450> going<00:04:50.600> to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
total of 13 and then what we're going to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.440 
total of 13 and then what we're going to
do<00:04:50.840> we're<00:04:51.020> going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.260> pin<00:04:51.620> from<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.280> 6.5<00:04:53.150> line

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
I measured two inches down because that

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.230 
I measured two inches down because that
is<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.290> width<00:06:41.530> of<00:06:41.650> my<00:06:41.800> ribbon<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:42.820> I'm<00:06:42.970> going

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
to use I chose to use a blue ribbon

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.310 
to use I chose to use a blue ribbon
because<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:46.030> figured<00:06:46.480> there<00:06:46.660> was<00:06:46.810> a<00:06:46.840> lot<00:06:47.170> of

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
because I figured there was a lot of

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.140 
because I figured there was a lot of
pink<00:06:47.590> already<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.460> blue<00:06:48.610> ribbon<00:06:49.000> would

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
pink already and the blue ribbon would

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.670 
pink already and the blue ribbon would
add<00:06:49.330> some<00:06:49.570> character<00:06:49.900> to<00:06:50.320> it

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
add some character to it

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.950 
add some character to it

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
so I measured two inches down for my

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.110 
so I measured two inches down for my
ribbon<00:06:53.350> and<00:06:53.560> what<00:06:54.070> I<00:06:54.100> did<00:06:54.370> I<00:06:54.400> went<00:06:54.700> on<00:06:54.940> my
