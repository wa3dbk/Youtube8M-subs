00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.220 
the biggest con that I have with it is
the<00:01:57.620> bulges<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:58.730> kind<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.150> hard<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.570> hide<00:01:59.930> but

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
the bulges it's kind of hard to hide but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.450 
the bulges it's kind of hard to hide but
even<00:02:00.470> though<00:02:00.620> I<00:02:00.650> look<00:02:00.800> like<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.250> have<00:02:01.370> an

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
even though I look like I have an

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.340 
even though I look like I have an
hourglass<00:02:01.910> figure<00:02:02.150> you<00:02:02.780> can<00:02:02.930> see<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.050> bulge

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
hourglass figure you can see a bulge

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.400 
hourglass figure you can see a bulge
here<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.950> see<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> bulge<00:02:04.460> there<00:02:04.910> in<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.170> back

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
here you see a bulge there in the back

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.370 
here you see a bulge there in the back
so<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.520> unnatural<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:08.630> at<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.110> top

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
so that is unnatural and then at the top

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.650 
so that is unnatural and then at the top
work<00:02:09.650> back<00:02:10.100> fat<00:02:10.369> issues<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.120> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
work back fat issues that I have you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.870 
work back fat issues that I have you
still<00:02:11.960> see<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.560> that's<00:02:12.740> one<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.640> probably

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
still see it so that's one of probably

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.480 
still see it so that's one of probably
the<00:02:14.090> biggest<00:02:14.480> issues<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
the biggest issues that I have in the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.880 
the biggest issues that I have in the
unnaturalness<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.170> black<00:02:18.680> go

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
unnaturalness of it and a black go

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.070 
unnaturalness of it and a black go
support<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:20.000> doesn't<00:02:20.450> feel<00:02:20.600> good<00:02:20.840> when<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
support it it doesn't feel good when I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.300 
support it it doesn't feel good when I
sit<00:02:21.350> down<00:02:21.380> awesome<00:02:24.550> okay<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.010> all

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
sit down awesome okay so this is all

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.310

is<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.440> love<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.830> way<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> back<00:02:35.210> it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
is I love the way that in the back it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320 
is I love the way that in the back it
looks<00:02:36.110> small<00:02:36.440> my<00:02:36.830> button<00:02:37.220> looks<00:02:37.370> great<00:02:37.760> but

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
looks small my button looks great but

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.880 
looks small my button looks great but
the<00:02:38.390> drawback<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.290> look<00:02:39.440> really<00:02:39.620> closely

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the drawback if you look really closely

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.810 
the drawback if you look really closely
yeah<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.550> looks<00:02:40.730> great<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:43.130> has<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.670> be

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
yeah that looks great but it has to be

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.480 
yeah that looks great but it has to be
low<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.350> not<00:02:45.440> loose<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
low because if it's not loose in the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.810 
low because if it's not loose in the
back<00:02:46.670> oh<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.300> goodness<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:48.230> looks<00:02:48.410> weird<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.700> I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
back oh my goodness it looks weird and I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.600 
back oh my goodness it looks weird and I
feel<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.620> pull<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.040> tight<00:02:52.280> it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
feel like like if I pull it tight it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.150 
feel like like if I pull it tight it
looks<00:02:52.790> kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.090> weird<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.750> not<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.710> that

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
looks kind of weird so it's not it that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.790 
looks kind of weird so it's not it that
looks<00:02:55.610> sexy<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.240> looks<00:02:56.420> good<00:02:56.780> um<00:02:57.380> another

looks sexy it looks good um another

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.140 
looks sexy it looks good um another
drawback<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.670> that<00:03:00.250> noise<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.610> feel<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:02.030> I'm

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
drawback is that noise I feel like I'm

walking in corduroys so I have to be
cognizant<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.850> feel<00:03:05.540> very<00:03:05.600> supported

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
cognizant of that I feel very supported

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.560 
cognizant of that I feel very supported
