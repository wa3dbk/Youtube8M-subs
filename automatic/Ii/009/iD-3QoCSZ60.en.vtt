00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello, welcome back to everyone as I had 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.440
 anticipated on facebook 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 as you could read from the title 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300
 today will be the first video dedicated to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.530
 heading the new heading the enamel of the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 week 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
 so why didn't he read on facebook 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 that my post will explain you about this 70 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 every week I will publish a bathroom where 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.510
 I will show you the drafting in detail 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.449
 of a glaze that I liked then 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 which I promote absolutely for what 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.600
 concerns let's say surrender and therefore every 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.700
 week there will be a video itself 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 then you can do then leave me a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 video response maybe photos on 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.300
 facebook I leave you the link of mine 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 Facebook page where you can then 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.579
 put in the picture set the video of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.850
 answer of a nail polish than in this 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.160
 period even if it is not a week 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.600
 I'm enjoying it 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 in this way then we could 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.449
 exchange opinions advice for how much 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.220
 it's about the enamels and the polish I have 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.430
 chosen today is the chorus that the number derby 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.619
 60 it's a glaze then mine 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.869
 favorite nail polish if you go to watch the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 my first video you will notice that I have it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.420
 I used to do my own before 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.080
 art and is the number 60 as I said a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.880
 super super blue smurf color 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.670
 nice now we're going to see the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 I also tell you how much mine is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.009
 lasted with the application without top coat 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.970
 so girls follow the video for 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 see all the details of this glaze 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.000
 color play number 60 is called 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.110
 bold blue so as you can well see 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.259
 I really remember the color of the smurfs 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.390
 applicator brush is enough 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.270
 thin but now I'm out too 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 debts with the easiest maxi brush 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 for drawing up 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.290
 so let's get to work with this 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.009
 enamel we immediately notice that the coverage 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.870
 already in the first pass is enough 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.420
 excellent but I prefer for how much 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.230
 regards this color to always give two 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:39.750
 because it really gives me up 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:42.000
 particularly bright and shiny I go to 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.730
 then give my second pass of 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.890
 nail polish and as you can well see the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:03:08.630
 color becomes really more intense is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:03:11.640
 drying times are almost over 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.010
 of plaid enamels and b are 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.500
 fairly fast and therefore in five 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.799
 minutes we already have the enamel that we are 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.290
 dried the duration of this polish on 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.269
 so it's four days of me 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.430
 quite reasonable also because later 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.209
 already after three days I want to already a 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.850
 change color of polish I wanted 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.549
 also add that there is a novelty for 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.019
 as far as I'm concerned , I want to 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.609
