 and maybe to see life 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.880
 I do not say anything to a ridiculous combat 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:27.120
 because I wanted to stretch my ark down 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:29.450
 I bought it instead of occupying a lot 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.400
 a girl like you 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.400
 can not be in a place like this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.650

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.640
