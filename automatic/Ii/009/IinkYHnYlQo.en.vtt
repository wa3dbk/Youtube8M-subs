00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hi everyone, I am here in my studio 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:13.590
 to register a group that must today 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.770
 make a simple demo a tribute band e 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 I'll show you how I like you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 I am organized without using it at all 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.939
 the computer that is I will use it only later 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.539
 when I will pour all the traces on 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.769
 on the editing program then how 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 I will use recorder in Hong Kong 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:39.649
 this is an 888 korg with eight tracks 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 which records on hard disk so I'll put it 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 on the first channel the cash register for ii 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.899
 iii panoramic battery then 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.949
 I'll put the guitar down 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:02.160
 the keyboard is a voice then the voice la 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.899
 I will record later for per 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.619
 have a better yield because here since 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.360
 alive then microphones will enter microphone 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.400
 in the voice I say it will take the others too 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 tools and therefore it will be a bit of a mess 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 then the word aris three ro after is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 given that the base is still the voice 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.159
 I send it anyway to give to give 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 opportunities for the musicians of elia of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.369
 to hear it and to play better then I will use 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.579
 here wide for the low where I will use the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.030
 successful line that will then go will go to 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.950
 connect on the a8 tracks in here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.130
 I'll put the guitar amp on it 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.549
 excused the noises but today there is a traffic 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.320
 I'll put lightning here 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 guitar then I will close the box and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:03.780
 so it will feel very little outside it is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.869
 here is the 757 microphone with cables that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.300
 they come out the and then they go to finish the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.540
 step back then it ends up on 28 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.319
 tracks here voice microphone for the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.620
 guitarist 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.389
 to have a line to have 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.230
 a vocal line I will put you all the 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:24.090
 keyboard is still not there and the battery 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.469
 this one the usual batteries 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.819
 residential with the two neumann like 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:34.109
 panoramic and a microphone in front of the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.109
 cash desk 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:40.439
 I did the experiment already and it comes a lot 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:44.159
 very well with two panoramic microphones 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.680
 the dishes are good 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.840
 come benito oms certainly not like 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.879
 was a professional situation though 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.519
 it comes very very well it's all here then 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:04.049
 crow headphone output 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:06.090
 here there are three of them, we see it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:12.000
 Shia raven bonnet attached to a 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:16.290
 headphone amplifier where one will be released 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.069
 headphones for me another headset for the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:28.290
 drummer two double-headed headphones 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:33.139
 tower for guitarist and bass player and one 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.970
 headphone for the keyboard 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.909
 I advise regarding the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.220
 headphones if you play live in everyone 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:45.299
 inside the same room I recommend the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.239
 headphones that are headphone insulators 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:54.870
 which in any case like these from a 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.299
 opportunity to exclude a bit of everything 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.219
 what comes from the outside to 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:09.409
 example for the drummer I use the 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:11.879
 gift these close a lot then 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.229
 we hear a lot what who is in 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.229
 couple and little what comes from outside 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:29.479
 drummer will bring his dishes on 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:33.830
 snare drum and so on I will pour everything into the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.370
 pci where i 'm going to make the mix 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.909
 legalizations in the various tracks 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:45.409
 addition of affected corrections and on 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:45.409
 saying ok hi to all
