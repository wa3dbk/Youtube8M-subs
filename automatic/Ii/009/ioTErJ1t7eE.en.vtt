cymbals<00:00:26.160> demo<00:00:26.580> video<00:00:26.939> i<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
cymbals demo video i think it's the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.880 
cymbals demo video i think it's the
m-series<00:00:28.560> fusion<00:00:29.189> cymbals<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.710> look

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
m-series fusion cymbals and this look

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
m-series fusion cymbals and this look
was<00:00:32.009> only<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> couple<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.270> seconds

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
was only in it for a couple of seconds

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
was only in it for a couple of seconds
in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.380> middle<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> video<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.190> really

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
in the middle of the video but really

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.069 
in the middle of the video but really
caught<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.820> attention<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.480> had<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> figure<00:00:36.960> out

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
caught my attention I had to figure out

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
caught my attention I had to figure out
what<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> learn<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> play<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what it was and learn how to play it and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.040 
what it was and learn how to play it and
I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.090> once<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> hear<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.570> you'll<00:00:39.750> find<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I think once you hear it you'll find it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.959 
I think once you hear it you'll find it
really<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.770> cool<00:00:40.920> too<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.820> you'll

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
really really cool too I think you'll

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.340 
really really cool too I think you'll
enjoy<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.899> let's<00:00:43.530> check<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.860> out

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
enjoy it a lot so let's check it out

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.520 
enjoy it a lot so let's check it out
okay

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
okay

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
okay
so<00:00:46.710> here's<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:47.190> sounds<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:52.550> okay

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so here's what the look sounds like okay

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.590 
so here's what the look sounds like okay
so<00:00:54.350> let's<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.370> base<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.270> link

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so let's look at the base of this link

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
so let's look at the base of this link
and<00:00:57.780> what's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.120> the<00:01:00.120> pattern<00:01:00.829> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and what's going on so the pattern that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
and what's going on so the pattern that
makes<00:01:02.039> us<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> base<00:01:02.699> pattern<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.500> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
makes us up the base pattern is this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
makes us up the base pattern is this
which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:09.320> which<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.350> straight<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.760> no

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
which is which is straight it's no

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.560 
which is which is straight it's no
triplets<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:13.470> sixteenth<00:01:14.130> notes<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.760> 32nd

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
triplets at sixteenth notes and 32nd

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.330 
triplets at sixteenth notes and 32nd
notes<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.799> 3/16<00:01:19.799> pattern<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
notes and it's just this 3/16 pattern in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
notes and it's just this 3/16 pattern in
the<00:01:20.460> hands<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.720> repeats<00:01:22.290> over<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> over

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the hands that repeats over and over

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
the hands that repeats over and over
again<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.670> he's<00:01:23.820> putting<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> over<00:01:24.390> eighth

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
again and he's putting it over eighth

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
again and he's putting it over eighth
notes<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> feet<00:01:25.680> which<00:01:25.979> gives<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
notes and the feet which gives it that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.600 
notes and the feet which gives it that
cool<00:01:27.380> 3<00:01:28.380> over<00:01:28.560> 2<00:01:28.770> feel<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> makes<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> feel

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
cool 3 over 2 feel that makes it feel

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.539 
cool 3 over 2 feel that makes it feel
like<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.759> always<00:01:30.060> changing<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.439> let's<00:01:32.310> look

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
like it's always changing so let's look

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.170 
like it's always changing so let's look
at<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.170> hands<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> second<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
at just the hands for a second so the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.830 
at just the hands for a second so the
hands<00:01:36.659> slowly<00:01:37.350> are

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.550 

and<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.770> base<00:01:47.010> unit<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:51.560> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and the base unit of that is just so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.750 
and the base unit of that is just so
it's<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.820> flam<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.290> left<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> so

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
it's just flam right right left and so

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.570 
it's just flam right right left and so
you<00:01:57.090> should<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.390> wailing<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:57.990> flam<00:01:58.580> ghosting

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
you should be wailing the flam ghosting

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.120 
you should be wailing the flam ghosting
the<00:01:59.760> two<00:02:00.090> rights<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:01.320> smashing<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the two rights and then smashing the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.330 
the two rights and then smashing the
left<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:03.300> that's<00:02:03.660> just<00:02:03.960> sixteen<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:05.310> thirty

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
left and that's just sixteen to thirty

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:20.870 
left and that's just sixteen to thirty
Seconds<00:02:06.290> sixteen<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.820> slowly<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> all

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
Seconds sixteen so slowly and so all

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.150 
Seconds sixteen so slowly and so all
he's<00:02:21.120> doing<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.660> cycling<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> over<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.980> over

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
he's doing is cycling that over and over

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.810 
he's doing is cycling that over and over
and<00:02:23.520> over<00:02:23.910> again<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:26.209> together<00:02:27.230> slowly<00:02:28.820> use

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and over again so together slowly use

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:44.090 
and over again so together slowly use
the<00:02:30.209> hands<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.260> feet<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:42.950> once<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> get

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the hands and the feet so once you get

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.009 
the hands and the feet so once you get
the<00:02:44.160> hands<00:02:44.370> down<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:45.269> put<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.540> over<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> feet

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
the hands down can put it over the feet

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.729 
the hands down can put it over the feet
and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:48.090> once<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> get<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.019> feet<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.380> you

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
and then once you get the feet down you

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.490 
and then once you get the feet down you
can<00:02:50.250> start<00:02:50.489> playing<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.630> way<00:02:51.780> Benny<00:02:51.989> plays<00:02:52.290> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
can start playing the way Benny plays it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.290 
can start playing the way Benny plays it
and<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> way<00:02:52.920> Benny<00:02:53.100> plays<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.820> he

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
and so the way Benny plays it is he

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.280 
and so the way Benny plays it is he
starts<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:56.010> two<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.239> way<00:02:57.450> he

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
starts it on the two and that way he

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.550 
starts it on the two and that way he
plays<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.709> hand<00:02:58.950> cycle<00:02:59.580> four<00:02:59.910> times<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
plays the hand cycle four times and the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.229 
plays the hand cycle four times and the
end<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.920> fourth<00:03:02.280> time<00:03:02.519> coincides<00:03:03.120> with

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
end of that fourth time coincides with

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.360 
end of that fourth time coincides with
the<00:03:03.390> end<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> bar<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.800> all<00:03:04.920> works<00:03:05.160> out

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the end of the bar so it all works out

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.110 
the end of the bar so it all works out
pretty<00:03:05.640> evenly<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:07.200> he<00:03:07.650> also<00:03:07.830> leads<00:03:08.640> into<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
pretty evenly and he also leads into it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.690 
pretty evenly and he also leads into it
with<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.390> ghosted<00:03:09.989> pickup<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.590> end<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.220> one

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
with a ghosted pickup on the end of one

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.460 
with a ghosted pickup on the end of one
sorry<00:03:12.630> uh<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.400> snare<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.959> slowly

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
sorry uh of one on the snare so slowly

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:33.570 
sorry uh of one on the snare so slowly
the<00:03:17.220> way<00:03:17.370> Benny<00:03:17.580> plays<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.150> is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.810 

so<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:36.200> makes<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.740> sound<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:37.010> lot<00:03:37.130> cool<00:03:37.400> and

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
so that makes it sound a lot cool and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.250 
so that makes it sound a lot cool and
really<00:03:38.120> makes<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.390> fit<00:03:38.660> into<00:03:38.810> what<00:03:39.140> you're

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
really makes it fit into what you're

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.380 
really makes it fit into what you're
planning<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.740> lot<00:03:39.890> better<00:03:40.130> but<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.240> just

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
planning a lot better but you can just

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.880 
planning a lot better but you can just
take<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.690> pattern<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.260> move<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.560> around<00:03:42.650> the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
take that pattern and move it around the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.380 
take that pattern and move it around the
kit<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.870> use<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.080> fill<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.470> other<00:03:45.620> things

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
kit and use it to fill in other things

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.380 
kit and use it to fill in other things
so<00:03:47.920> altogether<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.790> what<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.060> sounds

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
so altogether this is what it sounds

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.540 
so altogether this is what it sounds
like<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:51.080> be<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:52.070> way

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
like just be the way

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.340 
like just be the way
Benny<00:03:52.820> plays<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.480> kind<00:03:53.960> of<00:03:54.020> with<00:03:54.140> some<00:03:54.260> of

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
Benny plays it and kind of with some of

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:29.280 
Benny plays it and kind of with some of
the<00:03:54.440> stuff<00:03:54.590> like<00:03:54.770> he<00:03:54.950> plays<00:03:55.490> in<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.790> video<00:04:28.210> so

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
the stuff like he plays in the video so

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.930 
the stuff like he plays in the video so
it<00:04:30.290> takes<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.560> while<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.740> get<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.070> pattern<00:04:31.310> and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
it takes a while to get this pattern and

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.670 
it takes a while to get this pattern and
it's<00:04:32.270> kind<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:32.720> awkward<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:33.140> play<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.350> first

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
it's kind of awkward to play it first

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.230 
it's kind of awkward to play it first
you<00:04:33.860> kind<00:04:34.040> of<00:04:34.070> have<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.220> whip<00:04:34.490> your<00:04:34.670> hand<00:04:34.970> back

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
you kind of have to whip your hand back

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.420 
you kind of have to whip your hand back
and<00:04:35.270> forth<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.530> almost<00:04:36.800> doing<00:04:36.980> broken

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
and forth and it's almost doing broken

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.830 
and forth and it's almost doing broken
doubles<00:04:37.790> because<00:04:38.000> you're<00:04:38.930> going<00:04:40.450> right<00:04:41.450> from

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
doubles because you're going right from

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.860 
doubles because you're going right from
a<00:04:42.460> flam<00:04:43.460> leading<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.270> right<00:04:44.420> hand<00:04:44.630> right

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
a flam leading with the right hand right

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.450 
a flam leading with the right hand right
into<00:04:45.170> more<00:04:45.380> doubles<00:04:45.890> over<00:04:46.040> here<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.280> gotta

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
into more doubles over here so you gotta

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.040 
into more doubles over here so you gotta
get<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:48.670> motion<00:04:49.670> down<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:50.870> sit

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
get the motion down and so you just sit

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.970 
get the motion down and so you just sit
there<00:04:51.170> and<00:04:51.230> just<00:04:51.350> go<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.140> have<00:04:57.230> to<00:04:57.410> get

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
there and just go is you have to get

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.230 
there and just go is you have to get
used<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.310> whipping<00:04:58.670> your<00:04:58.760> hand<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.210> and

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
used to whipping your hand back and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.390 
used to whipping your hand back and
forth<00:04:59.450> however<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.500> shouldn't<00:05:00.800> be<00:05:01.070> turning

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
forth however you shouldn't be turning

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.820 
forth however you shouldn't be turning
it<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.790> shouldn't<00:05:02.090> be<00:05:02.180> doing<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.540> motion

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
it you shouldn't be doing that motion

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.430 
it you shouldn't be doing that motion
you<00:05:03.830> should<00:05:04.010> be<00:05:04.360> doing<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.600> move<00:05:06.050> over<00:05:06.260> here<00:05:06.410> I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
you should be doing a move over here I

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.780 
you should be doing a move over here I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
straight over because sometimes people

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.670 
straight over because sometimes people
do<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:11.960> then<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.140> end<00:05:12.260> apart<00:05:12.500> in<00:05:12.590> your
