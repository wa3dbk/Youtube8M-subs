okay<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:00.840> as<00:00:01.079> promised<00:00:01.500> that<00:00:01.589> was<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.829> world's

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay so as promised that was the world's

okay so as promised that was the world's

moving on to wise memory important

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.709 
moving on to wise memory important
specifically<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.820> obviously<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> book<00:00:09.540> has

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
specifically what obviously the book has

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780 
specifically what obviously the book has
to<00:00:09.900> say<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.080> why<00:00:10.500> memory<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.920> important<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
to say about why memory is important the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.789 
to say about why memory is important the
author<00:00:11.969> asks<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.599> particular<00:00:13.290> question<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
author asks a particular question and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.279 
author asks a particular question and
that<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.599> think<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.049> fairly

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
that is and I think it's a fairly

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.800 
that is and I think it's a fairly
profound<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:17.039> sure<00:00:17.850> philosophers<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
profound one sure philosophers over the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.099 
profound one sure philosophers over the
years<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.410> contemplated<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:21.109> until

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
years have contemplated this one until

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
years have contemplated this one until
there<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.590> bled<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.730> maintains<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
there is bled but what maintains the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.120 
there is bled but what maintains the
illusion<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> continuity<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
illusion that there is a continuity of

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.730 
illusion that there is a continuity of
life<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.760> humans<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.420> us<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:28.349> moment<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
life for humans for us from moment to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.939 
life for humans for us from moment to
moment<00:00:28.849> what<00:00:29.849> does<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.560> asked

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
moment what does do that and so we asked

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.490 
moment what does do that and so we asked
that<00:00:32.070> question<00:00:32.270> if<00:00:33.270> any<00:00:33.420> suggests<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that question if any suggests that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
10 years old but for memory otherwise

there's<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.210> new<00:01:09.450> me<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.900> different

there's it's all new me it's a different

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480 
there's it's all new me it's a different
person<00:01:10.500> walking<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.310> how

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
person walking around so that's how

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.039 
person walking around so that's how
important<00:01:11.909> memory<00:01:12.150> seems<00:01:12.360> being<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> core

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
important memory seems being the core

important memory seems being the core

thing core concept of continuity another
question<00:01:16.229> he<00:01:16.290> asks<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.100> no

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
question he asks is what if you had no

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
question he asks is what if you had no
memory<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.200> let's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
memory so how important is it well let's

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
memory so how important is it well let's
see<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.159> happens<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.640> no

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
see if you what happens if you had no

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.080 
see if you what happens if you had no
memory<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.600> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> person<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> be

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
memory what kind of person would you be

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
memory what kind of person would you be
so<00:01:24.090> he<00:01:24.570> finds<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.290> individual<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.159> no

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so he finds an individual that has no

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130 
so he finds an individual that has no
memory<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:27.000> essentially<00:01:27.330> no<00:01:27.600> memory<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.020> has

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
memory will essentially no memory he has

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
memory will essentially no memory he has
the<00:01:28.320> last<00:01:28.530> working<00:01:28.860> thought<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.520> believe<00:01:29.820> still

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the last working thought I believe still

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760 
the last working thought I believe still
in<00:01:30.509> short-term<00:01:30.869> memory<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.500> otherwise

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in short-term memory but otherwise

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
in short-term memory but otherwise
everything's<00:01:32.400> forgotten<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.750> he

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
everything's forgotten and so he

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.670 
everything's forgotten and so he
interviews<00:01:34.259> his<00:01:34.439> fellow<00:01:34.680> extensively<00:01:35.540> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
interviews his fellow extensively and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
interviews his fellow extensively and
what<00:01:37.680> he<00:01:37.799> does<00:01:38.070> find<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.360> person

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
what he does find is that this person

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
what he does find is that this person
does<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.439> terms<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.950> personhood

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
does have what he terms a personhood

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.460 
does have what he terms a personhood
which<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.060> guess<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> some<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> essence<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
which I guess is some kind of essence of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
which I guess is some kind of essence of
personality<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> conversation

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
personality so you have a conversation

interesting<00:02:33.530> experiment<00:02:34.159> that<00:02:34.519> was

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
interesting experiment that was

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.819 
interesting experiment that was
conducted<00:02:34.639> by<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.209> French<00:02:35.569> chrono<00:02:35.989> biologist<00:02:36.709> I

conducted by a French chrono biologist I

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.979 
conducted by a French chrono biologist I
didn't<00:02:37.040> even<00:02:37.219> know<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.569> occupation<00:02:38.569> existed

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
didn't even know that occupation existed

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.199 
didn't even know that occupation existed
but<00:02:39.109> apparently<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.620> does<00:02:39.769> French<00:02:40.760> fellow<00:02:40.969> bon

but apparently it does French fellow bon
anniversaire<00:02:42.010> his<00:02:43.010> experiment<00:02:43.609> entailed<00:02:44.000> him

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
anniversaire his experiment entailed him

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.089 
anniversaire his experiment entailed him
disappearing<00:02:45.079> into<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.409> cave<00:02:45.650> for<00:02:45.859> two<00:02:46.069> months

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
disappearing into a cave for two months

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.729 
disappearing into a cave for two months
I<00:02:46.549> know<00:02:47.419> if<00:02:47.659> two<00:02:48.079> months<00:02:48.349> off<00:02:48.439> I'm<00:02:48.560> probably

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
I know if two months off I'm probably

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.409 
I know if two months off I'm probably
not<00:02:48.889> going<00:02:49.040> into<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> cave<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:49.730> he<00:02:49.879> did<00:02:50.120> for<00:02:50.389> a

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:50.419 
not going into a cave but he did for a

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.509 
not going into a cave but he did for a
particular<00:02:50.989> reason<00:02:51.349> he<00:02:51.950> went<00:02:52.159> in<00:02:52.280> there<00:02:52.430> with

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
particular reason he went in there with

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.699 
particular reason he went in there with
no<00:02:52.700> clocks<00:02:53.030> no<00:02:53.299> stimuli<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.109> he<00:02:54.409> stayed<00:02:54.680> for

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
no clocks no stimuli and he stayed for

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.909 
no clocks no stimuli and he stayed for
two<00:02:55.040> months<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.459> said<00:02:56.439> after<00:02:57.439> two<00:02:57.590> months<00:02:57.829> he

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
two months as I said after two months he

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.830 
two months as I said after two months he
was<00:02:58.040> released<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:59.269> think<00:02:59.480> his<00:02:59.689> first

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
was released and I think his first

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.659 
was released and I think his first
question<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.439> his<00:03:00.590> read<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:01.370> people<00:03:01.639> that

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
question to his read to the people that

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.879 
question to his read to the people that
released<00:03:02.030> him<00:03:02.239> or<00:03:02.510> was<00:03:03.109> why<00:03:03.379> did<00:03:03.439> you<00:03:03.590> let<00:03:03.829> me

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
released him or was why did you let me

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.099 
released him or was why did you let me
out<00:03:04.040> after<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.549> one<00:03:04.760> month<00:03:04.790> he<00:03:05.239> thought<00:03:05.599> only

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
that as you grow up you're

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.260 
that as you grow up you're
memories<00:04:24.010> seem<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.610> very<00:04:24.640> rich<00:04:25.060> when

memories seem to be very rich when

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.210 
memories seem to be very rich when
you're<00:04:25.420> young<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.900> they<00:04:25.990> seem<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.200> be<00:04:26.320> stack

you're young and they seem to be stack

you're young and they seem to be stack

James is that in youth we have an

James is that in youth we have an

every day but as each hour passes we

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.730 
every day but as each hour passes we

which we had to notice at all you know
so<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.320> days<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.830> week's<00:04:51.070> kind<00:04:51.370> of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
so the days and the week's kind of

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.910 
so the days and the week's kind of
smooth<00:04:51.730> themselves<00:04:52.210> out<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:53.350> they<00:04:53.650> smooth

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
smooth themselves out and they smooth

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.750 
smooth themselves out and they smooth
out<00:04:54.070> into<00:04:54.370> con<00:04:54.820> no<00:04:55.620> content<00:04:56.620> less<00:04:56.830> units<00:04:57.520> and

out into con no content less units and

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.090 
out into con no content less units and
the<00:04:57.850> years<00:04:58.180> grow<00:04:58.630> hollow<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.110> collapse<00:04:59.440> it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
the years grow hollow and collapse it's

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.980 
the years grow hollow and collapse it's
pretty<00:05:00.460> profound<00:05:00.820> probably<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.540> little<00:05:01.690> bit<00:05:01.870> of

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
pretty profound probably a little bit of

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.480 
pretty profound probably a little bit of
dramatic<00:05:02.440> but<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.710> feel<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.100> this<00:05:03.430> is

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
dramatic but I feel that this is

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.800 
dramatic but I feel that this is
certainly<00:05:03.910> something<00:05:04.150> that<00:05:04.270> we<00:05:04.420> can<00:05:04.600> see

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
certainly something that we can see

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.840 
certainly something that we can see
psychologically<00:05:05.620> with<00:05:05.770> memory<00:05:06.130> our<00:05:06.610> life

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
psychologically with memory our life

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.570 
psychologically with memory our life
seemed<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.150> speed<00:05:07.630> up<00:05:07.810> as<00:05:08.020> we<00:05:08.230> get<00:05:08.470> older

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
seemed to speed up as we get older

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.370 
seemed to speed up as we get older
because<00:05:09.580> life<00:05:09.970> gets<00:05:10.330> less<00:05:10.660> interesting<00:05:11.230> in<00:05:11.320> a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
because life gets less interesting in a

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.970 
because life gets less interesting in a
lot<00:05:11.500> of<00:05:11.530> ways<00:05:11.710> less<00:05:12.010> memorable<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:13.690> so<00:05:14.020> you
