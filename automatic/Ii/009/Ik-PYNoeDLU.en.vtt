was best hair Andrew robots and a yellow
player<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.429> based<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.240> two<00:00:12.450> robots<00:00:12.809> we

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
player was based here and two robots we

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.320 
player was based here and two robots we
also<00:00:13.559> see<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.309> crystals<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
also see that there are crystals on the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.080 
also see that there are crystals on the
game<00:00:15.480> board<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.440> players<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.520> want<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
game board which the players we want to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.170 
game board which the players we want to
fetch<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.750> bring<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.859> their<00:00:20.010> bases<00:00:20.279> each

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
fetch and bring back to their bases each

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.929 
fetch and bring back to their bases each
time<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.840> player<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.740> bring<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.369> crystal<00:00:23.789> in

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
time a player will bring a crystal in

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
time a player will bring a crystal in
these<00:00:24.119> days<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.470> crystal<00:00:25.890> from<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
these days when your crystal from the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.370 
these days when your crystal from the
crystal<00:00:26.640> track<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.570> will<00:00:28.230> be

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
crystal track which is here will be

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609 
crystal track which is here will be
brought<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:28.859> play<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.570> if<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:31.019> example<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
brought into play so if for example this

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.950 
brought into play so if for example this
crystal<00:00:32.070> goes<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> belly<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.750> new

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
crystal goes into the belly then a new

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
crystal goes into the belly then a new
crystal<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.530> appear<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.550> center<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
crystal will appear on the center of the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.229 
crystal will appear on the center of the
game<00:00:36.690> board<00:00:36.930> should<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.309> center<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> game

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
game board should the center of the game

world already be occupied by a crystal

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.180 
world already be occupied by a crystal
by<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> robot<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.469> player<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
by a robot then the player will have the

choice to put it on a lot of three heads

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
choice to put it on a lot of three heads
just<00:00:47.370> around<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.539> all<00:00:48.809> occupied

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
just around it if they are all occupied

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.000 
just around it if they are all occupied

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
players have the others are very simple

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069 
players have the others are very simple
for<00:01:31.200> example<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.579> first<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
for example on the first if it's the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
for example on the first if it's the
blue<00:01:34.350> player<00:01:34.619> plays<00:01:35.040> first<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.810> put<00:01:37.049> one

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
blue player plays first I can put one

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.510 
blue player plays first I can put one
order<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.549> each<00:01:38.970> robot<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
order on each robot so if I do this and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
order on each robot so if I do this and
then<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.630> or<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.110> will<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.159> first

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
then I will or I will have the first

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.469 
then I will or I will have the first
robot<00:01:44.880> who<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:45.810> nothing<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.399> goes<00:01:47.729> one

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
robot who does nothing then he goes one

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.990 
robot who does nothing then he goes one
hex<00:01:48.720> forward<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.860> nothing<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> second

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
hex forward then nothing then the second

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
hex forward then nothing then the second
robot<00:01:51.270> goes<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.869> head<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.399> nothing

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
robot goes to head so on then nothing

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
robot goes to head so on then nothing
then<00:01:54.030> nothing<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> first

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
then nothing and that's it for the first

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.090 
then nothing and that's it for the first
turn<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> blue<00:01:56.850> platter<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.799> yellow

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
turn of the blue platter now the yellow

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
turn of the blue platter now the yellow
player<00:01:59.430> does<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> same<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.479> puts<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.020> order

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
player does the same it puts one order

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.399 
player does the same it puts one order
of<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:02.009> robot<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.000> let's<00:02:03.450> say<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
of each robot so let's say when this for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.010 
of each robot so let's say when this for
what<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.680> wants<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> turn<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> only

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
what he wants to turn and with the only

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.429 
what he wants to turn and with the only
robots<00:02:07.380> he<00:02:07.560> wants<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.310> water

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
robots he wants to go for water

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.319 
robots he wants to go for water
then<00:02:11.439> I<00:02:11.709> reserved<00:02:12.220> programming<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.060> both

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
then I reserved programming for both

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.770 
then I reserved programming for both
robots<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:15.189> were<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.549> terms<00:02:15.909> and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
robots so these were about terms and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.899 
robots so these were about terms and
this<00:02:16.989> robot<00:02:17.230> goes<00:02:17.650> forward<00:02:18.159> two<00:02:18.519> hexes

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
this robot goes forward two hexes

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.490 
this robot goes forward two hexes
because<00:02:19.299> I<00:02:19.329> play<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.829> fast<00:02:20.829> forward<00:02:21.280> time

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
because I play the fast forward time

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.619 
because I play the fast forward time
this<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.860> end<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.280> first<00:02:24.459> one<00:02:24.819> now

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
this is the end of the first one now

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.470 
this is the end of the first one now
player<00:02:26.379> will<00:02:26.709> only<00:02:26.859> be<00:02:27.069> able<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.430> change<00:02:27.879> one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
player will only be able to change one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.679 
player will only be able to change one
instruction<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.500> either<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.909> robots<00:02:31.299> each

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
instruction on either of the robots each

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.220 
instruction on either of the robots each
term<00:02:32.109> so<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.310> blue<00:02:33.489> player<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> robot

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
term so the blue player has here a robot

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
term so the blue player has here a robot
which<00:02:35.409> is<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.980> middle<00:02:36.159> of<00:02:36.310> nothing<00:02:36.489> he<00:02:36.909> has

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
which is in the middle of nothing he has

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.399 
which is in the middle of nothing he has
robot<00:02:38.049> which<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.500> not<00:02:39.189> just<00:02:39.909> next<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> gem<00:02:40.840> so

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
robot which is not just next to a gem so

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.050 
robot which is not just next to a gem so
I<00:02:41.739> will<00:02:42.340> use<00:02:42.549> this<00:02:42.879> robot<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.250> ask<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.790> robot

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
I will use this robot and ask the robot

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.170 
I will use this robot and ask the robot
to<00:02:46.420> turn<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.200> face<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.470> chip<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:48.010> will<00:02:48.609> replace

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
to turn to face the chip I will replace

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.149 
to turn to face the chip I will replace
the<00:02:49.569> existing<00:02:49.750> order<00:02:50.290> by<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.069> turn<00:02:51.370> order<00:02:53.159> this

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
the existing order by a turn order this

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.979 
the existing order by a turn order this
is<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.430> only<00:02:54.489> change<00:02:54.849> i<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.209> make<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
is the only change i can make for the

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.339 
is the only change i can make for the
blue<00:02:56.139> player<00:02:56.409> so<00:02:56.829> now<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:58.090> would<00:02:58.299> be<00:02:58.480> executing

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
blue player so now it would be executing

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.039 
blue player so now it would be executing
both<00:02:59.650> programming<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.790> nothing<00:03:01.299> advanced

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
both programming so nothing advanced

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.190 
both programming so nothing advanced
nothing<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.099> then<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.489> other<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:03.720> turns<00:03:04.720> and

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
nothing and then the other one turns and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.349 
nothing and then the other one turns and
then<00:03:05.530> nothing<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.220> then<00:03:06.340> nothing<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.150> that's

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
then nothing and then nothing and that's

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.140 
then nothing and then nothing and that's
it<00:03:07.480> for<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:07.720> blue<00:03:07.930> player<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.489> yellow

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
it for the blue player now the yellow

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.960 
it for the blue player now the yellow
player<00:03:10.389> goes<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:11.439> know<00:03:11.590> player<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:12.760> robot

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
player goes you know player this robot

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.869 
player goes you know player this robot
will<00:03:13.329> turn<00:03:13.599> this<00:03:14.019> robot<00:03:14.410> will<00:03:14.769> go<00:03:15.370> fast<00:03:15.639> for<00:03:15.849> a

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
will turn this robot will go fast for a

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.379 
will turn this robot will go fast for a
while<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.840> want<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.859> have<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.190> robot<00:03:18.579> gets<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
while I want to have this robot gets the

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.809 
while I want to have this robot gets the
gem<00:03:19.629> which<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.019> there<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.370> will<00:03:21.639> leave<00:03:21.760> that

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
gem which is there so I will leave that

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.150 
gem which is there so I will leave that
robot<00:03:22.269> as<00:03:22.419> is<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.959> moment<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.949> will

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
robot as is for the moment and I will

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.220 
robot as is for the moment and I will
make<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.699> water<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:26.639> we<00:03:27.639> place<00:03:27.879> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
make this for water and we place the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.369 
make this for water and we place the
fast-forward<00:03:29.230> Lantern<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.780> execute<00:03:32.260> the

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
fast-forward Lantern then execute the

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.379 
fast-forward Lantern then execute the
programming<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:33.010> both<00:03:33.310> robots<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.180> one

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
programming of both robots so this one

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.939 
programming of both robots so this one
nothing<00:03:34.989> then<00:03:35.799> turns<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.329> nothing<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.109> this

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
nothing then turns then nothing and this

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.729 
nothing then turns then nothing and this
one<00:03:39.220> turns<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.150> nothing<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.750> nothing<00:03:40.930> now

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
one turns then nothing and nothing now

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.550 
one turns then nothing and nothing now
back<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.310> blue<00:03:42.549> planet<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.780> from<00:03:44.260> turn

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
back to the blue planet and so from turn

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.379 
back to the blue planet and so from turn
to<00:03:44.590> turn<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:45.489> will<00:03:45.669> be<00:03:45.790> able<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:46.090> borrow

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
to turn you will be able to borrow

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.839 
to turn you will be able to borrow
programming<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.859> will<00:03:48.010> be<00:03:48.190> able<00:03:48.549> to

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
programming but you will be able to

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.309 
programming but you will be able to
change<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.299> single<00:03:49.900> instruction<00:03:50.500> each<00:03:51.340> term

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
change a single instruction each term

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.050 
change a single instruction each term
this<00:03:53.319> is<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> close<00:03:53.859> up<00:03:53.889> of<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.699> robot

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
this is a close up of the robot

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.780 
this is a close up of the robot
programming<00:03:55.540> track<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.199> each<00:03:56.349> player<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:57.459> as

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
programming track for each player so as

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.969 
programming track for each player so as
you<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.090> see<00:03:58.359> each<00:03:58.659> robot<00:03:58.959> has<00:03:59.319> three<00:03:59.650> slots

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
you can see each robot has three slots

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.710 
you can see each robot has three slots
on<00:04:00.220> which<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.609> can<00:04:00.790> put<00:04:01.000> programming<00:04:01.449> types

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
on which you can put programming types

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.629 
on which you can put programming types
and<00:04:01.959> each<00:04:02.290> player<00:04:02.590> are<00:04:02.919> the<00:04:03.069> same<00:04:03.280> programming

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
and each player are the same programming

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.270 
and each player are the same programming
tires<00:04:03.970> available<00:04:04.290> advanced<00:04:05.290> ones<00:04:05.590> advance

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
to add a program in an empty slot or to

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.830 
to add a program in an empty slot or to
replace<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.590> program<00:04:59.280> from<00:05:00.000> Ascot<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.600> that

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
replace a program from Ascot in that

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.960 
replace a program from Ascot in that
case<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.380> other<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.770> was<00:05:01.980> there<00:05:02.280> comes<00:05:02.760> back

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
case the other that was there comes back

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.810 
case the other that was there comes back
to<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.270> player's<00:05:03.480> hand<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.920> third<00:05:05.130> option<00:05:05.280> is

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
to the player's hand the third option is

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.100 
to the player's hand the third option is
to<00:05:06.240> swap<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.920> programming<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:09.030> two<00:05:09.360> slots<00:05:09.660> you

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
to swap the programming of two slots you

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.990 
to swap the programming of two slots you
cannot<00:05:10.350> swap<00:05:10.620> from<00:05:10.830> one<00:05:11.310> robot<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.880> other

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
cannot swap from one robot to the other

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.390 
cannot swap from one robot to the other
but<00:05:12.300> if<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.350> have<00:05:13.470> something<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.980> this<00:05:14.130> I

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
but if I have something like this I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.980 
but if I have something like this I
could<00:05:15.000> swap<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.380> order<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.730> two<00:05:17.910> types<00:05:18.180> so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
could swap the order of the two types so

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.550 
could swap the order of the two types so
now<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.290> robot<00:05:19.740> advances<00:05:20.550> before<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.030> turns

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
now the robot advances before it turns

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.200 
now the robot advances before it turns
you<00:05:22.560> can<00:05:22.770> also<00:05:22.920> swap<00:05:23.280> these<00:05:23.490> two<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.030> can

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
you can also swap these two and you can

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.400 
you can also swap these two and you can
swap<00:05:24.620> another<00:05:25.620> tile<00:05:25.980> with<00:05:26.640> an<00:05:26.760> empty<00:05:26.970> slot

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
swap another tile with an empty slot

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.950 
swap another tile with an empty slot
making<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.770> way<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.940> last<00:05:30.090> option<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.720> to

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
making it this way the last option is to

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.860 
making it this way the last option is to
remove<00:05:31.260> one<00:05:31.710> or<00:05:31.950> all<00:05:32.370> types<00:05:32.940> from<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.360> robot<00:05:33.540> so

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
remove one or all types from a robot so

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.110 
remove one or all types from a robot so
I<00:05:34.050> can<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.500> remove<00:05:34.770> one<00:05:35.010> if<00:05:35.250> I<00:05:35.490> just<00:05:35.790> want<00:05:36.000> to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
I can just remove one if I just want to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.990 
I can just remove one if I just want to
remove<00:05:36.420> this<00:05:37.260> one<00:05:37.530> or<00:05:37.770> I<00:05:38.100> can<00:05:38.430> clear<00:05:38.670> up<00:05:38.700> the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
remove this one or I can clear up the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.300 
remove this one or I can clear up the
whole<00:05:39.180> programming<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:39.960> robot<00:05:40.220> it's<00:05:41.220> a

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
whole programming of that robot it's a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.160 
whole programming of that robot it's a
way<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.520> shut<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.940> down<00:05:41.970> when<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.990> situation

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
way to shut it down when the situation

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.470 
way to shut it down when the situation
is<00:05:43.710> really<00:05:44.340> really<00:05:44.670> bad<00:05:44.790> and<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.180> want<00:05:45.390> to

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
is really really bad and you want to

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.780 
is really really bad and you want to
make<00:05:45.630> sure<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.500> new<00:05:46.740> start<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:47.700> be

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
make sure to get a new start it can be

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.420 
make sure to get a new start it can be
useful<00:05:48.260> this<00:05:49.260> is<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.530> close<00:05:49.830> up<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:50.190> the

crystal<00:06:00.990> will<00:06:01.200> enter<00:06:01.440> play<00:06:01.650> at<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:02.070> center<00:06:02.430> of

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
crystal will enter play at the center of

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.760 
crystal will enter play at the center of
the<00:06:02.730> board<00:06:02.940> then<00:06:03.630> it<00:06:03.840> will<00:06:04.050> be<00:06:04.170> this<00:06:04.320> one<00:06:04.590> and

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
the board then it will be this one and

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.860 
the board then it will be this one and
this<00:06:04.890> one<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.160> this<00:06:05.340> one<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.030> on<00:06:06.060> as<00:06:06.660> you

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
this one and this one and so on as you

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.390 
this one and this one and so on as you
can<00:06:07.020> see<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.380> crystals<00:06:07.590> have<00:06:08.010> different

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
can see the crystals have different

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.300 
can see the crystals have different
shapes<00:06:08.610> and<00:06:08.820> values<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:10.290> blue<00:06:10.500> crystals<00:06:11.010> here

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
shapes and values the blue crystals here

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.760 
shapes and values the blue crystals here
have<00:06:12.240> two<00:06:12.450> jumps<00:06:12.780> on<00:06:12.900> them<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.320> they<00:06:13.710> are

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
have two jumps on them and they are

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.610 
have two jumps on them and they are
worth<00:06:13.980> two<00:06:14.250> points<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:15.630> green<00:06:15.840> crystals<00:06:16.350> have

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
worth two points the green crystals have

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.680 
worth two points the green crystals have
three<00:06:17.340> gems<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.880> they<00:06:18.060> are<00:06:18.180> worth<00:06:18.360> three

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
three gems and they are worth three

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.740 
three gems and they are worth three
points<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:20.040> purple<00:06:20.460> crystals<00:06:20.910> are<00:06:21.120> for<00:06:21.510> James

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
points the purple crystals are for James

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.370 
points the purple crystals are for James
and<00:06:21.990> there<00:06:22.350> were<00:06:22.530> four<00:06:22.950> points
