00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
take it away from me I know somebody

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.619

would before I can actually play the
system<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> included

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

headset<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.270> nicer<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
headset which is a lot nicer than the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
headset which is a lot nicer than the
one<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.080> came<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> Xbox<00:01:05.070> 360<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
one that came with the Xbox 360 so you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
one that came with the Xbox 360 so you
can<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.119> some<00:01:06.270> multiplayer<00:01:06.570> chat<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.830> also

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can do some multiplayer chat and also

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710 
can do some multiplayer chat and also
they<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.400> different<00:01:08.939> buttons<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> mute

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
they have different buttons for the mute

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
they have different buttons for the mute
and<00:01:09.900> turning<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> volume<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and turning the volume up and down so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.740 
and turning the volume up and down so
this<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.460> great<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.820> Skype<00:01:12.090> calls<00:01:12.390> or

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this would be great for Skype calls or

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.060 
this would be great for Skype calls or
anything<00:01:13.170> else<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> probably<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
anything else you probably want to be

using<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.780> some

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
using it for and then now we have some

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
using it for and then now we have some
cables<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> cable<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
cables there this is cable right here is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.990 
cables there this is cable right here is
actually<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> huge<00:01:18.960> power<00:01:19.710> brick<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
actually for the huge power brick the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
actually for the huge power brick the
power<00:01:21.240> stone<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:21.990> whatever<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> call

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
power stone or whatever you want to call

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.530 
power stone or whatever you want to call
it<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> pretty<00:01:23.970> big<00:01:24.270> thing<00:01:24.299> that's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it this is a pretty big thing that's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
it this is a pretty big thing that's
gonna<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.960> hopefully<00:01:25.680> sitting<00:01:25.950> behind<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
gonna be hopefully sitting behind your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
gonna be hopefully sitting behind your
entertainment<00:01:26.850> console<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> way<00:01:28.200> but

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
entertainment console out of the way but

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
entertainment console out of the way but
it's<00:01:28.619> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> huge<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> look

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it's kind of huge and if you take a look

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.230 
it's kind of huge and if you take a look
at<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> ps4<00:01:31.920> came<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.670> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
at the one that the ps4 came with you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
at the one that the ps4 came with you
see<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> slight<00:01:33.930> difference<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
see there's a slight difference with it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.940 
see there's a slight difference with it
because<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> ps4<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.290> actual<00:01:37.290> power<00:01:37.590> source

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because the ps4 the actual power source

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
because the ps4 the actual power source
is<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.159> internal<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.869> gonna

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
is actually internal so it's not gonna

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
is actually internal so it's not gonna
be<00:01:40.079> taking<00:01:40.320> any<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.560> space<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.430> living

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
be taking any more space in your living

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
be taking any more space in your living
room<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.000> again<00:01:42.329> more<00:01:42.810> than<00:01:42.840> likely<00:01:43.079> you're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
room but again more than likely you're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
room but again more than likely you're
not<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.500> ever<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.040> power<00:01:44.220> brick<00:01:44.430> once

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
not gonna ever see this power brick once

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.429 
not gonna ever see this power brick once
you<00:01:44.939> set<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> first<00:01:45.659> time<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you set it up for the first time so I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.469 
you set it up for the first time so I
don't<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:46.979> big<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.520> deal<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
don't think it's that big of a deal but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
don't think it's that big of a deal but
next<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.290> new<00:01:49.590> controller<00:01:50.040> which

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
next up we have the new controller which

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
next up we have the new controller which
has<00:01:50.250> been<00:01:50.549> fine-tuned<00:01:51.390> there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> lot<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
has been fine-tuned there's a lot of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.450 
has been fine-tuned there's a lot of
different<00:01:52.290> tweaks<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.619> Microsoft<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
different tweaks that Microsoft did to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
different tweaks that Microsoft did to
it<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> I'll<00:01:54.060> cover<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> those<00:01:54.899> things

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it and I'll cover some of those things

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
it and I'll cover some of those things
in<00:01:55.259> another<00:01:55.350> video<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> pretty<00:01:56.430> nice

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
in another video but it's a pretty nice

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
in another video but it's a pretty nice
looking<00:01:56.820> controller<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.630> when<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> actually

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
looking controller and when I actually

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.499 
looking controller and when I actually
put<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.159> hands<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> act<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
put it in my hands and act it and like I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
put it in my hands and act it and like I
was<00:02:00.630> simulating<00:02:01.110> gaming<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.130> had<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> nice

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
was simulating gaming it had a nice

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.429 
was simulating gaming it had a nice
little<00:02:02.909> grip<00:02:03.149> too<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> nice<00:02:03.540> field<00:02:03.810> toward<00:02:04.170> but

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
little grip too a nice field toward but

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.600 
little grip too a nice field toward but
there<00:02:04.619> were<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> couple<00:02:04.950> things<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.310> didn't

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
there were a couple things that I didn't

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.850 
there were a couple things that I didn't
like<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.180> I'll<00:02:06.270> cover<00:02:06.509> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
like about it and I'll cover that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
like about it and I'll cover that
another<00:02:07.130> video<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:07.880> now<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.090> last<00:02:08.390> cable<00:02:08.690> is

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
another video but now the last cable is

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.440 
another video but now the last cable is
going<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.200> be<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.470> HDMI<00:02:10.250> cable<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.940> next<00:02:11.330> up

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
going to be the HDMI cable and next up

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.020 
going to be the HDMI cable and next up
is<00:02:11.570> going<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.170> new<00:02:12.380> Kinect<00:02:12.950> 2.0<00:02:13.820> this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
is going to be the new Kinect 2.0 this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.450 
is going to be the new Kinect 2.0 this
is<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> main<00:02:14.570> reason<00:02:14.840> why<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.680> Xbox<00:02:16.220> one

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
is the main reason why the Xbox one

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.240 
is the main reason why the Xbox one
costs<00:02:16.940> $100<00:02:17.540> more<00:02:17.780> than<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> ps4<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.950> this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
costs $100 more than the ps4 but this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.620 
costs $100 more than the ps4 but this
Kinect<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.700> way<00:02:20.000> better<00:02:20.270> than<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> first

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
Kinect is way better than the first

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.720 
Kinect is way better than the first
generation<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.410> gonna<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.680> able<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.250> mean<00:02:22.610> it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
generation is gonna be able to I mean it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.430

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.830 
to see that the ps4 has an overall
smaller<00:03:57.950> profile<00:03:58.549> but<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.180> longer<00:03:59.600> from

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
smaller profile but it is longer from

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.750 
smaller profile but it is longer from
the<00:04:00.019> front<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.530> back<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.310> does<00:04:01.549> have

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
the front to the back but it does have

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.340 
the front to the back but it does have
the<00:04:01.880> advantage<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.330> be<00:04:02.480> able<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.750> sit<00:04:03.079> upright

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
the advantage to be able to sit upright

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.410 
the advantage to be able to sit upright
so<00:04:03.980> dependent<00:04:04.400> on<00:04:04.430> your<00:04:04.579> entertainment<00:04:05.000> setup

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
so dependent on your entertainment setup

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.940 
so dependent on your entertainment setup
I<00:04:05.570> can<00:04:05.870> actually<00:04:05.989> sit<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.320> upright<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.680> could

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
I can actually sit it upright and could

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.410 
I can actually sit it upright and could
take<00:04:07.070> up<00:04:07.250> less<00:04:07.519> space<00:04:07.549> in<00:04:08.000> your<00:04:08.090> certain

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
take up less space in your certain

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.940 
take up less space in your certain
situation<00:04:09.019> but<00:04:09.260> for<00:04:09.320> me<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.560> know<00:04:09.709> I'm<00:04:09.799> probably

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
situation but for me I know I'm probably

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.039 
situation but for me I know I'm probably
not<00:04:10.220> gonna<00:04:10.370> move<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.760> Xbox<00:04:11.269> one<00:04:11.510> ever<00:04:11.780> unless

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
not gonna move this Xbox one ever unless

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.440 
not gonna move this Xbox one ever unless
I<00:04:12.410> actually<00:04:12.590> move<00:04:13.040> places<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:13.730> I'm<00:04:14.090> not<00:04:14.239> really

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
I actually move places so I'm not really

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.060 
I actually move places so I'm not really
too<00:04:14.540> turned<00:04:14.930> off<00:04:15.110> by<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.319> way<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.709> looks<00:04:15.920> and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
too turned off by the way it looks and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.620 
too turned off by the way it looks and
the<00:04:16.130> size<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.729> it<00:04:16.849> and<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.239> could<00:04:17.390> be<00:04:17.510> different

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the size of it and it could be different

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.360 
the size of it and it could be different
from<00:04:17.840> others<00:04:18.169> but<00:04:18.349> I<00:04:18.410> think<00:04:18.620> overall<00:04:18.950> this

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
from others but I think overall this

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.280 
from others but I think overall this
Xbox<00:04:19.699> one<00:04:19.940> it's<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.389> decent-looking<00:04:20.780> system

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
Xbox one it's a decent-looking system

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.900 
Xbox one it's a decent-looking system
it's<00:04:21.470> pretty<00:04:21.590> big<00:04:21.919> has<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.340> power<00:04:22.520> brick<00:04:22.760> has

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
it's pretty big has the power brick has

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.760 
it's pretty big has the power brick has
a<00:04:22.940> lot<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.240> stuff<00:04:23.389> going<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.139> I<00:04:24.380> think

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
a lot of stuff going with it but I think

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.230 
a lot of stuff going with it but I think
we<00:04:24.949> have<00:04:25.190> some<00:04:25.370> potential<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.030> good

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
we have some potential to be a good

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.640 
we have some potential to be a good
system<00:04:26.570> overall<00:04:26.930> you're<00:04:27.260> not<00:04:27.350> gonna<00:04:27.500> be

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
system overall you're not gonna be

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.439 
system overall you're not gonna be
testing<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.430> stay<00:04:28.639> tuned<00:04:28.850> for<00:04:29.150> more
