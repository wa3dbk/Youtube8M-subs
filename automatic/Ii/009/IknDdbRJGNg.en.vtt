the Oscar De La Hoya fight you know I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
the Oscar De La Hoya fight you know I
did<00:00:24.480> predict<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.109> he<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.439> defeat<00:00:25.740> Oscar

but<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.580> never<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.119> million<00:00:27.330> years<00:00:27.510> thought

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
but I never in a million years thought

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.160 
but I never in a million years thought
that<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.289> would<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.680> one-sided<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:30.359> mean<00:00:31.140> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that it would be that one-sided I mean I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.340 
that it would be that one-sided I mean I
don't<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.610> deny<00:00:33.350> many

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to get that WBO title so I mean you look

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.380 
to get that WBO title so I mean you look
at<00:01:17.040> what's<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.060> think

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
at what's going on out there I think

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
at what's going on out there I think
people<00:01:18.570> definitely<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.860> him<00:01:20.070> make

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
people definitely want to see him make

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
people definitely want to see him make
history<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.799> should

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
history and I don't think that he should

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.700 
history and I don't think that he should
be<00:01:23.130> denied<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> comes

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
be denied that right now when it comes

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.429 
be denied that right now when it comes
to<00:01:26.250> who<00:01:26.700> wins<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.360> acts<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.900> fight<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to who wins the acts you will fight I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
to who wins the acts you will fight I
think<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.280> totally<00:01:29.729> different

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
think that's a totally different

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
think that's a totally different
argument<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.070> when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> think<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
argument because when you think about it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.630 
argument because when you think about it
Manny<00:01:33.720> Pacquiao<00:01:34.229> has<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.950> through<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> lot<00:01:35.430> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
people don't think about it this way but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.910 
people don't think about it this way but
this<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> first<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.350> he

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this would be the first time that he

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
this would be the first time that he

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
see the mayweather fight I don't know

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
see the mayweather fight I don't know
for<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> fact<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.489> will<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:38.940> them<00:02:39.030> Mayweather

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
for a fact that will get them Mayweather

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
for a fact that will get them Mayweather
fight<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.870> negotiations<00:02:40.709> would<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:41.040> pretty

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
fight the negotiations would be pretty

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.699 
fight the negotiations would be pretty
tough<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.300> with<00:02:42.600> or<00:02:42.810> without<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.320> mayweather

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
tough but with or without the mayweather

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.860 
tough but with or without the mayweather
fight<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> one<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.700> history<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.570> yes

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
fight this is the one for history so yes

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
fight this is the one for history so yes
I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> belt<00:02:47.070> should<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.519> up<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.880> grabs

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
I think the belt should be up for grabs

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.259 
I think the belt should be up for grabs
and<00:02:48.450> secondly<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:50.010> think<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.580> Pacquiao

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
and secondly I do think that Pacquiao

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.590 
and secondly I do think that Pacquiao
has<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.510> very<00:02:51.840> good<00:02:51.900> chance<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.560> win<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:54.180> far<00:02:54.570> as

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
has a very good chance to win as far as

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.050 
has a very good chance to win as far as
how<00:02:54.900> he<00:02:54.959> goes<00:02:55.350> about<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.610> will<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.880> very

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
how he goes about that that will be very

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060 
how he goes about that that will be very
difficult<00:02:57.390> from<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.019> strategic<00:02:58.200> standpoint

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
difficult from a strategic standpoint

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.330 
difficult from a strategic standpoint
for<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> simple<00:03:00.480> fact<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.980> know<00:03:02.010> when

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.550 
you look at the guys who beat Miguel
Cotto<00:03:04.980> or<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.360> guy<00:03:06.630> which<00:03:07.079> was<00:03:07.110> Antonio

Cotto or the one guy which was Antonio

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.350 
Cotto or the one guy which was Antonio
Margarito<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.549> he<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:08.760> big<00:03:09.000> enough<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
Margarito but he was big enough to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360 
Margarito but he was big enough to
impose<00:03:09.810> his<00:03:10.079> will<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.650> he<00:03:11.010> took<00:03:11.190> everything

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
so I think it's a lot on it you know a

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.930 
so I think it's a lot on it you know a
lot<00:04:18.470> hanging<00:04:18.829> in<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.040> balance<00:04:19.190> in<00:04:19.579> this<00:04:19.669> fight

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
I'm looking forward to it and I think it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.600
