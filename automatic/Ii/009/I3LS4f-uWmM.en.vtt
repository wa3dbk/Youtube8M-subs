00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.499 

once<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.190> base<00:01:03.339> is<00:01:03.519> dried<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.969> used<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.330> matte

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509

I<00:01:09.200> shaded<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.410> my<00:01:10.530> temples<00:01:10.980> underneath<00:01:11.610> my

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I shaded in my temples underneath my

I shaded in my temples underneath my
cheekbones<00:01:12.030> around<00:01:12.750> my<00:01:13.080> jaw<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.800> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cheekbones around my jaw and then a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:26.690 
cheekbones around my jaw and then a
little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.370> around<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.760> forehead<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> nose

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.070 

then<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.790> swap<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.180> small<00:01:28.510> brush<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
then I swap to a small brush and I

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.660 
then I swap to a small brush and I
applied<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.650> eyeshadow<00:01:30.040> around<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.460> grille

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
applied the eyeshadow around the grille

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.590 
applied the eyeshadow around the grille
to<00:01:30.700> try<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.090> make<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.330> look<00:01:31.420> more

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
to try and make it look more

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:48.600 
to try and make it look more
three-dimensional

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.359 

and<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:50.229> lastly<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.680> use<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.250> eye<00:01:51.280> shadow

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
and then lastly I use the eye shadow

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.340 
and then lastly I use the eye shadow
around<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.090> sockets<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.900> blended<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
around my sockets and I blended the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:11.410 
around my sockets and I blended the
color<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:53.830> towards<00:01:54.220> my<00:01:54.369> eyes

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.020 

for<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> bit<00:02:12.590> more<00:02:12.770> definition<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.580> added<00:02:13.910> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
for a bit more definition I added a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.670 
for a bit more definition I added a
small<00:02:14.180> amount<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.690> black<00:02:14.900> face<00:02:15.110> paint<00:02:15.319> along

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
small amount of black face paint along

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.589 
small amount of black face paint along
the<00:02:15.800> outside<00:02:16.220> edge<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.730> socket<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.239> I

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
the outside edge of the socket and I

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.350 
the outside edge of the socket and I
blended<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.050> into<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.440> eyeshadow<00:02:22.000> each<00:02:23.000> mask

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
blended it into the eyeshadow each mask

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.390 
blended it into the eyeshadow each mask
has<00:02:23.630> its<00:02:23.810> own<00:02:23.989> unique<00:02:24.290> set<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.590> engravings

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
has its own unique set of engravings

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.160 
has its own unique set of engravings
now<00:02:25.790> I'll<00:02:25.940> loosely<00:02:26.360> based<00:02:26.510> mine<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
now I'll loosely based mine on the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.050 
now I'll loosely based mine on the
pattern<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.470> Bellatrix<00:02:28.040> has<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.640> added

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pattern that Bellatrix has but I added

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.059 
pattern that Bellatrix has but I added
in<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.300> lot<00:02:29.480> more<00:02:29.510> teardrops<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.860> can

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
in a lot more teardrops now you can

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.530 
in a lot more teardrops now you can
paint<00:02:31.250> whatever<00:02:31.580> design<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.120> around

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
paint whatever design you like around

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.270 
paint whatever design you like around
your<00:02:32.750> mask<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:33.770> need<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.980> try<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
your mask but you do need to try and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.890 
your mask but you do need to try and
keep<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.610> symmetrical<00:02:35.180> which<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.660> quite

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
keep it symmetrical which can be quite

00:02:35.900 --> 00:03:31.990 
keep it symmetrical which can be quite
tricky

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.420 

to<00:03:32.960> try<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.260> make<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.560> engravings<00:03:34.040> appear

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
to try and make the engravings appear

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.130 
to try and make the engravings appear
itched<00:03:34.640> into<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> mask<00:03:35.330> rather<00:03:35.720> than<00:03:35.990> just

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
itched into the mask rather than just

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.820 
itched into the mask rather than just
painted<00:03:36.500> on

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
painted on

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.800 
painted on
I<00:03:36.860> went<00:03:37.370> over<00:03:37.610> each<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.090> black<00:03:38.270> lines<00:03:38.510> in

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
I went over each of the black lines in

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:59.350 
I went over each of the black lines in
the<00:03:38.930> same<00:03:39.140> silver<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.770> used<00:03:40.010> for<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.280> base

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.440 

and<00:03:59.950> then<00:04:00.950> finally<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.520> just<00:04:01.550> painted<00:04:02.120> my<00:04:02.150> neck

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450
