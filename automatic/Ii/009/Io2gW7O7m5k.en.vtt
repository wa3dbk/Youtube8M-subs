00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.760

 bailly is doing pretty well huh he 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.380
 know he's frustrating a bit because he 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 put a few folds but hey it'll come 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.009
 it'll come after the turns the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.350
 pitching then that's the convincing the trial 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.850
 his basic positions both feet 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.740
 taken off the exit costs 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.520
 and there I put my eyes and I'm going 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.520
 engage the shoulders 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.270
 station so how does he manage our 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.100
 biker one of the goalies he's good 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:21.020
 in general and bikers make good 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:21.890
 Tuvalu mountain bikers do lift the nose 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.720
 whore 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.060
 you'll have direction it's like a 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 motorcycle when you see the end of October and play 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.459
 can turn she 'll go straight 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 okay following the look we will stop 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.640
 that motorcycle is the rule of thumb 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.610
 to say when we are in the bend 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.959
 we have to watch the next turn for 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.959
 have the best possible trajectory
