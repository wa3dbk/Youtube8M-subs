00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 sony has been updating its line of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 smartphones with models of the most 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.039
 various types 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
 xperia t2 is treated or is one of the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.810
 bets from the company to the consumer 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 want an elegant cell phone with a screen 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 huge 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.710
 hardware configurations are good 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.450
 the camera is of high quality and gives 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.239
 use two chips 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 with these resources and other 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 sony hopes to conquer the galley that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 likes a high-end handset 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 but did she do the duty 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 From home 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 we were impressed when we took the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.379
 destroy up to 2 in hands similar design 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 with the two is something that does not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.579
 we expected 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 Although this phone is giant, it is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.000
 light and thin and very elegant 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 the back ends up registering all 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.580
 the digital 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.820
 but this is a detail that gives 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820
 relieve 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.149
 the great highlight is literally the screen 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.579
 It's six inches for games. 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.570
 and enjoy everything that android has to 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.539
 to offer 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.159
 the color and brightness of the screen are 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.310
 excellent 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.229
 the balance between brightness and contrast is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.340
 balanced and the images are 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.920
 reproduced with color fidelity 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.689
 the big display is good for those who like 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.950
 to watch movies on mobile 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.560
 but the resolution does not help much is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 720p and ends up showing some pixels the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.929
 which is bad for those who seek quality 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.179
 a problem that may appear in the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.610
 handle with one hand but you can 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.119
 compensate part of this with a double touch 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.340
 in the home icon this shortcut pulls the menu 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.619
 notifications for the bottom of the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.310
 and provides easy access to some 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.069
 settings the overall experience with the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.069
 product is satisfactory but do not expect a 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.530
 fantastic performance the hardware is good 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.040
 but the small amount of ram 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.040
 ends up disrupting the result is that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.079
 traces appear in the animations a delay 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.269
 handsome happens in loading 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.680
 of the widgets and you end up frustrating 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.630
 when I tried to go very heavy apps 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.870
 the small amount of space for 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.690
 save apps games also disrupts 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.389
 xperia up to 2 has 8 GB of memory 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.829
 storage, only four gigabytes are 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.560
 available 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.430
 part of the problem is the apps and games that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.850
 installed and can not be removed 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.319
 The worst thing is having me for speed shift. 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.319
 installed but can only play twice 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.660
 good when it comes to playing games 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:09.049
 this sony until it makes beautiful we got 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.810
 play me in xvii and batman without problems 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.500
 performance is not great but the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.019
 device did not choke the camera 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.329
 td 2 is one of the strengths with 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.299
 ability to record photos up to 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:28.160
 13 megapixels and record full HD videos 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.690
 it can be useful at all times the flash 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.450
 breaks a branch and the settings 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.599
 generates beautiful photos 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.879
 the same differential is the smart mode 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.220
 which has a lot of filters 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.340
 they serve to embellish the image with 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.190
 butterflies dinosaurs and fishes 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.870
 this augmented reality business is 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.239
 really cool really 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.220
 even to simulate the lens effect 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.870
 special and a photographer's 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.810
 the team's partnership until 2 in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.540
 impressive even using wifi and 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.540
 leaving the screen on for a long time 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.390
 the battery lasts easily one day 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.849
 sony's special features also help 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.829
 guaranteeing a little time of energy 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.829
 when the charge level is low 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.230
 xperia t2 is not all that 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.720
 We expected it but it is a device that 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.500
 It goes very well for day to day 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.170
 the gigantic screen is good offering color 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.810
 vibrant and good level of brightness but 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.720
 reasonable resolution is something that could 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.970
 improve in an upcoming version since 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.600
 there is no point in having too much room for 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.610
 accommodate the system and not have quality 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.640
 the lack of ram and a small 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.650
 space to install apps and games are the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.320
 worst problems 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.090
 luckily this sony has a good camera 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.770
 and battery that compensate some slips 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.170
 costing one thousand and three hundred reais 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.000
 we believe this is not the best 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.080
 option for anyone who wants a smartphone 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.690
 big guy 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.060
 anyway you need to evaluate 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.250
 the specifications of the product and see 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.340
 it offers what you need 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.660
 also check the analysis in tek world and 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.660
