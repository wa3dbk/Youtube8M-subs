00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.169 
relatively quick and that's done so the
next<00:01:43.300> thing<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:44.050> need<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:46.030> can

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
next thing that we need to do is you can

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.050 
next thing that we need to do is you can
get<00:01:46.300> rid<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.690> toner<00:01:47.380> box<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.979> open<00:01:48.940> up<00:01:49.000> a

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
get rid of the toner box and open up a

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.490 
get rid of the toner box and open up a
file<00:01:49.270> manager<00:01:49.630> which<00:01:49.780> will<00:01:49.899> be<00:01:49.990> able<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.229> find

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
file manager which will be able to find

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830 
file manager which will be able to find
in<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.490> bottom<00:01:51.910> left<00:01:52.090> corner<00:01:52.179> of<00:01:52.479> your<00:01:52.780> screen

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
in the bottom left corner of your screen

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.609 
in the bottom left corner of your screen
we<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.800> see<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:53.979> on<00:01:54.099> my<00:01:54.369> camera<00:01:54.610> angle<00:01:55.030> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
we have to see it on my camera angle and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.639 
we have to see it on my camera angle and
find<00:01:56.619> where<00:01:56.920> you've<00:01:57.069> downloaded<00:01:57.599> your<00:01:58.649> file

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
find where you've downloaded your file

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.290 
find where you've downloaded your file
so<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.340> see<00:02:00.610> mines<00:02:00.819> here

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
so I can see mines here

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.880 
so I can see mines here
minecraft<00:02:01.989> PI<00:02:02.489> 0<00:02:03.489> 1<00:02:04.380> tar.gz

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.359 
minecraft PI 0 1 tar.gz
and<00:02:06.099> so<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.149> is<00:02:07.300> zipped<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.069> need<00:02:09.220> to

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
and so this is zipped so we can need to

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.110 
and so this is zipped so we can need to
extract<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.330> right<00:02:10.599> click<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.400> click<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.610> X

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
called Minecraft pi and that's how we're

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.849 
called Minecraft pi and that's how we're
going<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.569> actually<00:03:44.019> actually<00:03:44.290> launch<00:03:44.739> the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.229 

that's<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.590> dot<00:03:53.859> slash<00:03:54.250> minecraft<00:03:54.790> PI<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
that's just a dot slash minecraft PI and

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.379 
that's just a dot slash minecraft PI and
press<00:03:55.690> Enter

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
press Enter

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:04.530 
press Enter
you'll<00:03:58.389> then<00:03:58.419> see<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:59.019> box<00:04:00.010> appear<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:04.000> try<00:04:04.209> it

you'll then see a box appear just try it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.240 
you'll then see a box appear just try it
move<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.319> you<00:04:05.349> can<00:04:05.530> see<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.250> with

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
move it so you can see it like this with
