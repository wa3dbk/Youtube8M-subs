gun and now you're shooting behind them
as<00:02:59.239> they<00:02:59.299> run<00:03:00.019> up<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> field<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.980> want<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.190> sit

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
as they run up the field you want to sit

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.160 
as they run up the field you want to sit
there<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:02.060> put<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.390> stream<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.840> front<00:03:03.110> of

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
there and put the stream in front of

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
there and put the stream in front of
them<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.470> let<00:03:03.620> them<00:03:03.709> run<00:03:03.950> into<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:04.970> get

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
them and let them run into it so you get

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.360 
them and let them run into it so you get
here<00:03:05.410> put<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.500> string<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.769> front<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
here put the string in front of it and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.160 
here put the string in front of it and
let<00:03:07.850> them<00:03:07.970> run<00:03:08.150> into<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.630> um<00:03:09.130> also<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.840> want<00:03:12.049> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
let them run into it um also you want to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.240 
let them run into it um also you want to
pick<00:03:12.440> spots<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.730> aren't<00:03:14.030> too<00:03:14.840> far<00:03:15.230> away<00:03:15.380> from

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
pick spots that aren't too far away from

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.850 
pick spots that aren't too far away from
off<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.360> brake<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:17.720> they're<00:03:18.260> not<00:03:18.380> too<00:03:18.590> close

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
off the brake and they're not too close

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.039 
off the brake and they're not too close
either<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.880> know<00:03:19.970> if<00:03:20.090> you're<00:03:20.450> trying<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.780> lane

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
either you know if you're trying to lane

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.030 
either you know if you're trying to lane
like<00:03:21.890> say<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.100> instance<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.519> can<00:03:23.680> well<00:03:24.680> it's

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
like say for instance that can well it's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.009 
like say for instance that can well it's
only<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> take<00:03:25.459> them<00:03:25.880> maybe<00:03:26.600> three

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
only going to take them maybe three

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.780 
only going to take them maybe three
steps<00:03:27.350> in<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.650> behind<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:28.070> can<00:03:28.370> most

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
steps in there behind that can most

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.099 
steps in there behind that can most
likely<00:03:28.940> you're<00:03:29.359> not<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.780> able<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
likely you're not going to be able to

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.860 
likely you're not going to be able to
get<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.590> stream<00:03:30.980> over<00:03:31.400> there<00:03:31.579> in<00:03:31.820> time<00:03:32.630> before

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
get a stream over there in time before

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.180 
get a stream over there in time before
they<00:03:33.079> disappear<00:03:33.440> behind<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.829> can<00:03:34.010> it's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
they disappear behind that can it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.470 
they disappear behind that can it's
gonna<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.000> they're<00:03:35.090> already<00:03:35.269> behind

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
gonna be go and they're already behind

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.880 
gonna be go and they're already behind
the<00:03:35.660> cam<00:03:35.840> there's<00:03:36.350> no<00:03:36.410> way<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.620> don't<00:03:36.829> even

the cam there's no way you don't even

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.949 
the cam there's no way you don't even
try<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.160> lean<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.519> even<00:03:38.209> between<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.750> can

try to lean that even between the can
and<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> rocket<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:41.049> that's<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.260> little<00:03:42.560> bit

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
and the rocket that that's a little bit

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.560 
and the rocket that that's a little bit
better<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:43.880> you're<00:03:44.030> going<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.269> be<00:03:44.329> pretty

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
better but you're going to be pretty

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.300 
better but you're going to be pretty
good<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.930> order<00:03:45.109> to<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.350> in<00:03:45.500> between<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.980> can

good in order to get in between that can

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.910 
good in order to get in between that can
and<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:47.120> rocket<00:03:47.630> another<00:03:48.260> good<00:03:48.530> Lane<00:03:48.739> would

and that rocket another good Lane would

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.190 
and that rocket another good Lane would
be<00:03:49.420> say<00:03:50.420> for<00:03:50.570> instance<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.930> know<00:03:50.959> that

they've got they've got a really fast
aggressive<00:03:53.209> snake<00:03:53.660> player<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.410> know<00:03:54.590> they're

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
aggressive snake player you know they're

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.020 
aggressive snake player you know they're
gonna<00:03:54.859> try<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.190> go<00:03:55.310> into<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.640> snake<00:03:55.700> they

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
gonna try to go into the snake they

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.030 
gonna try to go into the snake they
always<00:03:56.390> go<00:03:56.510> into<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.810> snake<00:03:56.870> right<00:03:57.709> here<00:03:57.769> in

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
always go into the snake right here in

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.340 
always go into the snake right here in
between<00:03:58.280> these<00:03:58.519> two<00:03:58.730> cans<00:03:59.060> there's<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.079> nice

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
between these two cans there's a nice

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.650 
between these two cans there's a nice
little<00:04:00.590> stream<00:04:01.010> right<00:04:01.190> there<00:04:01.400> now<00:04:01.700> as<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.540> move

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
little stream right there now as I move

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
little stream right there now as I move
up<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.049> bunker<00:04:03.290> that's<00:04:03.470> going<00:04:03.620> to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
up to the bunker that's going to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.830 
up to the bunker that's going to
disappear<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.370> if<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.850> want<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.180> try<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.390> lane

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
disappear so if I want to try to lane

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.539 
disappear so if I want to try to lane
there<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.200> better<00:04:06.620> get<00:04:06.769> down<00:04:06.890> as<00:04:07.069> low<00:04:07.340> as

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
there I better get down as low as

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.220 
there I better get down as low as
possible<00:04:07.609> to<00:04:08.239> try<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.510> take<00:04:08.630> advantage<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.140> as

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
possible to try and take advantage of as

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.660 
possible to try and take advantage of as
much<00:04:09.410> cover<00:04:09.680> from<00:04:09.859> this<00:04:10.010> little<00:04:10.250> burrito<00:04:10.519> as

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
much cover from this little burrito as

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.099 
much cover from this little burrito as
possible<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.239> may<00:04:11.450> even<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.870> start

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
possible so I may even have to start

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.470 
possible so I may even have to start
down<00:04:12.260> here<00:04:12.470> on<00:04:12.590> my<00:04:12.650> knees<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.120> try<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.299> get

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
down here on my knees just to try to get

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.409 
down here on my knees just to try to get
as<00:04:14.600> much<00:04:14.810> cover<00:04:15.170> as<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.920> possibly<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:17.000> order

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
as much cover as I possibly can in order

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.409 
as much cover as I possibly can in order
to<00:04:17.539> hit<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.959> stream<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:19.130> hit<00:04:19.639> him<00:04:19.820> both<00:04:20.000> as<00:04:20.209> he

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
to hit this stream to hit him both as he

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.129 
to hit this stream to hit him both as he
goes<00:04:20.630> through<00:04:20.660> it

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
goes through it

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.770 
goes through it
now<00:04:22.039> I'm<00:04:22.160> gonna<00:04:22.370> eventually<00:04:22.940> probably<00:04:23.479> after

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
now I'm gonna eventually probably after

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.090 
now I'm gonna eventually probably after
about<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.110> first<00:04:24.350> three<00:04:24.590> seconds<00:04:24.889> I'm<00:04:24.979> going

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
about the first three seconds I'm going

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
about the first three seconds I'm going
to<00:04:25.190> definitely<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.700> get<00:04:25.820> into<00:04:25.970> home<00:04:26.270> but

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
to definitely have to get into home but

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.930 
to definitely have to get into home but
at<00:04:27.050> least<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.560> little<00:04:28.039> bit<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.159> cover<00:04:28.580> if

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
at least I have a little bit of cover if

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.470 
at least I have a little bit of cover if
I<00:04:29.360> kneel<00:04:29.630> down<00:04:29.870> right<00:04:29.930> away

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
I kneel down right away

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.800 
I kneel down right away
from<00:04:31.080> maybe<00:04:31.320> at<00:04:31.470> least<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.800> Doritos<00:04:32.250> side<00:04:32.810> so

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
from maybe at least the Doritos side so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.990 
from maybe at least the Doritos side so
right<00:04:34.050> off<00:04:34.080> break<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.860> start<00:04:35.520> laying<00:04:35.670> laying

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
right off break I start laying laying

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.880 
right off break I start laying laying
Laney<00:04:36.240> Laney<00:04:36.360> all<00:04:36.840> right<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.290> miss<00:04:37.470> them<00:04:37.680> so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
Laney Laney all right so I miss them so

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.060 
Laney Laney all right so I miss them so
I<00:04:38.280> get<00:04:38.460> up<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.790> then<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.210> get<00:04:39.390> into<00:04:39.570> my<00:04:39.690> bunker

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
I get up and then I get into my bunker

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.190 
I get up and then I get into my bunker
so<00:04:41.070> laning<00:04:42.000> mostly<00:04:42.600> takes<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.870> little<00:04:42.960> bit<00:04:43.110> of

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
so laning mostly takes a little bit of

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.410 
so laning mostly takes a little bit of
practice<00:04:43.460> try<00:04:44.460> using<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.000> cheater<00:04:45.210> ball

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420
