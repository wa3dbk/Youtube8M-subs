00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello you love nils here today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.460
 again with a vegetarian recipe 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.170
 just like his vegan today 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.530
 family draws you out of this is a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.160
 relatively large volume but pretty much 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.580
 low calorie and nice protein content 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 okay you see the ingredients 100 sick 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 this soy cube 500 grams of flowers 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.890
 Coal would be a medium sized zucchini 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.270
 I say so around 150 grams 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.700
 then to the spices there I would 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.670
 recommend a bio vegetable broth 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 garlic is either fresh or smog 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 always very cool for the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.510
 vegetarian and vegan cuisine 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 I actually learned to love it 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.789
 really a must have in my life 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.270
 Kitchen simply brings that novel 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.280
 the picture just opens up a bit 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.770
 with salt and pepper and who owns it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.019
 The hot peppers are a bit sharper here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.060
 so a bit these are now medium 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210
 sheep but if you are there from an intel 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 he already has a neat fit in it 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 Okay, that will be easy 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 Hanover and yes I hope you have fun 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.090
 Let's go yes, step number one completely 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.450
 I just got the 100 grams of the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 weighed soy cube and so about five 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 gram bio made it earlier about that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 Whole over now with fresh up 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 Boiled water where all this good once 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.100
 covered where I'm a little bit more 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 The thumbs are sure to be full 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270
 yes, let's leave ten now 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.049
 minutes I think the whole always 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.820
 still off with the lid and then have 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.350
 First of all, we do not work ten 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 minutes to stand in between times 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.780
 maybe a little pump through 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.260
 all a bit this condiment abkriegt 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 and can suck pretty nice 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.400
 and now comes the next step yes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.930
 next step you see that goes here 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 very quickly zack zack 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.580
 you see them here the broccoli with a 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.880
 a little bit of water poured over something 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.350
 organic beer powder is not extremely much 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.780
 water 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:18.680
 we do something quite simply plate 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.569
 if the whole cooks so cooks 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 make a plate that you have since 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.310
 medium cook that so it cooks through and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.280
 then five minutes is enough 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.890
 The thing still has a bit to and after 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.269
 could the third step people in the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.360
 time where now the soya dice 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.069
 pull through and the cauliflower on the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.150
 plate is now cooking for five minutes 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.160
 can we ever go to the zuglinie 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 Of course, take it once before rinse off 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.620
 and cut his time into rough dice 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.050
 because in the end it does not matter if 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.000
 the rough cut is everything 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.160
 clear 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.989
 yes so that the vki now has five 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.239
 minutes at a relatively high level 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.250
 properly cooked five minutes 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.260
 now it's crisp through now 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.360
 a little bit of liquid in there 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.820
 We turn the temperature up now 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.579
 Medium and now we go to the zucchini 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.340
 to really it is enough if the rough 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.340
 are cut 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 okay that is bucket for the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.040
 accusations 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.510
 they are now ten minutes pulled 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.390
 pull it out for two minutes longer 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.340
 no topic okay the whole on middle 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.690
 I would now like that again 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.459
 five minutes away 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.660
 let stew from time to time 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.660
 and done 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.230
 You see, I have all this with me now 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.610
 poured a little water 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.530
 These five minutes together 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.870
 simmer is over the plate now 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.430
 Turned down a bit and again 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.590
 as I said all this once 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.689
 bit is covered with water once 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.359
 poured a little bio again 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.129
 powder afterwards and ever such a 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.250
 Schutzweg will like it that way 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.430
 about five to seven grams drug like that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.750
 ours are soy cube here 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.480
 drained off so easily 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.769
 squeezed out why easily I want 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.450
 Of course not that complete 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.950
 So then are dry which should 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.780
 keep still a little juice 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.769
 So I am personally there now 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.090
 such a small tempo is pure of course 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.239
 matter of taste because the bring for it 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.889
 neatly sharp with it so there is 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.210
 there is still a small shot here 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.090
 So I would say for the whole 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.550
 recipe we are so in the 310 grams 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.919
 about a bit has already in the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.900
 So I'm looking for soup 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.470
 now a bit garlic camera that 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.780
 is of course up to you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.280
 how much and what you like in there right now 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.949
 in such things, of course, offer 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.820
 Somehow salt smoke is liquid 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:51.690
 soy sauce salt and pepper in general 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.560
 steak for barbecue is gyros spice 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.159
 So what worked in the mincemeat 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.690
 direction 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:00.490
 I like it that way today and yes the whole thing 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.409
 I'm going through a bit and now 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.380
 let it be so easy minutes and 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.550
 it's time for heavy 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.699
 gadget nonsense 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.520
 Of course this is optimal with this 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.470
 a wandmixer is the best variant 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.860
 for that and we touch it all once 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.860
 by 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.349
 yes the whole thing is cured now 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.849
 I'm sure a few more 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.439
 be bigger pieces inside each 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.779
 on how ever that may not if 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.039
 then you do a little bit more 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.289
 creamier and finer so now I give 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.279
 just here my soya cubes are the ones 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.499
 so much through now 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.080
 drawn in the look it will be tomorrow 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:54.639
 I give the chili and the kowitz now 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.979
 Simply and in the reason it was that 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.389
 already and we'll see you soon 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.369
 try and serve 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.050
 nutritional values 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:04.319
 the whole is done and it sees 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.599
 really great 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:11.079
 I've just been a little bit with 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:13.149
 paprika spice topped I'd say 

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:16.629
 not only tastes good but sees 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:19.929
 even in the contrast very well 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:22.809
 yes it is our zucchini cauliflower 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:26.289
 soup nice with a calm protein 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:28.809
 filling due to the soja's come whole 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.939
 By the way, easy to nourish for 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:32.139
 those who are new here are coming 

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:36.009
 every now and then new ones 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:39.070
 i am using the fdp this is one 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.500
 Dates were where you all 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.420
 Food is very present 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.650
 easy to track the calories and 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.010
 is also very fast 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.100
 So for this recipe or 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:55.270
 have this dish in all the crowd 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.020
 we have 439 calories 41 grams of carbs 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:02.110
 4 grams fat so very loud and 550 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.260
 protein and as I said that 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.600
 ratio calories to protein that 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.920
 Speaks naturally bendel is a good one 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.060
 Satisfied and suitable for every diet 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.780

 times best with her nice little dumplings 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.710
 quite clearly the liquid smog that brings 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.060
 Of course, that will of course bring 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.180
 spice you rank it so hard 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.810
 really gets it right yummy
