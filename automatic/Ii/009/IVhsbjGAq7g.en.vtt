in<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.570> very<00:00:45.780> tactile<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.670> once<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> solve

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
in this very tactile and once you solve

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
in this very tactile and once you solve
the<00:00:48.059> puzzle<00:00:48.420> tasting<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> know

the puzzle tasting that I want to know
something<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.980> takes<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> long<00:00:50.610> time<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
something it takes me a long time to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.840 
something it takes me a long time to
solve<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> I've<00:00:51.600> never<00:00:51.750> saw<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.440> myself

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
solve that I've never saw one but myself

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.100

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
seconds I got an unsolvable information

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
seconds I got an unsolvable information
ok<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.369> wait<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> singing<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
ok so wait is that singing that is that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.109 
ok so wait is that singing that is that
it's<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> different<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it's just different so no I want to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's just different so no I want to
solve<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.420> some<00:01:18.689> wondrous<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> lie

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
solve them some wondrous to lie

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
solve them some wondrous to lie
superhero<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:19.830> blue<00:01:19.950> ok<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.689> go
