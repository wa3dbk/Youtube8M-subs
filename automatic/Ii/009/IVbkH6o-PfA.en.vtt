 these skills to imitate memorize 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.100
 and ordering you also serve to 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.900
 defend yourself from the daily chaos to 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.850
 orient yourself in a society with too much 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.260
 information and to put a little bit of 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.330
 logic in everything that surrounds them 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.940
 the autism spectrum disorder is not 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.790
 an illness 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.380
 it is a different form of development and 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.080
 to help them with the difficulties that 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.570
 that entails we should give them some time their 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.060
 measure a space where they sit 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.850
 happy and calm because everything is in 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.950
 a logical order and a shared way 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.080
 to communicate trying not to give them 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.860
 too many stimuli at the same time so that 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.069
 do not end up disconnecting 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.159
 people with tea are more skilled than 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.689
 we in some things see and feel 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.150
 in the world in a different way to the 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.520
 our who are with them 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.819
 we must listen to them and try 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.969
 understand them but above all do that 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:30.389
 feel loved that is all the 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.389
 secret
