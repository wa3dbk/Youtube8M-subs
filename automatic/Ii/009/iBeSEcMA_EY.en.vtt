00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.000
 graph world 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.940
 the Japanese version of the game jar did not hang out with 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 released on the prefix famicom in 1990 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.259
 year developed such 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.150
 and released by sans company 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 interesting that probably chal hoped 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 on the universe terminators of the original 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.630
 1984 movie 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 but during the development of franchise rights 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 were lost as a result of which we 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 got another game with no less 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 original universe franchisee 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.109
 terminator as it should be we got 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 this is wretchedness 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 but the one who played will understand me but 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.950
 developed and strengthened the unspoken rules on 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.329
 every good movie should go 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 disgusting game what do we have in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 as a result, the world has got its own 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 own independent plot and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 heroes though post-apocalyptic 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 post-war seating with no cars 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.789
 leaves us throughout the game 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 what is the first level worth 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.820
 the ruins of the city â€‹â€‹and endless 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.530
 mechanized foe 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.300
 and the last boss turned out to be 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 metal skeleton that how would we 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 hints however the game does not cause 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 no complaints in terms of pictures or 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 control in it all that only 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 required for a good game 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 but in this game there is another 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.250
 the component which is necessary 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 pay attention and this music is music in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 this game is simply divine as she 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.650
 good at my logical 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 context so with technological 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 side and sound tracks in 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 raw world advantageous distinguishes the background 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 most games coming out on consoles 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.930
 family name 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 Ines games published sans for these 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 consoles have always been given special 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 reverent attitude to music 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.430
 design and why am I the whole thing 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 I tell yes, I just wrote down the server 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.369
 all one of the best music themes of this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.049
 games and I would like to and their curves 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.049
 little hands on play go 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.410
 and
