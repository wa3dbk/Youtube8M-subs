00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 Goodwood Festival of Speed ​​2014 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.000
 The worldwide debut of the new Focus ST 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 I think the original Stig is at the wheel of this car. 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
 This will be fun 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600
 this is the Ford Focus ST ... 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.400
 ... but we do something special. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 We take a seat behind the wheel of this car 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 but his opponent will take the course on a computer game. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.500
 This is our gamer. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 On the Ford platform 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200
 With a view of the virtual road and ... 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 live in the car. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.759
 It is a race to the top of the hill. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.800
 If I understand correctly, it was the virtual driver 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
 in the advantage. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 But let's just wait ... 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 If the real car, which is currently at the forefront, 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.520
 first to reach the end of the double right turn 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.210
 and then going to the second part of the turn both in the car and in the game they are now there 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 they are now coming out of that bend ... 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.300
 and who will ride under the bridge first? 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.900
 It's the car 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.400
 who currently gets it from the gamer. 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.100
 Again the view of the virtual road I mentioned earlier ... 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.800
 we approach Malcom on the steep slope and in the bend 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.600
 Quite a few garage boxes along the road for our NASCARs from just now. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.500
 The car is at the front and is now ahead of Malcom as it sets course for the flint wall. 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.670
 That is a very quick and narrow one 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.600
 short turn to the right and left, where you must not hit the wall, while you have to watch out for the hay on the other side. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200
 It must be really perfect. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 And currently the car is still ahead. 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.000
 Despite the long right-hand turn where the sun hinders him. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.200
 In the long left turn 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.100
 to finish like this ... 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 and the car makes a sigh from the gamer. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.000
 The new Focus ST 1.05: 13 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.300
 GT6 Focus 1.05: 23 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.300
 That was really tight. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 Kazunori Yamauchi 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.300
 Inventor of the Gran Turismo games 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 Jim Farley 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.400
 Executive VP at Ford Motor Company 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.000
