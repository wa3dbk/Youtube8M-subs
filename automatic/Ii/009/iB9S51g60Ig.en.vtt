Python and a hatchling

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
Python and a hatchling
tub<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.410> year's<00:00:25.680> babies<00:00:27.320> what

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
tub it's one of this year's babies what

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.240 
tub it's one of this year's babies what
we'll<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.760> up<00:00:29.760> off<00:00:30.439> get<00:00:31.439> reversed<00:00:31.769> we'll<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
we'll do up off get reversed we'll use a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.130 
we'll do up off get reversed we'll use a
hook<00:00:32.520> basically<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> use<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> hook<00:00:34.020> because

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
hook basically I use a hook because

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.850 
hook basically I use a hook because
there's<00:00:34.500> no<00:00:34.620> heat<00:00:34.860> signature<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> hook

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
there's no heat signature from the hook

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.709 
there's no heat signature from the hook
they're<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.820> sensitive<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> heat

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
they're very very sensitive to heat

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.459 
they're very very sensitive to heat
signature<00:00:41.059> very<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.329> prone<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> giving<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
signature very very prone to giving you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590 
signature very very prone to giving you
a<00:00:43.500> nip<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.700> doesn't<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.059> hurt<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.510> they

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a nip it doesn't really hurt when they

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
a nip it doesn't really hurt when they
bite<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.280> actually

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
bite but when they do you can actually

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
bite but when they do you can actually
cause<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> snake<00:00:48.270> quite<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> lot<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> damage

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
cause the snake quite a lot of damage

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
cause the snake quite a lot of damage
and<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.739> clip<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> snake<00:00:50.340> out

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and all I do is clip the snake out

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
and all I do is clip the snake out
somewhere<00:00:51.210> close<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.660> head<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
somewhere close to the head so that it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.069 
somewhere close to the head so that it
can<00:00:53.640> climb<00:00:53.879> encourages<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> client

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
can climb encourages it to client

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
can climb encourages it to client
actually<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> hook<00:00:55.680> we'll<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually on the hook we'll take the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.450 
actually on the hook we'll take the
snake<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> tub<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.949> manner<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
snake out of the tub in this manner and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.180 
snake out of the tub in this manner and
then<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.649> I'll<00:01:01.770> show<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
then and then I'll show you how to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.820 
then and then I'll show you how to
handle<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.690> oK<00:01:03.690> we've<00:01:03.899> got<00:01:03.960> our<00:01:04.199> baby<00:01:04.379> jungle

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
caused quite a bit of damage but it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.030 
caused quite a bit of damage but it's
also<00:01:45.659> picking<00:01:46.050> up<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> vibrations<00:01:46.860> through

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
also picking up the vibrations through

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
also picking up the vibrations through
my<00:01:47.220> body<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.580> me<00:01:47.700> speaking<00:01:47.940> as<00:01:48.330> well<00:01:52.280> these

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
my body of me speaking as well these

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
my body of me speaking as well these
babies<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.170> haven't<00:01:55.170> been<00:01:55.229> handled<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.740> at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
babies they haven't been handled much at

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:12.480 
babies they haven't been handled much at
all<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.470> they're<00:01:58.680> fairly<00:01:59.220> fairly<00:02:00.119> wild

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:31.120 

guy<00:02:13.390> was<00:02:13.600> telling<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> get<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.050> bit<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.320> trust

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.920 

if<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.850> notice<00:02:32.210> that<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.450> actually<00:02:32.570> come<00:02:32.900> from

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
if you notice that I actually come from

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.630 
if you notice that I actually come from
below<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.620> well<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.070> actually<00:02:34.130> take<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
below as well and actually take the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.850 
below as well and actually take the
snake<00:02:34.880> out<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.480> don't<00:02:36.230> want<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.410> actually<00:02:36.530> come

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
snake out I don't want to actually come

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.590 
snake out I don't want to actually come
from<00:02:36.890> above<00:02:40.120> predators<00:02:41.120> will<00:02:41.300> come<00:02:41.450> from

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
from above predators will come from

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200 
from above predators will come from
above<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:43.430> important<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.910> come<00:02:44.090> from

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
above so it's important to come from

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:58.259 
above so it's important to come from
below

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.330 

I<00:02:58.299> see<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> lot<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.140> people<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.560> YouTube<00:02:59.590> wearing

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
I see a lot of people on YouTube wearing

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.569 
I see a lot of people on YouTube wearing
gloves<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.860> these<00:03:02.860> kind<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.220> things<00:03:03.489> to

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
gloves and these kind of things to

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.229 
gloves and these kind of things to
handle<00:03:03.819> these<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.640> really<00:03:06.939> don't<00:03:07.090> need

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
handle these and you really don't need

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.649 
handle these and you really don't need
to<00:03:07.319> mean<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:11.640> they<00:03:12.640> will<00:03:12.849> tame<00:03:13.120> down<00:03:13.299> fairly

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
to mean they they will tame down fairly

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.220 
to mean they they will tame down fairly
quickly<00:03:14.819> they<00:03:15.819> will<00:03:16.000> remain<00:03:16.299> took<00:03:16.659> defenses

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
quickly they will remain took defenses

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.039 
quickly they will remain took defenses
for<00:03:17.470> well<00:03:17.980> quite<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> while<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:21.700> if<00:03:22.689> you<00:03:22.840> give

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
for well quite a while but if you give

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.660 
for well quite a while but if you give
them<00:03:23.079> five<00:03:23.379> minutes<00:03:23.709> ten<00:03:23.920> minutes<00:03:24.189> a<00:03:24.280> day<00:03:24.430> of
