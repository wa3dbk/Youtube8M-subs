00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fought here but I think that we saw a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.230 
fought here but I think that we saw a
commitment<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.350> an<00:01:44.770> attitude<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.520> rebuild

and<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.960> grow<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.650> so<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.280> put<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:48.580> in

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
and to grow and so if you put that in

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.210 
and to grow and so if you put that in
context<00:01:49.360> with<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.840> recent<00:01:50.350> recession<00:01:50.470> this
