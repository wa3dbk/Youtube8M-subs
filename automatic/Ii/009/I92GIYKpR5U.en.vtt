lovely freaking art for this website and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.740 
lovely freaking art for this website and
the<00:01:18.509> fact<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.860> almost<00:01:20.479> neopets<00:01:21.479> like

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the fact that for almost neopets like

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.120 
the fact that for almost neopets like
copy<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.220> fun<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
copy is actually pretty fun but the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.999 
copy is actually pretty fun but the
minuses<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> game<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.409> well<00:01:28.409> yet

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
minuses about the game is that well yet

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
minuses about the game is that well yet
again<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> small<00:01:30.390> most<00:01:30.600> tech<00:01:30.930> space<00:01:31.200> game

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
again it's a small most tech space game

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
again it's a small most tech space game
so<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.430> exactly<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.270> fun<00:01:33.600> after<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> long

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
so it's not exactly to fun after a long

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.249 
so it's not exactly to fun after a long
while<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.950> uh<00:01:38.820> there's<00:01:39.689> mini<00:01:39.990> games

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
while and you know uh there's mini games

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
while and you know uh there's mini games
and<00:01:40.560> stuff<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.159> after<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> long<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:42.060> they

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and stuff but after a long time they

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.380 
and stuff but after a long time they
probably<00:01:42.899> will<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.500> boring<00:01:44.090> since<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
probably will get boring since like I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
probably will get boring since like I
said<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.990> neopets<00:01:46.470> game<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.829> almost

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
said it is a neopets game it's almost

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
said it is a neopets game it's almost
like<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> routine<00:01:47.700> rather<00:01:48.030> thing<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.750> that's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like a routine rather thing so that's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
like a routine rather thing so that's
the<00:01:49.710> problem<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.700> overall<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the problem with that but overall it's a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
the problem with that but overall it's a
good<00:01:51.869> game<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:52.409> try<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.829> put<00:01:53.070> the

to every player let's see the leveling

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.870 
to every player let's see the leveling
up<00:07:03.810> is<00:07:04.020> actually<00:07:04.560> kind<00:07:04.950> of<00:07:05.070> hard<00:07:05.310> it<00:07:05.520> takes<00:07:05.670> a

while that's probably a downside to the
scam<00:07:08.970> is<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.420> amount<00:07:09.660> of<00:07:09.840> time<00:07:10.050> that<00:07:10.080> it<00:07:10.260> takes

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
scam is the amount of time that it takes

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.710 
scam is the amount of time that it takes
to<00:07:10.650> level<00:07:11.010> up<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.370> the<00:07:11.970> community<00:07:12.510> the
