00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
doing I've been looking at the original

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.559 
doing I've been looking at the original
vision<00:02:09.780> which<00:02:10.110> God<00:02:10.380> gave<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> me<00:02:11.569> everything

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
vision which God gave to me everything

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.510 
vision which God gave to me everything
that<00:02:12.750> God<00:02:12.930> told<00:02:13.260> me<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.739> everywhere<00:02:14.310> he

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that God told me to do everywhere he

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.460 
that God told me to do everywhere he

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
told me to preach all the revelation

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.199 
told me to preach all the revelation
that<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.709> told<00:02:16.890> me<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.220> write<00:02:17.459> I'm<00:02:17.700> looking<00:02:18.090> at

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
that he told me to write I'm looking at

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.720 
that he told me to write I'm looking at
the<00:02:18.360> original<00:02:18.630> vision<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:20.069> when<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> look<00:02:20.610> at

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the original vision but when I look at

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.370 
the original vision but when I look at
the<00:02:20.850> other<00:02:21.030> page<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.480> look<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.050> what<00:02:22.230> I've

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the other page and look at what I've

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.760 
the other page and look at what I've
really<00:02:22.890> done<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.870> there's<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> difference

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
really done I see there's a difference

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.700 
really done I see there's a difference
between<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.390> fallen<00:02:27.750> short<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
between the two I have fallen short of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.640 
between the two I have fallen short of
the<00:02:28.920> original<00:02:29.460> vision<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.120> can't<00:02:31.080> check<00:02:31.410> out

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
the original vision I can't check out

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.330 
the original vision I can't check out
yet

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
yet

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
yet
I<00:02:32.370> can't<00:02:32.790> leave<00:02:33.120> when<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.810> look<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
I can't leave when I look at the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
I can't leave when I look at the
original<00:02:35.010> vision

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
original vision

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.090 
original vision
I<00:02:35.610> count<00:02:36.300> not<00:02:36.660> myself<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.650> apprehended

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
I count not myself to have apprehended

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.810 
I count not myself to have apprehended
these<00:02:38.700> two<00:02:39.060> pages<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.990> match<00:02:40.320> my<00:02:40.680> job<00:02:41.520> is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
these two pages don't match my job is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.400 
these two pages don't match my job is
not<00:02:42.180> finished<00:02:42.650> yet<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:45.140> really<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
not finished yet and that really is the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.150 
not finished yet and that really is the
reason<00:02:46.590> Paul<00:02:47.250> knew<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.350> time<00:02:49.710> for<00:02:49.740> him

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
reason Paul knew it was not time for him

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.240 
reason Paul knew it was not time for him
to<00:02:50.340> depart<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.940> life<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:52.020> assignment<00:02:52.740> was

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to depart this life the assignment was

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.500 
to depart this life the assignment was
not<00:02:53.670> complete<00:02:55.550> now<00:02:56.550> look<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.910> what<00:02:57.060> God<00:02:57.240> gave

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
not complete now look at what God gave

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.140 
not complete now look at what God gave
you<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:59.430> those<00:02:59.520> moments<00:02:59.790> when

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
you to do and in those moments when

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.910 
you to do and in those moments when
you're<00:03:00.300> tempted<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.870> despair<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.590> wonder

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
you're tempted to despair and you wonder

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.160 
you're tempted to despair and you wonder
if<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:03.420> need<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.750> look<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
if it's all over you need to look at the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.080 
if it's all over you need to look at the
original<00:03:04.650> vision<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.400> look<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.880> your

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
original vision and then look at your

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.750 
original vision and then look at your
accomplishments<00:03:07.190> if<00:03:08.190> you've<00:03:08.490> done

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
accomplishments if you've done

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.700 
accomplishments if you've done
everything<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.450> God<00:03:09.600> told<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.110> do<00:03:10.350> God's

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
everything that God told you to do God's

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.650 
everything that God told you to do God's
never<00:03:10.980> told<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.460> anything<00:03:11.670> else<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.270> do<00:03:12.420> maybe

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
never told you anything else to do maybe

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
never told you anything else to do maybe
your<00:03:12.930> assignments<00:03:13.530> finished<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.250> is

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
your assignments finished but that is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.240 
your assignments finished but that is
very<00:03:14.700> doubtful<00:03:15.440> when<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.470> look<00:03:16.770> at<00:03:16.890> what<00:03:17.040> God

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
very doubtful when I look at what God

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.760 
very doubtful when I look at what God
told<00:03:17.490> me<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.850> do<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.390> what<00:03:18.660> I've<00:03:18.810> done<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
told me to do and what I've done it

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.410 
told me to do and what I've done it
doesn't<00:03:20.130> matter<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.520> I've<00:03:20.640> done<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.910> lot<00:03:21.120> that's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
doesn't matter if I've done a lot that's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.990 
doesn't matter if I've done a lot that's
not<00:03:21.600> how<00:03:21.780> God<00:03:21.960> judges<00:03:22.470> me<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:23.580> doesn't<00:03:23.790> matter

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
not how God judges me it doesn't matter

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.810 
not how God judges me it doesn't matter
if<00:03:24.210> I've<00:03:24.300> done<00:03:24.510> more<00:03:24.750> than<00:03:24.900> somebody<00:03:25.140> else

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
if I've done more than somebody else

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.130 
if I've done more than somebody else
God's<00:03:26.820> not<00:03:27.060> talking<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.570> me<00:03:27.690> about<00:03:27.780> other

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
God's not talking to me about other

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.960 
God's not talking to me about other
people<00:03:28.560> he's<00:03:28.740> talking<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.220> me<00:03:29.250> about<00:03:29.580> me<00:03:29.820> and
