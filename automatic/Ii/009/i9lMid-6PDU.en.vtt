00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
all right we can go between those two

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.079 
all right we can go between those two
cars<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.830> first<00:00:21.099> car<00:00:21.369> you<00:00:21.400> come<00:00:21.699> to<00:00:21.910> that's

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089 
cars the first car you come to that's

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.239 
cars the first car you come to that's
the<00:00:22.269> blue<00:00:22.480> Toyota<00:00:23.349> Yaris<00:00:23.560> whatever<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.130> is

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249 
the blue Toyota Yaris whatever that is

the blue Toyota Yaris whatever that is
that's<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:25.150> car<00:00:25.359> that<00:00:25.539> we're<00:00:25.689> using<00:00:25.839> as<00:00:26.079> our

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
that's the car that we're using as our

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.200 
that's the car that we're using as our
reference<00:00:26.499> car<00:00:27.159> all<00:00:27.519> right<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:27.880> let's<00:00:28.060> move

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
reference car all right so let's move

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.640 
reference car all right so let's move
forward<00:00:28.269> and<00:00:28.869> we'll<00:00:29.079> talk<00:00:29.259> about<00:00:29.409> that

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
forward and we'll talk about that

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.960 
forward and we'll talk about that
reference<00:00:30.009> as<00:00:30.130> we<00:00:30.249> get<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.400> little<00:00:30.519> closer<00:00:30.730> to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
reference as we get a little closer to

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.050 
reference as we get a little closer to
it<00:00:31.680> all<00:00:32.680> right<00:00:32.980> now<00:00:33.250> you<00:00:33.310> slow<00:00:33.640> down<00:00:33.850> a<00:00:33.910> little

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
it all right now you slow down a little

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.900 
it all right now you slow down a little
bit<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.480> stop<00:00:34.810> right<00:00:35.440> about<00:00:35.620> there<00:00:36.250> perfect

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
bit and stop right about there perfect

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.310 
bit and stop right about there perfect
so<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.449> reference<00:00:37.719> point<00:00:38.020> that<00:00:38.079> we're

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
so the reference point that we're

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.830 
so the reference point that we're
looking<00:00:38.440> at<00:00:38.739> folks<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.879> point<00:00:40.420> where<00:00:40.660> the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
looking at folks is the point where the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.410 
looking at folks is the point where the
right<00:00:41.379> corner<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.489> bumper<00:00:42.969> of<00:00:43.000> that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420

right corner of the bumper of that
vehicle<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:44.370> lined<00:00:45.370> up<00:00:45.550> with<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:46.239> top<00:00:46.539> center

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
vehicle is lined up with the top center

vehicle is lined up with the top center
of<00:00:47.170> your<00:00:47.289> sideview<00:00:47.620> mirror<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.370> here<00:00:48.760> I'll

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
of your sideview mirror and here I'll

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.880 
of your sideview mirror and here I'll
show<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.179> picture<00:00:49.359> of<00:00:49.539> it<00:00:49.859> isn't<00:00:50.859> that

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
show you a picture of it isn't that

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.479 
show you a picture of it isn't that
beautiful

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
beautiful

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
very good so that's the reference point

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.150 
very good so that's the reference point
now<00:00:54.329> Angela<00:00:55.329> from<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.230> position<00:00:56.649> it's<00:00:56.829> just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
look straight through the space go ahead

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.630 
look straight through the space go ahead
and<00:01:02.559> turn<00:01:02.679> you're<00:01:02.949> at<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.129> turning<00:01:03.399> point

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
and turn you're at the turning point

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.640 
and turn you're at the turning point
that's<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:04.750> not<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.019> contemplative

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
that's right it's not the contemplative

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.650 
that's right it's not the contemplative
point<00:01:06.010> it's<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.250> turning<00:01:06.610> point<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:07.150> now<00:01:07.600> you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
point it's a turning point and now you

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.940 
point it's a turning point and now you
turn<00:01:08.020> back<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.409> other<00:01:08.439> way

mm-hmm keep looking straight one more
turn<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:16.180> your<00:01:16.299> right<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:16.990> perfect

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
turn to your right and it's perfect

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.580 
turn to your right and it's perfect
almost<00:01:18.009> one<00:01:18.490> more<00:01:18.670> turn<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:20.020> there<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
almost one more turn right there and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.670 
almost one more turn right there and
stop<00:01:21.090> perfect<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.630> stopping<00:01:22.930> position

stop perfect and the stopping position

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.760 
stop perfect and the stopping position
is<00:01:23.829> when<00:01:24.399> your<00:01:25.030> shoulder<00:01:25.509> is<00:01:25.689> across<00:01:26.259> from<00:01:26.619> the
