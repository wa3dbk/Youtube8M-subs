the<00:00:03.120> gold<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.510> started<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> make<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.110> new<00:00:04.319> demo

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
the gold we started to make the new demo

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.650 
the gold we started to make the new demo
was<00:00:04.830> just<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.220> make<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.640> fastest<00:00:06.270> downhill

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
was just to make the fastest downhill

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.240 
was just to make the fastest downhill
bike<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.020> we've<00:00:07.200> ever<00:00:07.350> come<00:00:07.589> up<00:00:07.740> with<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.130> we

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
bike that we've ever come up with so we

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.850 
bike that we've ever come up with so we
wanted<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.730> lower<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> center<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> gravity

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
wanted to lower the center of gravity

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.259 
wanted to lower the center of gravity
increases<00:00:10.860> capability<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.880> terms<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
increases capability in terms of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.299 
increases capability in terms of
handling<00:00:12.420> make<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> lighter<00:00:13.559> pedal<00:00:14.130> better

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
handling make a lighter pedal better

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.250 
handling make a lighter pedal better
everything<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.389> could<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.020> threw

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
everything we could think of we threw

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.470 
everything we could think of we threw
out<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.650> bike

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.490 

it<00:00:20.480> doesn't<00:00:20.689> look<00:00:20.810> like<00:00:20.840> any<00:00:21.170> other<00:00:21.320> bike

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
it doesn't look like any other bike

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.080 
it doesn't look like any other bike
that's<00:00:21.740> really<00:00:22.070> ever<00:00:22.220> been<00:00:22.400> made<00:00:22.670> it's<00:00:22.880> got

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
that's really ever been made it's got

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.810 
that's really ever been made it's got
some<00:00:23.269> unique<00:00:23.539> things<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:24.400> was<00:00:25.400> like<00:00:25.580> there's

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
some unique things I was like there's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.150 
some unique things I was like there's
the<00:00:26.060> trickiest<00:00:26.539> bike<00:00:26.779> I've<00:00:26.930> ever<00:00:27.020> seen<00:00:27.320> it's

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
the trickiest bike I've ever seen it's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.979 
the trickiest bike I've ever seen it's
gonna<00:00:28.550> definitely<00:00:28.849> open<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:29.419> lot<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.689> people's

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
gonna definitely open a lot of people's

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.460 
gonna definitely open a lot of people's
eyes<00:00:31.270> it's<00:00:32.270> got<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.449> whole<00:00:32.780> new<00:00:32.960> look<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.290> feel

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
eyes it's got a whole new look and feel

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.110 
eyes it's got a whole new look and feel
to<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:33.980> your<00:00:34.129> main<00:00:34.280> bike

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.580 

we<00:00:42.120> knew<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.600> gonna<00:00:42.720> be<00:00:42.899> difficult<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we knew it was gonna be difficult to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.530 
we knew it was gonna be difficult to
make<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> bike<00:00:44.100> lighter<00:00:44.460> while<00:00:45.180> maintaining

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
make the bike lighter while maintaining

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.840 
make the bike lighter while maintaining
the<00:00:45.960> stiffness<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.190> control<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> we've

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the stiffness and the control that we've

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
the stiffness and the control that we've
had<00:00:48.000> before<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.870> took<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.320> long<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
had before so it took a long time but

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.939 
had before so it took a long time but
the<00:00:50.670> engineers<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> design<00:00:52.079> team<00:00:52.110> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the engineers and the design team really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
the engineers and the design team really
got<00:00:53.100> down<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.370> work<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> worked<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.269> lot<00:00:54.449> with

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
got down to work and worked a lot with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.549 
got down to work and worked a lot with
the<00:00:54.780> athletes<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:56.220> big<00:00:56.489> enough<00:00:56.610> stick<00:00:57.559> be

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the athletes that's big enough stick be

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.020 
the athletes that's big enough stick be
a<00:00:58.589> good<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.610> for<00:00:59.760> tests<00:00:59.970> on<00:01:00.180> building

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
a good one for tests on building

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
a good one for tests on building
downhill<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.480> getting<00:01:04.259> people<00:01:04.350> excited

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
downhill is about getting people excited

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
downhill is about getting people excited
man<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.580> should<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.540> like

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
man which it should all be about like

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.680 
man which it should all be about like
melting<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.040> course<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> new<00:01:08.880> fastest<00:01:09.450> times

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
melting the course and new fastest times

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.450 
melting the course and new fastest times
and<00:01:10.050> doing<00:01:10.289> things<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.680> never<00:01:10.890> been<00:01:11.250> done

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and doing things that never been done

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.279 
and doing things that never been done
before<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:11.910> when<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:12.360> look<00:01:12.539> at<00:01:12.690> this<00:01:12.810> bike<00:01:13.050> it

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
before so when you look at this bike it

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.050 
before so when you look at this bike it
should<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.979> fired<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.850> grab<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
should just get you fired up to grab a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.109 
should just get you fired up to grab a
helmet<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> go

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.999 

handling<00:01:25.869> was<00:01:26.079> there's<00:01:26.439> a<00:01:26.500> couple<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.890> things

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
handling was there's a couple of things

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.260 
handling was there's a couple of things
that'll<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.399> different<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:28.000> one's

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
that'll be different this one's

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.870 
that'll be different this one's
rear-ends<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.079> lot<00:01:29.229> lighter<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.670> being

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
rear-ends a lot lighter with it being

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.029 
rear-ends a lot lighter with it being
lighter<00:01:31.149> it's<00:01:31.630> like<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.780> pump<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.740> out<00:01:32.890> of

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
lighter it's like a pump in and out of

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.240 
lighter it's like a pump in and out of
the<00:01:33.219> holes<00:01:33.490> no<00:01:34.119> smoother<00:01:34.630> boxes<00:01:35.259> this<00:01:36.009> new

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the holes no smoother boxes this new

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.800 
the holes no smoother boxes this new
bikes<00:01:36.490> definitely<00:01:36.909> got<00:01:37.030> potential<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.689> go<00:01:37.780> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
bikes definitely got potential to go a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:52.100 
bikes definitely got potential to go a
lot<00:01:38.020> faster<00:01:38.229> than<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.649> other

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950 

pretty<00:01:52.770> crazy<00:01:52.920> -<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:53.550> guess<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> first<00:01:54.150> rideable

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
pretty crazy - I guess a first rideable

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.360 
pretty crazy - I guess a first rideable
version<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.440> bike<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:55.980> pretty<00:01:56.190> much

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
version of a bike and it's pretty much

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.620 
version of a bike and it's pretty much
already<00:01:56.580> styled

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.450 

it's<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.320> crazy<00:02:04.500> how<00:02:04.680> good<00:02:05.010> at<00:02:05.100> handles

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it's pretty crazy how good at handles

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's pretty crazy how good at handles
that's<00:02:05.610> probably<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> thing<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.180> noticed<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's probably the thing I noticed the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
that's probably the thing I noticed the
most<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.290> soon<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.619> jumped<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.250> how

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
most as soon as I jumped on it was how

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
most as soon as I jumped on it was how
quick<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.030> change<00:02:09.360> directions<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.140> how

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
quick you can change directions and how

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
quick you can change directions and how
hard<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.069> slam<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.700> turns<00:02:12.170> so

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
hard you can slam it and it turns so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.750 
hard you can slam it and it turns so
really<00:02:13.440> lively<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.489> when<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.640> get

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
really lively like but then when you get

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.520 
really lively like but then when you get
it<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> bumps<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.840> eats<00:02:16.050> him<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.290> really

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it in the bumps it eats him up really

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.180 
it in the bumps it eats him up really
good

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.950 

we've<00:02:20.190> been<00:02:20.370> dedicated<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.090> down<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.600> racing

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
we've been dedicated to down and racing

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.920 
we've been dedicated to down and racing
for<00:02:22.260> almost<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.340> decades<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:24.180> continue<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
for almost two decades we continue to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.590 
for almost two decades we continue to
push<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> limits<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.800> carbon<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.460> fs<00:02:27.420> our

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
push the limits in carbon and fs our

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.320 
push the limits in carbon and fs our
design<00:02:28.020> from<00:02:28.590> geometry<00:02:28.920> we're<00:02:29.730> always<00:02:30.000> paying

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
design from geometry we're always paying

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.960 
design from geometry we're always paying
attention<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.140> looking<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.340> every

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
attention and looking to get every

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.790 
attention and looking to get every
millisecond<00:02:33.690> out<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.930> these<00:02:34.020> bikes<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.590> we're

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
millisecond out of these bikes and we're

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.040 
millisecond out of these bikes and we're
just<00:02:34.980> into<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.820> love<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.270> ride<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.480> love<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
just into it we love to ride and love to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.300 
just into it we love to ride and love to
it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.350 

it's<00:02:44.490> kind<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> best<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.210> both<00:02:45.240> worlds

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's kind of the best of both worlds

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.850 
it's kind of the best of both worlds
it's<00:02:45.900> kind<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.290> were<00:02:46.440> really<00:02:46.620> working

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
it's kind of what we were really working

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.710 
it's kind of what we were really working
towards<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> fast<00:02:48.180> bike<00:02:48.450> but

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
towards you know you get a fast bike but

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600 
towards you know you get a fast bike but
one<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.020> will<00:02:49.140> also<00:02:49.470> take<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> big<00:02:50.070> hits<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
one that will also take the big hits and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.400 
one that will also take the big hits and
yeah<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.150> we've<00:02:51.480> nailed<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.470
