00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.580
 I'm going to show the start-up of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.580
 a hoe motorcycle as well as its benefits 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 for this demonstration we have 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.329
 You can find this hoe bike in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 the electricity market or like this one 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.919
 gasoline will be a very useful tool 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.369
 to break or eliminate weeds from 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.369
 your garden 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.840
 for this demonstration we will need 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 unleaded petrol 95 oil mono 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 30 degrees helmets glasses and gloves 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.379
 Hoe bike is a tool that we 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.940
 will allow to plow or eliminate 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.280
 weeds that we have in our 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.440
 garden for it is equipped with a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.159
 set of blades that will get us 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.289
 facilitate this work 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.499
 we will also find hoes of 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.630
 electric that are lighter and that we 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.060
 will allow work on land 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.729
 smaller and motorized gasoline 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.330
 that will allow us to do jobs in 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.390
 larger surfaces 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 depending on the work surface 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.010
 we will find motoazadas with a greater or 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.750
 lower blade working width the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.600
 hoe motorbike is equipped with a motor 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.490
 four times we have a deposit of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.070
 oil and a gas tank 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 independent is the one from the other before 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.780
 to start up the mustard da 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.780
 we will put oil in the tank 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.740
 later we will put gasoline in the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740
 Fuel tank 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.850
 and we can start the machine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.110
 once we have put gasoline and 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.300
 oil in our motorcycle to room 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.030
 we will proceed to its start in the first 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.670
 place we will connect the switch in the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.790
 next position 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.670
 we will open the gasoline passage with the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.239
 key to that effect and subsequently 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.310
 we will open the air passage of the starter 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.220
 we will accelerate the machine to its maximum 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 revolutions and we will pull the rope of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.850
 start always in two phases one 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.280
 first phase that will hook us and 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.280
 a second that will start the brand 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.480
 we can find ourselves motoazadas of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.670
 different powers we will have many to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.739
 the electric ones that go from about 300 to a thousand 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.959
 watts and motorized gasoline that 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.599
 they are comprised between three horses and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.880
 half or six horses depending on their 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.210
 power we can perform jobs in 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.950
 greater or lesser surface 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.760
 The hoe motorbike is equipped with a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.580
 handlebar adjustable in height 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.590
 what can we accommodate according to the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.409
 work to be done or the height of the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.200
 user the motoazadas have three types 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.870
 Transmission shaft endless box 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 changes and chains or belts as is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.040
 our case the machines with box 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.700
 changes offer us greater strength and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.040
 resistance the motor cultivators are equipped 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.040
 with several marches marches forward 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.520
 and backs that allow you a 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.330
 greater maneuverability and thus be able to avoid 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.460
 obstacles the hoe bike is equipped with 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.400
 a set of several strawberries the strawberries 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.740
 It is a set of four blades to 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.810
 greater number of strawberries we will have a 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.630
 wider working width and it will allow us 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.130
 work on a larger surface the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.520
 strawberry will sink into the ground to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.140
 perform such work as advice is 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.600
 recommended that if we are not going to use the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.580
 mustard for a long period let's leave 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.190
 the empty fuel tank 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.600
 completely and to exhaust the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.530
 fuel that could be in the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.150
 carburetor 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.490
 pluck the machine until it 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.490
 stop for lack of gasoline 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.130
 And here our demonstration will 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.199
 We invite you to visit our stores 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.639
 leroy merlin where you can learn more 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.639
 in our demonstrations classroom
