 welcome guys in this new video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.180
 york knicks art today with subjects 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.750
 today explains you feel that mirrors that 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.670
 they are the purpose of fucking time and 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.700
 then in fact these three simple 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 gimmicks have no use then for 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.539
 do the trick or jump sequel 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
 with the tanks you have to have the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.670
 personal tank I leave the link 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.320
 in description on as an armed component 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 before being so different that how 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.050
 you will know well to complete armed 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 must be level 70 then 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.210
 we take tank to you we head 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.210
 to the position 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.840
 ok here is the point of the map 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.020
 to reach this exact point is that yes 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.020
 located near the golf course 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.659
 then in this alley at the bottom there is a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.570
 gate you must enter the gate a 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.890
 half between entry and exit and you will have to 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.970
 turn the punk to the right 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.080
 ok done that you have to go ahead e 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.990
 back forward back with the wagon 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.610
 armed is more backward than forward because 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.610
 if you do n't love it will work well 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.100
 ok result will be this 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.160
 Nice is not it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.720
 then if you struggle with this 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.910
 simple baldo will succeed jumps again 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.680
 much bigger then we go immediately to 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.270
 second turchetta to do if this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.450
 simple trick you must have 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.990

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.990
