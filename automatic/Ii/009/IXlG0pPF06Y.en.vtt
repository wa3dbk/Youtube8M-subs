 strategy games until a few years ago the pc market undisputed ruler 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.079
 despite the fact that the state of the art engineer continues to be this type 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.059
 enriched by a good number of productions among which stand out 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.629

 new feature options as the different from the campaign will begin 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.020
 as you can tell me as the singing of the powerful Hanseatic League population 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 commercial coop and from the north europe twelfth century recommended small 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.630
 Double baskets with discreet. aside our task will obviously be 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.240
 that of multiplying the funds at your disposal so as to earn gods 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.140
 respect within the league and Sunday growing trade trail 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.750
 segrate penis dogs we can afford the second ship maybe the complex 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.200
 residential is a company of origin through satisfaction of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.590
 need of the boroughs of the league we will gain respect in favor between the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.700
 population local administrators who will give us the opportunity to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.680
 to establish a new commercial flow - teaching or the bridgehead 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 to start industrial activities even outside our city of origin 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.570
 increases in weight within a community we could acquire 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.080
 rights to build new productive settlements to embellish the city and so 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.410
 away in a kind of third-party sites simplified rate if our popularity in 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.070
 an elevated san village we could also stand as mayor position that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 he knew construction questions while the great fame of the interior of the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.750
 league will allow us to enter the council bit persia point to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 presidency final purpose of the campaign 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.580
 as we have seen the game divided between moments of books, of the management of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.820
 trade routes where the guides of a vessel must attempt to post 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.980
 amount purchased may local productions price to carry from 2d 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.269
 upon request 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.269
 the second moment is the construction of the activity lawn 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.949
 industrial city management of their own economic interests through 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.489
 the exchanges compliment the very specific tracing the marriages 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.469
 comfortable 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.560
 the bad weather rudder of the clashes for the answer to put on the site to say 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.469
 support management uses the boat and monotony 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.319
 action 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.269
 going into the sun 4 universities will not be a task for everyone 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.069
 and a rock to overcome re-enter. being lacking in play is comfortable 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.499
 everything --- bombings will very often explain, however, which way to go without them though 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.169
 never happy for you active present leave player at the mercy of the 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:45.920
 events 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.870
 The second one. reds could do a little too slow game for 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.810
 to be able to recommend patrician 4 regardless of taste 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.709
 video games 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.720
 this feature usually marks the progress of events brands 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.900
 to a friend of things to do, three advanced moments asked me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.919
 simply to supervise property 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.639
 finally, the lack of any multiplayer option limits strongly 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.290
 the life search of a tapatalk product an option will always be the same as if 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:12.559
 same 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.769
 technically the choice made the girls of tension was that of 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.149
 make patrician 4 of scalable possible so as to make it usable 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.909
 from most computers in circulation this however put in 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.219
 evidence of how perfectly patrician 4 is quite rather gaunt - 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.339
 particularly inspired above all in the variety of cities in the 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.829
 characterization of the different factions 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.729
 from the sound point of view instead of some good background music 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:39.069
 company terrestris effects are great instead dubbing location ad 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.429
 fx interactive work 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.429
 but 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.680
 ffffffff been so exquisitely for PC game lovers 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.660
 professional 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.530
 to see current with past characters that will happen those who 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.140
 they will want to dedicate time to it they will find a rather complex product defined 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.620
 what year is the same as playability in naval battles in the mind 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.709
 subtraction of the main defect campaign mode 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.889
 all those who have fucked the various films the interesting century 1404 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.509
 will find. favorite summer nights
