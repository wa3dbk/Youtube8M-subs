00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.440

 and now to blur it has been said 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.619
 let's take a translucent powder or 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.579
 Compact to seal perfectly 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.579

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.020
 shadow with a lot of light from the pupa mark 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.020
 and I will apply in all park 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650
 Apply on all the mobile eyelid 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.299

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.239
 I will give you light with this pencil 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.129

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.430
 little pink I'm going to put 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.940
 in the lacrimal and in the lower part of 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.010
 now with black color 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.840
 and at the end of the tabs up 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.689

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 talk more and then I'll fill everything 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.170
 the little way 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.290
 and good as I am a little more 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.050
 dramatic then I want to put a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.209
 little darker so I'm going to recharge 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.630
 with darker shadow again the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.630
 basin 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.709
 a pencil and delineate already know in the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.709
 birth of the eyelashes 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.900
 and I want more light a field of shades of 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.500
 lilac color I'm going to put a little bit under 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.500
 from the German 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.870
 it has arrived at the time of the eyelashes 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.930
 we go enchinar the apply them enough 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.610
 mascara up and down to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.610
 that look spectacular 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.930
 now let's define the eyebrow in this 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.120
 I'm going to do it with the palette of 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.360
 Shadows of Maleficent from Marc who has a 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.610
 coffee like chestnut is what I'm going to 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.009
 get my eyebrow and then I'm going to 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.500
 put a little bit of that mascara 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.120
 transparent nothing more to make sure I do not 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.479
 they get disheveled and they stay 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.479
 still 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.999
 we come to one of my favorite moments 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:27.580
 that applies the illuminator remember 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:31.270
 which is above the cheekbone and this time 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.050
 I'm using a liquid cream from the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.050
 penis brand 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.620
 and if you want it to have a little effect 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.449
 more dramatic and it feels more good 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.830
 then we will reinforce it with a 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.830
 powder illuminator 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.699
 the time came in blogs and in this 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.699
 I will apply some shades of pink 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.460
 a little bit more of contour for that of 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.479
 that has the most round face then 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.479
 let's apply it more 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.790
 and let's give the final touch this is 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.180
 a lipstick over in a color that 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.850
 fascinates is like a blouse and we're going to 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.990
 Mark the edges of the lips first 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.990
 and then fill 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.900
 I hope you liked it very much
