00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.880
 Free kick from half right for the blue-yellow and then off-ball from 16vor 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.950
 Borg would have been after the national team so see Ukraine 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.280
 will 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.659
 Heroes the most 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.130
 but already in the wm qualifier against England 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.290
 Backlinks the actually safe defense 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.800
 Positional error cost my life 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 England holds group winners 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.670
 after that Ukraine loses the relegation the World Cup 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.669
 missed that cheer the others 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.160
 but that is not the only problem in 2009 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.800
 In the summer not only Vitali Klitschko 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.050
 but all sympathizers of the Ukrainian sport 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.500
 to appease him 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 uefa president Platini blatantly threatens Ukraine's 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 To withdraw European championship or 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.310
 abgehalfterte hotels from the Soviet era far too small airports 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.060
 congested roads and, most importantly 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 no progress on the stadium buildings 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.410
 gets the yellow card 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.940
 but the Swede only had to move if all in-country understand there are now 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.050
 if there is a jolt now it will be here in the new 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.700
 Olympic Stadium to give the final of the European Football Championship 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 the jolt goes through the country 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 In autumn, the new wm stadium in Berlin will be opened, not just the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.700
 Venue the whole show is top notch 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.270
 For the first time Ukraine shows the ambition that is sure to present 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 as superfluous 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.390
 something big 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.800
 European country 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.850
 the chance 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.210
 water heater 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.280
 for 2000 12 this is unique 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.030
 not just for sports that is so spread to the whole world 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.450
 cuts 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.920
 whether Europe is not only geographically 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340
 and so the cranes continue to turn 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.899
 seven days a week Ukraine is in a hurry on the way to Europe 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.439
 the Euro 2012 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.530
 could be more politically important for the country than today 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:02.510
 Presidential election say many experts 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.860
 most people in Cologne believe this for a long time 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.760
 the euro is the greatest cultural not just culture but, above all, too 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.299
 Economic stimulus program Europe is saying many 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.180
 and lo and behold, that too a few prominent competitors detailer 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.680
 For example, they were devastated because they got this 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.559
 Tournament on the other hand would be the decision was right 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.569
 always before 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.849
 Traveling through the East she knows the mentality of the people many have 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.539
 To create in the end is normal. I mean it's so much motivation 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.849
 behind it how to do more now 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.549
 yes, of course, percent reading so that they get something like that 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.219
 had 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.180
 and there you have to be happy if there is any chance then in the moment 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.529
 they got our second question so far and then they start 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.659
 to think about how that could work and then they see 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.909
 with which things that is connected and that goes on mostly above 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.379
 her powers and that's why there are always questions if that's all 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.809
 Timely completion of the German stock market 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.060
 can handle 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 but I think suddenly it will end up that all that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 then we will also be able to create a wonderful one 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.890
 I also believe that it will be ready by then because they are now finished with 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.340
 the prologue, so to speak to this European championship 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.710
 qualifying draw in Warsaw in Warsaw in the Palace of Culture find the whole 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.470
 today instead of and then would actually be the best goal in the world at two times 30 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.349
 Meters about times tree tops on our picture not quite the right one 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.950
 Time twelve and twenty, they have their very own that is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.500
 now begins the hot phase and the students my colleague Steffen Simon 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.959
 in Warsaw 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.169
 on television keeps track of it 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.579
 Hefti in the district is responsible for losses in the building committee among the residents of 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.609
 Polish capital a controversial warning sign of decades 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.360
 Soviet supremacy in Poland fear that the start of construction in revenge 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.839
 earlier here installation of better party days was held today 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.520
 Hopf football europe 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.430
 in these countries on alone good day warmly welcome also from 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.619
 their parents and teachers 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.469
 in days when the DFB harmony in the face of 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.479
 not exactly happy external presentation completely lost the 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.609
 seems to have been 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.029
 that it does not depend on the luck of being loose today is what it's all about 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.060
 against Le Mont after the World Cup in the next two 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.889
 Oliver is playing for Euro 2012 qualification in Poland and Ukraine 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.169
 Bierhoff it with Joachim Loew quite interesting that he early in the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.240
 Conversation with Prof JÃ¼rgen Bergener has forgotten the subjunctive and now 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.360
 We should get hold of it after the World Cup 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.530
 still be responsible we go the whole thing together but percent of them 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.220
 should 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.850
 which has already been heard almost definitively, hopefully that was only for one 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.670
 stately inaccuracy locally before that they coach of Azerbaijan 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.759
 the celebrities are completely here the only one still has not seen 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.060
 and, of course, the customers like Italy but let's see if he later 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.060
 we'll be there shortly before the draw 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.980
 the two presenters of the day must be here for children and adolescents 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.559
 finally her words Hitzfeld coach Switzerland 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.599
 have led through a small cultural program Donald Tusk the 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.709
 Prime Minister of Poland has welcomed and now are already those 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.740
 here on the stage
