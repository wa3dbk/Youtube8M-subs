couple<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.100> casts<00:01:45.520> you'll<00:01:45.789> get<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:45.999> good<00:01:46.209> grasp

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
couple of casts you'll get a good grasp

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.510 
couple of casts you'll get a good grasp
of<00:01:46.689> how<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.200> works<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.740> actually<00:01:48.249> have<00:01:48.369> like

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
of how this works you actually have like

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.160 
of how this works you actually have like
a<00:01:48.579> split<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:49.030> second<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.539> activate<00:01:50.049> the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
a split of a second to activate the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.449 
a split of a second to activate the
ability<00:01:50.289> once<00:01:50.709> it's<00:01:50.920> reached<00:01:51.130> his<00:01:51.340> maximum

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
ability once it's reached his maximum

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.520 
ability once it's reached his maximum
length<00:01:51.939> as<00:01:52.119> well<00:01:52.329> so<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.840> don't<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.409> use

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
length as well so you don't have to use

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.679 
length as well so you don't have to use
it<00:01:53.709> before<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.340> reaches<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.090> at<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.509> end

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689

potent ganks early on plus her Q could

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.930 
potent ganks early on plus her Q could
be<00:03:13.440> pretty<00:03:13.650> good<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:14.040> jungling<00:03:14.280> since<00:03:14.610> it's

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
be pretty good for jungling since it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.970 
be pretty good for jungling since it's
on<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> quite<00:03:15.600> low<00:03:15.780> cooldown<00:03:16.260> time<00:03:16.620> will<00:03:16.769> tell

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
on a quite low cooldown time will tell

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.319 
on a quite low cooldown time will tell
time<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.489> tell<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.700> would<00:03:17.819> probably<00:03:18.180> throw

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
time will tell I would probably throw

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.789 
time will tell I would probably throw
her<00:03:18.480> down<00:03:18.510> mid<00:03:18.900> though<00:03:19.079> when<00:03:19.260> she<00:03:19.380> goes<00:03:19.560> live

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
her down mid though when she goes live

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:20.690 
her down mid though when she goes live
because<00:03:20.040> that's<00:03:20.430> where<00:03:20.579> I'm<00:03:20.670> most

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
because that's where I'm most

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.789 
because that's where I'm most
comfortable<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.630> do<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:22.410> her<00:03:22.560> as<00:03:22.680> very

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
comfortable and I do see her as very

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.740 
comfortable and I do see her as very
potent<00:03:23.220> there<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.910> max<00:03:24.090> Q<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.480> then<00:03:24.570> puts

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
potent there if you max Q and then puts

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.509 
potent there if you max Q and then puts
a<00:03:24.810> couple<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.350> points<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.680> E<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> very

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
a couple of points in E you got a very

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.910 
a couple of points in E you got a very
scary<00:03:26.910> waveclear<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:28.410> can<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.680> really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
scary waveclear that can be really

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520 
scary waveclear that can be really
potent<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.519> course<00:03:29.790> it'll<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.750> easy<00:03:31.290> to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
potent and of course it'll be easy to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.229 
potent and of course it'll be easy to
pull<00:03:31.709> up<00:03:31.859> for<00:03:32.070> successful<00:03:32.519> ganks<00:03:32.910> with

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
pull up for successful ganks with

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.240 
pull up for successful ganks with
lissandra<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.230> mid<00:03:34.380> lane<00:03:34.410> because<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.130> all

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
lissandra in the mid lane because of all

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.449

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
that sort of almost secure CC that the e

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.690 
that sort of almost secure CC that the e
W<00:03:39.120> combo<00:03:39.510> sets<00:03:40.200> her<00:03:40.350> up<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.459> gonna<00:03:41.549> be

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
W combo sets her up for so it's gonna be

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.580
