00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.499
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.350
 second top 10 pokémon of the type so and so 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:12.090
 video reuters type dragon off because the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.620
 voted majority for it has been 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.480
 you will find another vote in the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.650
 description which type of the next 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 to determine videos 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.369
 So do not forget to vote yes 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.919
 neither are legendary 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.109
 pokémon still mega pokemon and is one 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.509
 completely free chosen list as that is 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 my top 10 and therefore can not 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.439
 be right and not wrong because 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.890
 everyone has a different opinion, good enough 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.989
 equipment 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.489
 Let's go to 10 is my sweet 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.510
 Cairn has become through on the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 next generation 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 I did not have the biggest selection when 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 Type revenge because it just is not that much 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.440
 In the throat, there are pokémon and that's why 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.280
 I do not like just too much to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 know one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 but I have to say that it is in the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.949
 competitive in any case as 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.109
 excellent special well use 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.519
 leaves and his ability viscous 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.379
 I really like it when it's special 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.760
 gets attacked it hardly gets hurt 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.750
 and when it will physically buy 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 against it first by the ability 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.370
 slower to 9th place is a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 see strong like legendary pokémon 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.729
 Which of the probably biggest 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 Camp have been chosen as a favorite 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.420
 both in the game so kompanie me is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.070
 enormously strong in competitive too 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 very versatile do that defensively 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 play physically or offensively as well 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 especially maybe with mega 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 development or sometimes surprising 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.619
 moscow what nobody gets only to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.990
 can be fatal is exactly what 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.790
 many dolls on the list to put the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.280
 four weak ice where we already 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.979
 Let's take a look at the sweet little one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.229
 Deadly model of Pokemon Global 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 many will probably get higher here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.610
 However, I find then classify 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 look something so cute and just not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 as powerful as a traditional costume 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.320
 However, you have to say that it is in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 Anime often enough shown very strong 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 i will not that sweet pokémon i like 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.469
 I 'm just going to be personal for myself 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.719
 are there any other kites that make me feel better 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.369
 like being three years as a 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.840
 semi legendary pokémon right in the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 audio is around with his ability 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.829
 dragon dance weaken multi shop with the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 protection combination very quickly 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.830
 whole team can disassemble 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.990
 Number seven is very active 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.460
 important water dragon i find easy 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.229
 the idea of a deadly lake 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.979
 produce as funny as well as at the same time 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.899
 well done 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.730
 because it works just still 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.740
 threatening and a water dragon 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.290
 I think combination comes with me anyway 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.430
 very much too rare in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.710
 comparative it is one 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.540
 100% clip machine or one 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.130
 good dragon dance number six up 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.680
 my list is again a fourfold 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.390
 Weak Altar a really nice one 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 pokémon i think that was design 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.360
 fantastically implemented 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.580
 you just make a kite 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 in front of the clouds confirmed personally 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.430
 I think the epic took over 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
 third generation what yes mine 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.510
 favorite generation is with the mega 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.640
 form in combination of the type you 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.490
 unique space-five lands in 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.680
 me monaco out the big strong terex 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.540
 thing one of the best 16 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.010
 generation of my eyes upon me 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.720
 personally find that pokémon easy 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.790
 very versatile of the coverage he is using 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 the thunder ice and fire 10 on it 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.090
 can fall back as with many 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.160
 Burgmann on this list has it too 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.840
 the option of haka dance and can 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.370
 quickly after a setup that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 opposing team continue to destroy 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.019
 it goes with place 4 and in the third you 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.300
 set the pokémon isa list hit me 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.370
 know attempts that can say of themselves 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 He does not like this pokémon 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.180
 the look as well as the play style 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.739
 really well done is a great one 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.019
 negative point about him is of course 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.700
 much promise veh with the sixth 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.959
 generation has to live for me though 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.970
 Does not that make it one less 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.739
 strong and cool pokémon now would 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.239
 already exciting and many kites pokémon 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.180
 are no longer left we come to that 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.860
 place number three brutal one again 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 semi legendary pokémon with one 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.970
 four times weak ice for me it is 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.070
 the dragon pokémon which also most likely 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260
 my picture of a dragon is approaching 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.030
 two big wings one tail and one 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.350
 big bitten dangerous white in the game 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.180
 but always since the mega 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.340
 development, it was just deadly and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.900
 was used in Cuba where it was with the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.940
 greatest of legends can keep up 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.010
 versatile like no other dragon 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.590
 physically or specifically whether defensive or 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.480
 offensive it does not matter it will be with you 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.200
 the role you love him too 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.870
 doing work 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.269
 square number 2 in vain to the only 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.530
 true kite for me 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.750
 third generation love 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.160
 successor vander it was also one 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.600
 difficult decision, however, must 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.790
 it is fair to say that the 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.020
 space competitive with no 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.669
 a brother countries can keep up 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.709
 However, I just love that 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.450
 look and has animated mine 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.580
 reminiscences of this pokémon shaped 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.200
 together with the movie with bruce lee 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.880
 berger together with brother land the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.580
 has saved people is left for me 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.860
 simply a great kite of all time 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.470
 again with a four times weak ice 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.210
 and teach until now without the honor of all 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.680
 but now development remains 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.600
 really almost no candidates for the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.610
 dragon pokémon more left but my 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.910
 I place the first place on the strongest 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.650
 Dragon Pokemon of the fifth generation 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.630
 max sachs this decision could be yours 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.700
 as it is not surprising in the reason 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.590
 Strong bird is that I would always 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.750
 yet extremely strong but not just 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.060
 place one, why I like it now 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.860
 The question was placed in first place as me 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.450
 I played black and white 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.100
 in the brick street with a very 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.320
 weak team and have the there 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.060
 Advanced development of max I found 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.830
 I did not like the look 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.419
 I caught and trained him 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.220
 Then I developed from the 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.440
 look totally surprised and have that 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.270
 loved with biotin on his 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.250
 own walls and the camp I have 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.169
 all six bourbons max 6 defeated 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.910
 Does not sound too exciting, though 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.700
 Imagine I have this fight 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.250
 five times the routine so almost the 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.380
 apt word used in war and here 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.180
 not a single misses in 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.500
 Combination with this player experience 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.600
 and the anime i'm just that 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.669
 personal opinion max sachs is that 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.110
 invincible and dangerous kites 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.720
 pokémon of old 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.100
 that's it but now and I want 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 also again offered to tell him that 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.400
 I found it quite surprising that 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.919
 dragon was chosen so strong 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.810
 Of course a great guy was just it 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.940
 the type with the least choice 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.650
 there are only 13 kites made the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.570
 not legendary or mega pokémon are 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.830
 There were smaller fakt spot it okay if 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.020
 I would like you very much 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.850
 my positive reviews then look forward 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.850
 see what the next video and
