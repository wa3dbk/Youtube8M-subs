00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.469
 good morning 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.650
 both car wheels 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.080
 dangerously 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.360
 we counted 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.699
 in the structure and the crossbar 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.819
 option two will check everything 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.839
 and make that word 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.839
 must be properly stored 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.279
 your winter tires to be 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.849
 run for six months if this as 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 it is necessary not to prepare the area 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.470
 will be waiting for an unpleasant surprise 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.520
 tires that have not yet discussed their 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 will require replacement 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.530
 left as is tires spoils where 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.000
 faster than before 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.330
 spend the life of the horseshoe of your iron horse 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.020
 seasonal storage can be correct 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.260
 removing the rubber memory of each tire 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.370
 then guess what she's teles not 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.530
 have to 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.010
 sure to trash the wheels as notes 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.460
 he 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.680
 without limbs itself mace time 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.020
 but until the reagents are forty ford 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.620
 rubber alloy wheels finally 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 drives also need cleaning because reagents 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.830
 do not regret and they need to wash the wheels like 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260
 follows using 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 special shampoo 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.730
 gindin oil and other chemistry overeat 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.050
 deep time 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.090
 if they are not washed away they will gradually 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.230
 collapse of the car butts 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.070
 dry thoroughly after washing 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 wheels outdoors 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.290
 By the way, do not forget to wash yourself 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.380
 the machine is especially hard to reach 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.619
 the places are permanent dirt 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.850
 rolled over the winter 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.960
 accelerates body corrosion 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.670
 summer tires preset on 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 car do not forget to rub 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.110
 check notice and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440
 re-tighten all bolts 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.720
 by the way, experts recommend 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.460
 balancing like 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.190
 at least every 10 thousand kilometers 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.400
 run 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.810
 as a result, we managed to see 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 even with a minor 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 worn out weight wheel is canceled 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.400
 Nikonenko tires in the open air 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.750
 about half a year 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.730
 they say let them speak in Odessa 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.880
 temperatures from will not accept 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.159
 new sunlight 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.600
 which is detrimental to visit 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780
 the room in which you are going to the country 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.309
 tires must be well ventilated 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.869
 it is desirable that the temperature was 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.059
 constantly 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:13.229
 came out at plus twenty-five degrees or 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.969
 at least without sharp fluctuations 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.779
 otherwise it will appear on your wheels 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.449
 microcracks 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.069
 away from the autostyle oil 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.870
 if you decide to pack the wheels 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.639
 pack do not close them tightly leave 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.729
 air access 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.019
 dry well before packing 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.479
 wheels 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.249
 stylist drives do not leave a stack 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.969
 otherwise they will not be lost. 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.639
 will not become unsuitable 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.009
 wheel assembly as a last resort possible 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.059
 put on each other but then not 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.909
 relieve pressure completely 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.079
 Ideally, activity without 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.149
 put the wheels upright 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.599
 while preferably 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.289
 turn over the month 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.669
 so tires themselves and what tread they 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.699
 will be reformed 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.439
 after the guard season 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.579
 now provides 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.809
 the wheels themselves 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:01.409
 specially annual 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.969
 belonging 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.779
 that's how you understand 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.009
 take care of your car 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.229
 main road 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.009
 and green
