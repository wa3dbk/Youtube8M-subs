you may want to go through a few sand

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.849 
you may want to go through a few sand
grains<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:46.410> started

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
grains because when I first started

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.829 
grains because when I first started
looking<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.460> brands<00:00:47.760> wouldn't<00:00:48.059> fit<00:00:48.210> even

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
looking some brands wouldn't fit even

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.729 
looking some brands wouldn't fit even
that<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:48.989> 50<00:00:49.409> mil<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.879> Spitfire<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that out 50 mil this one Spitfire is

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520 
that out 50 mil this one Spitfire is
just<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.789> nice<00:00:54.659> and<00:00:54.719> mount<00:00:55.049> of<00:00:55.170> friction

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
just so nice and mount of friction

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
just so nice and mount of friction
behind<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.579> now<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.729> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> start

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
behind there so now I'm going to start

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.639 
behind there so now I'm going to start
making<00:01:00.269> them<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> taking<00:01:01.049> up<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> bit<00:01:01.409> around

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
making them and taking up a bit around

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.010 
making them and taking up a bit around
pretty<00:01:04.649> simple<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.479> rim<00:01:06.630> next<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
pretty simple just put your rim next to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.469 
pretty simple just put your rim next to
the<00:01:07.140> tube<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.909> Mark<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the tube and Mark a little bit on the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
the tube and Mark a little bit on the
side<00:01:09.690> just<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.789> that<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.000> couple

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
side just like that do that a couple

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
side just like that do that a couple
times<00:01:12.330> till<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.899> got<00:01:12.990> enough<00:01:13.200> curly<00:01:13.500> rims<00:01:14.210> I'm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
times till you got enough curly rims I'm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
times till you got enough curly rims I'm
marking<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.929> ties<00:01:16.700> actually<00:01:17.700> make<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
marking out my ties actually make them a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
marking out my ties actually make them a
little<00:01:18.210> bit<00:01:18.420> bigger<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> rim<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.710> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
little bit bigger than the rim and then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
little bit bigger than the rim and then
what<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> does<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.880> leaves<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
what that does is it leaves a bit of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.540 
what that does is it leaves a bit of
room<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:22.289> allow<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> saw<00:01:23.069> blade<00:01:23.340> came

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
room to allow for the saw blade came

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.580 
room to allow for the saw blade came
through<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> plus<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.140> gives<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
through and plus it gives you a bit of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:02:02.020 
through and plus it gives you a bit of
overhang<00:01:26.069> for<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> tire

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.250 

and<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.120> next<00:02:03.360> step<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.170> yourself

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
and the next step is to get yourself

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.070 
and the next step is to get yourself
some<00:02:04.680> coarse<00:02:05.100> sandpaper<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.940> give<00:02:06.540> each<00:02:06.750> side

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
some coarse sandpaper and give each side

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:32.060 
some coarse sandpaper and give each side
a<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.710> roll<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.990> next<00:02:31.440> step<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
a bit of a roll in the next step is to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.250 
a bit of a roll in the next step is to
place<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> tire<00:02:32.700> onto<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.270> rim<00:02:36.080> should<00:02:37.080> be

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
place a tire onto the rim should be

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.830 
place a tire onto the rim should be
quite<00:02:37.530> tight<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.790> need<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> give<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.720> bit

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
quite tight so you need to give it a bit

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.140 
quite tight so you need to give it a bit
of<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.050> bath<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> mallet<00:02:46.790> tells<00:02:47.790> flush

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
of a bath with the mallet tells flush

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.350 
of a bath with the mallet tells flush
both<00:02:48.450> sides<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.300> find<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.720> too<00:02:51.780> loose

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
both sides if you find it's too loose

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
both sides if you find it's too loose
basically<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.570> do<00:02:55.400> get<00:02:56.400> yourself<00:02:56.730> some

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
basically what you do get yourself some

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
basically what you do get yourself some
tape<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.960> roll<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.140> win<00:03:02.690> teletypes

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
tape and roll the win teletypes

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.130 
tape and roll the win teletypes
all<00:03:04.050> around<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.360> do<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> few<00:03:06.780> layers

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
all around you can do this a few layers

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.280 
all around you can do this a few layers
if<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:09.090> depends<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.780> your

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
if you like this depends on your

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.260 
if you like this depends on your
individual<00:03:10.800> fit<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.520> after<00:03:14.910> you've<00:03:15.060> got<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
individual fit and after you've got the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.750 
individual fit and after you've got the
tape<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> rim<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:16.950> use<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> knife<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
tape on the rim just use a knife and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.979 
tape on the rim just use a knife and
trim<00:03:17.940> off<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.239> excess<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
trim off the excess and this is what the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.330 
trim off the excess and this is what the
tires<00:03:22.200> end<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:22.530> looking<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:22.830> on<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> car

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
tires end up looking like on the car
