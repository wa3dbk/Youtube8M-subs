00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.700
 good welcome everyone to a space 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.190
 we were a little watering my closet and 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.369
 well let's present a little bit of 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.349
 things that are mine that do not necessarily 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.209
 they represent my style I am a little more 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.099
 you hear some things though 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.080
 are things that I do have and that have 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.269
 bailed out and that I want 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.250
 recommend to all men because 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.470
 I think they are super important in their 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.749
 wardrobe background one of the things that 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.939
 they usually recommend me also what 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.520
 I recommend is to have a suit but without 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.990
 But after thinking about it a lot 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.540
 whole suit you can rent them 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.700
 easily anywhere what yes 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.970
 It is indispensable and can not be lacking in 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.360
 those of men are blazers acts 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.370
 or Americans who ask for the shirts 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.650
 I have a couple of recommendations 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.860
 that basically the white shirt a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 gray shirt or sky blue that are what more 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.690
 it is used we also have the pants my 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.540
 recommendation that I think is super 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.380
 basic is to have the blue jeans first 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.150
 that's part of everyone's closet in 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.580
 this country and the rest of the world nothing more 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.340
 nothing is more popular than jeans a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.120
 blue jeans is a boy is 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.710
 combinable 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.270
 the other recommendation is to have a 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.910
 black pants you can also 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.680
 combine with a lot of things and the other 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.620
 for events a little more informal and its 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 inclusion of day never here I think it's 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.540
 important to have a pole the peoples 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.150
 are these also these clothes that you 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.580
 help to see you are neither formal then it is 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.320
 terrific and blusher those are only the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.960
 who are at this moment in fashion for 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.450
 the years now the theme of colors this 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.090
 marÃ­a nin viewers there is a great 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.480
 variety that I tell them the colors more 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.640
 vibrant for less in europe 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.980
 that the summer is coming out 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.660
 vibrant colors talking about clothes 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 basic I think we should sing in 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.550
 neutral colors again white or a 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.560
 blue and beige I think a bit like 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.300
 sowing our grandparents that in 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.840
 that time the bowtie was super 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.790
 important even more than the tie I 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.890
 within the same clothes have a lot 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.190
 of laptops I want to recommend 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.560
 because I think there is a chic touch 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.990
 and that can help in any event 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.110
 They can even help you change the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.450
 look if you wear a bowtie or change 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.450
 a tie that what can help them 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.550
 and what we are going to see now as children is 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.660
 of dots and one of squares that are 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.490
 a little 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.410
 Well, like fashion, but you can 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.950
 work my basic recommendation is 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.489
 to have 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.370
 a pair of dress shoes if we want 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.720
 reduce it the basics a black shoe a 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 pair of black shoes can be in 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.800
 cords or those who are also using 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.620
 get with buckles can be about 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.750
 booties that are also less versatile 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.210
 the same in shoes in brown 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 very good idea the one of jon this is for 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.800
 No man says that I only know
