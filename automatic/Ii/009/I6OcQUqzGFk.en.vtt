00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.650
 johann 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.690
 this is my jockeys like it 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.690
 usually take below with 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.260
 denon hc 4500 with the controller one 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 mixer on top of it comes the laptop like that and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.029
 I was at ikea the other day and I have that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.050
 found here 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:33.570
 These are four led render the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.850
 You can use around shelves or thighs 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 something to illuminate and I have me 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.590
 I thought this under here for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 example below the the stock for 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 the laptop could build under it here 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 down below that would be quite 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 do well and then I have two more 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.630
 about which I can block differently 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.320
 I'll somehow get into the rack 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.090
 install 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 if I had something to worry about 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 or have to change that is still there 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.960
 have a bit of light and have me 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.420
 thought I 'll do a little video 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 does the whole thing exist led 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.190
 then they can do such a distribution 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 be connected to each other 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.270
 here is still a bit cable and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.789
 So he's in the back with the cable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 switch and rear is now driving 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.590
 transformer but such a small one 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.259
 electric so easy part but the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 all four wonderful and you can do that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.509
 Even then, less can be achieved here too 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.920
 use 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.450
 that would not make a difference 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 So how do you do well? 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.440
 and above all things warm light 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:42.030
 I think it's very pleasant and look 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.459
 how it looks the same as I have 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.649
 now down here 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.899
 I have a Led bar directly 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.619
 behind these the black flashback 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.470
 then I have top 1 under the laptop 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.000
 stock and I have one again 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.770
 behind this or below this one 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.530
 black the black one piece there 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.649
 glued it looks a bit like 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 I have to say Christmas tree but 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.149
 the effect is exactly what I wanted 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.480
 namely free lighting of the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.790
 important elements in a dj set like 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.860
 You can see Jay Kay 's team 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.849
 maybe this one better so this one 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.849
 would be about that now 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.810
 the way I would have to the case and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.770
 yes it is absolutely blind free and could 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 already imagine that it at 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 wants next is quite good looks 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.050
 now the cable a bit 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.590
 hide a bit embarrassed and yes 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.700
 I look forward to your comments 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.459
 the installation of the or there at ikea 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.520
 for 20 euros with visual de afford in 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.520
 my title is case practice enjoy
