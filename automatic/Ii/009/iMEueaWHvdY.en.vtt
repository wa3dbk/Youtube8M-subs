00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
countries the blocks are not all

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.650 
countries the blocks are not all
compatible<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.700> will<00:03:36.970> all<00:03:37.209> make<00:03:37.390> them

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
compatible so I will all make them

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.620 
compatible so I will all make them
european-style<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:39.940> my<00:03:40.060> soldering<00:03:40.420> iron

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
european-style this is my soldering iron

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.300 
european-style this is my soldering iron
and<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:43.180> case<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.390> can't<00:03:43.720> see<00:03:43.930> well<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:45.070> can<00:03:45.280> use

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
and in case I can't see well you can use

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.020 
and in case I can't see well you can use
this<00:03:45.550> magnifying<00:03:46.030> glass<00:03:46.300> in<00:03:46.330> these<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.370> small

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
this magnifying glass in these and small

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.960 
this magnifying glass in these and small
hands<00:03:53.310> there<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.890> my<00:03:56.890> next<00:03:57.070> video<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.670> will

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
hands there so my next video I will

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.530 
hands there so my next video I will
demonstrate<00:03:58.180> loading<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.140> battery
