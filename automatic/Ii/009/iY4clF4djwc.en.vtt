all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.380> I'm<00:00:01.439> just<00:00:01.560> taking<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.860> short

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right I'm just taking this short

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.360 
all right I'm just taking this short
video<00:00:02.280> for<00:00:03.350> one<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.410> our<00:00:04.500> good<00:00:04.710> customers<00:00:04.890> here

video for one of our good customers here

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.400 
video for one of our good customers here
we've<00:00:05.580> designed<00:00:05.879> two<00:00:06.299> custom<00:00:06.750> systems<00:00:07.200> for

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we've designed two custom systems for

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.959 
we've designed two custom systems for
him<00:00:07.790> this<00:00:08.790> system<00:00:09.440> is<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.920> an<00:00:11.880> AI<00:00:12.330> NS<00:00:12.660> 280e

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
him this system is for a an AI NS 280e

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.129 
him this system is for a an AI NS 280e
which<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> proteins<00:00:15.630> community<00:00:16.020> there

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
which is the proteins community there

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359 
which is the proteins community there
it's<00:00:16.260> got<00:00:16.410> dual<00:00:16.680> Uihlein<00:00:17.310> pumps<00:00:18.410> on<00:00:19.410> an<00:00:19.980> 8-inch

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
cop it's a really really nice protein

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.910 
cop it's a really really nice protein
skimmer<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:27.359> SuperDuper<00:00:27.869> powerful<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
skimmer got SuperDuper powerful and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
skimmer got SuperDuper powerful and
we've<00:00:29.910> got<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> few<00:00:30.300> cool<00:00:30.599> custom<00:00:30.960> things<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we've got a few cool custom things a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.069 
we've got a few cool custom things a
couple<00:00:31.679> feature<00:00:32.009> updates<00:00:32.399> also<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.820> our

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
couple feature updates also on our

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.930 
couple feature updates also on our
filtration<00:00:34.079> system<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> systems<00:00:35.670> now

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
filtration system all the systems now

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
filtration system all the systems now
have<00:00:36.270> these<00:00:36.420> clear<00:00:37.079> lids<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.739> 3/8<00:00:38.129> inch

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
have these clear lids that are 3/8 inch

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.660 
have these clear lids that are 3/8 inch
thick<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.820> flat<00:00:39.059> polished<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
thick all flat polished so that what you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
thick all flat polished so that what you
can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.030> what's<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.510> inside<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
can see what's going on inside the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.639 
can see what's going on inside the
pre-filter<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> running

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
pre-filter when you have that running

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.750 
pre-filter when you have that running
normally<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.739> also<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.430> protein

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
normally we also did on this protein

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
normally we also did on this protein
skimmer<00:00:48.000> we've<00:00:48.180> done<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.360> once<00:00:48.510> before<00:00:48.660> we're

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
skimmer we've done it once before we're

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.600 
skimmer we've done it once before we're
gonna<00:00:49.200> start<00:00:49.469> offering<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
gonna start offering it I think as a as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
gonna start offering it I think as a as
an<00:00:51.120> option<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:52.140> made<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.379> little

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
an option is we made these little

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.670 
an option is we made these little
adapters<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.489> allow<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> filter<00:00:55.289> sock<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
adapters that allow the filter sock to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
adapters that allow the filter sock to
be<00:00:55.770> attached<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> pipe<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.329> just

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
be attached right to the pipe so it just

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.959 
be attached right to the pipe so it just
comes<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.289> slides<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> can

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
comes with slides down off of it you can

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
comes with slides down off of it you can
see<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> adapter<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.690> inside<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
see the adapter down inside there and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
see the adapter down inside there and
then<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.920> snuggles<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.640> around<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> T

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
then just snuggles up right around the T

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
then just snuggles up right around the T
it's<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.199> cool<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.949> allows<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's really cool because it allows you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
it's really cool because it allows you
to<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> pre-filter<00:01:06.150> sock<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> outlet

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to put the pre-filter sock on the outlet

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.160 
to put the pre-filter sock on the outlet
of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> protein<00:01:08.340> skimmer<00:01:08.840> without<00:01:09.840> having<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of the protein skimmer without having to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
of the protein skimmer without having to
have<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> big<00:01:10.470> contraption<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.310> device<00:01:11.580> inside

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
have a big contraption or device inside

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.039 
have a big contraption or device inside
the<00:01:12.060> tank<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.540> makes<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> easy

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the tank it just makes it easy

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.899 
the tank it just makes it easy
convenient<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.159> only<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
convenient and you only really use it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
convenient and you only really use it
when<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> skimmer<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> making<00:01:16.710> excessive

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
when the skimmer is making excessive

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.530 
when the skimmer is making excessive
bubbles<00:01:17.750> or<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> heavy<00:01:19.229> organic<00:01:19.710> load

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
bubbles or you have a heavy organic load

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.140 
bubbles or you have a heavy organic load
so<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> custom<00:01:23.400> sump<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.939> made

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so this is a custom sump that we made

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.960 
so this is a custom sump that we made
it's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:25.439> much<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.799> close<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> PSRs

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
it's pretty much very close to the PSRs

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's pretty much very close to the PSRs
180<00:01:30.619> South<00:01:31.619> 135<00:01:32.220> 180<00:01:32.490> except<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
180 South 135 180 except where it's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
180 South 135 180 except where it's
pretty<00:01:33.780> narrow<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.290> only<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.710> 12<00:01:35.280> inches

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pretty narrow it's only about 12 inches

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
pretty narrow it's only about 12 inches
wide<00:01:35.670> cuz<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.000> had<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.299> narrow<00:01:37.110> space<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
wide cuz he had a really narrow space to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.969 
wide cuz he had a really narrow space to
fit<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> cap<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.600> sump<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> since<00:01:40.799> we

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
fit the cap the sump in and since we

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
fit the cap the sump in and since we
couldn't<00:01:41.189> put<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> whole<00:01:41.820> sump<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
couldn't put the whole sump with the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
couldn't put the whole sump with the
preet<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> refugium<00:01:45.229> altogether<00:01:46.229> we

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
preet with the refugium altogether we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
preet with the refugium altogether we
made<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> 2<00:01:47.009> separate<00:01:47.340> pieces<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
made it 2 separate pieces so which is a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
made it 2 separate pieces so which is a
really<00:01:48.479> cool<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.689> I'll<00:01:49.170> show<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:51.979> so

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really cool thing I'll show you here so

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
really cool thing I'll show you here so
this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> extension<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this is the extension here this is the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
this is the extension here this is the
refugium<00:01:55.920> part<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.060> did<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.689> I'll

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
refugium part and what we did is I'll

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
refugium part and what we did is I'll
straight<00:01:58.079> over<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.530> pretty<00:01:58.710> cool<00:01:58.920> we

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
straight over here it's pretty cool we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
straight over here it's pretty cool we
basically<00:02:00.119> made<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.990> bucks<00:02:01.469> went<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
basically made it bucks went up next to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
basically made it bucks went up next to
the<00:02:02.100> tank<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.820> separate<00:02:03.240> pieces<00:02:03.390> you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the tank so it's two separate pieces you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
the tank so it's two separate pieces you
can<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.170> here's<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.280> sump<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
can see here here's the one sump and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
can see here here's the one sump and
here's<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> refugium<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.099> base<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.429> we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
here's the refugium and the base what we

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
here's the refugium and the base what we
did<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.759> plumbed<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.020> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
did is we plumbed in right from your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.260 
did is we plumbed in right from your
refugium<00:02:11.009> feet<00:02:11.280> pump<00:02:11.550> here<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> ehind

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
refugium feet pump here in the ehind

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.650 
refugium feet pump here in the ehind
pump

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
pump

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720 
pump
go<00:02:13.290> straight<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> flow<00:02:14.100> control<00:02:14.490> valve

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
go straight up to a flow control valve

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.930 
go straight up to a flow control valve
and<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.630> right<00:02:15.930> through<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.350> wall<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.820> can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and then right through the wall you can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.440 
and then right through the wall you can
see<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> unit<00:02:18.810> seal<00:02:19.020> here<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.270> comes

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
see the unit seal here and that comes

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
see the unit seal here and that comes
right<00:02:21.570> through<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> 45<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:23.220> pumps<00:02:23.610> water

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
right through to a 45 which pumps water

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.390 
right through to a 45 which pumps water
into<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.090> tank<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.280> our

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
into the tank and then we have our

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
into the tank and then we have our
intake<00:02:26.670> screen<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.240> which<00:02:27.720> returns<00:02:28.080> out

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
intake screen here which returns out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.010 
intake screen here which returns out
this<00:02:28.470> outlet<00:02:29.070> assembly<00:02:29.490> here<00:02:29.700> which<00:02:30.450> has<00:02:30.690> a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
this outlet assembly here which has a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.680 
this outlet assembly here which has a
vent<00:02:31.350> pipe<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.400> also<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.790> place<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
vent pipe and then also a place for a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.090 
vent pipe and then also a place for a
filter<00:02:33.990> sock<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.530> attach<00:02:34.710> on<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
filter sock so you can attach on the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.280 
filter sock so you can attach on the
outlet<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.520> there's<00:02:36.210> absolutely<00:02:36.390> no<00:02:36.870> bubbles

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
outlet so there's absolutely no bubbles

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
outlet so there's absolutely no bubbles
anywhere<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:39.000> sub<00:02:39.240> from<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> skimmer<00:02:41.150> in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
anywhere in the sub from the skimmer in

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.600 
anywhere in the sub from the skimmer in
the<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.710> system<00:02:43.980> pump<00:02:44.160> recurrence

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the well or the system pump recurrence

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.390 
the well or the system pump recurrence
so<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.020> real<00:02:46.170> nice<00:02:46.320> system<00:02:47.130> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
so it's just a real nice system it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.060 
so it's just a real nice system it
allows<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.210> wiggle<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.560> larger

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
allows you to kind of wiggle a larger

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.010 
allows you to kind of wiggle a larger
filtration<00:02:50.640> system<00:02:50.970> into<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.210> smaller<00:02:51.540> cabinet

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
filtration system into a smaller cabinet

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.590 
filtration system into a smaller cabinet
or<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> cabinet<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.680> smaller<00:02:52.950> openings<00:02:53.600> but

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
or a cabinet with smaller openings but

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.380 
or a cabinet with smaller openings but
we're<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:54.810> proud<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.130> that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
we're really proud of it you know that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.490 
we're really proud of it you know that
the<00:02:57.390> customer<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.960> like<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.260> he<00:02:58.410> has

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the customer is gonna like and he has

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.660 
the customer is gonna like and he has
another<00:02:58.710> one<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:58.920> basically<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.490> same

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
another one that's basically the same

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.130 
another one that's basically the same
system<00:02:59.910> although<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> smaller

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
system although just with a smaller

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.040 
system although just with a smaller
protein<00:03:01.590> skimmer<00:03:01.920> because<00:03:02.070> he<00:03:02.160> has<00:03:02.280> one<00:03:02.460> big

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
protein skimmer because he has one big

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.370 
protein skimmer because he has one big
tank<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.200> one<00:03:04.350> smaller<00:03:04.680> tank<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.250> anyhow<00:03:06.380> if

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
tank and one smaller tank so anyhow if
