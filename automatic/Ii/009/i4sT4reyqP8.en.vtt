Robins real in the DC Universe but the
skin<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.640> could<00:01:15.390> believe<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.960> read<00:01:16.140> a

skin I could believe it I would read a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920

comic<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.670> Robin<00:01:18.030> wasn't<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.450> he

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
comic if that Robin wasn't it because he

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469
