00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
relatively small not too small I mean

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.859 
relatively small not too small I mean
like<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> double<00:00:30.060> downs<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.449> pieces<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
like the double downs two pieces of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
like the double downs two pieces of
chicken<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.289> pieces<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> bacon<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.189> two

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
pieces of cheese not that small but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
pieces of cheese not that small but
those<00:00:34.890> had<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.370> excess<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.149> thousand

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
those had in excess of a thousand

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.920 
those had in excess of a thousand
calories<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.020> piece<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.520> mean<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
calories a piece and I mean that's just

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
calories a piece and I mean that's just
a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.680> sit<00:00:40.980> down<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.430> little<00:00:41.610> meal

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
a lot for one sit down one little meal

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.380 
a lot for one sit down one little meal
so<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:43.250> xalapa<00:00:44.329> has<00:00:45.329> 650<00:00:46.050> calories<00:00:47.270> 350<00:00:48.270> from

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
so this xalapa has 650 calories 350 from

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.650 
so this xalapa has 650 calories 350 from
fat<00:00:48.660> 650<00:00:49.440> calories<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.219> 1300<00:00:51.090> milligrams<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
fat 650 calories and 1300 milligrams of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
fat 650 calories and 1300 milligrams of
sodium<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.680> obviously<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.370> fast-food<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sodium now obviously it's fast-food I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
sodium now obviously it's fast-food I
know<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.510> no<00:00:54.690> big<00:00:54.719> deal<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.440> saying

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
know it's no big deal but I was saying

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
know it's no big deal but I was saying
it's<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> big<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.660> that's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's not really that big and that's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
it's not really that big and that's
quite<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> bit<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.980> sit-down<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.789> meal

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
quite a bit for one sit-down one meal

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but enough talking about how bad it is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280

because I'm not too big of a fan of the
beef<00:01:12.450> stew<00:01:12.659> lupus<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> absolutely<00:01:13.320> love

the steak chalupas

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.929 
the steak chalupas
so<00:01:15.500> packaging<00:01:16.500> pretty<00:01:16.920> simple<00:01:17.340> big<00:01:17.610> things

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so packaging pretty simple big things

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.320 
so packaging pretty simple big things
come<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.299> big<00:01:18.330> packages<00:01:19.580> XXL<00:01:20.580> everywhere<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
come in big packages XXL everywhere and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.130 
come in big packages XXL everywhere and
so<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> guess<00:01:22.439> we'll<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.560> open<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:24.140> there

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so I guess we'll just open it up there

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
so I guess we'll just open it up there
we<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.369> well<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.700> lighting

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we go I don't know how well my lighting

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
we go I don't know how well my lighting
is<00:01:27.150> making<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.570> look<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.220> see

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
is making this look here but you can see

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
is making this look here but you can see
it's<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> picture<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> try

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's not really like the picture I try

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.359 
it's not really like the picture I try
to<00:01:31.049> find<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> picture<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> just

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to find a picture of it but it just

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.560 
to find a picture of it but it just
recently<00:01:32.549> came<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:33.509> too

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
recently came out so there's not too

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
recently came out so there's not too
many<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.670> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
many but that's kind of what it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.980 
many but that's kind of what it's
supposed<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> said<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> got

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990

how<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.420> works<00:02:40.660> out<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.010> show

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
how all that works out but the show

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.190 
how all that works out but the show
seems<00:02:42.760> bigger<00:02:43.060> but<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> seems<00:02:43.600> like<00:02:43.780> about<00:02:44.020> the

um<00:03:16.780> but<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:18.100> hard<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> wrap<00:03:18.549> your

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
um but it's a little hard to wrap your

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.729 
um but it's a little hard to wrap your
whole<00:03:18.880> mouth<00:03:19.030> around<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.690> at<00:03:20.230> least<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.470> first

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
whole mouth around it at least the first

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.380 
whole mouth around it at least the first
bite<00:03:20.950> was<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> other<00:03:21.850> end<00:03:22.000> stick<00:03:22.269> out

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
bite was because the other end stick out

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.789 
bite was because the other end stick out
so<00:03:22.600> much<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.079> me<00:03:23.200> that's<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.470> best<00:03:23.650> part

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
so much and to me that's the best part

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.080 
so much and to me that's the best part
of<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.950> chalupa<00:03:24.310> when<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.519> bite<00:03:24.700> down<00:03:24.730> on

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
of the chalupa when you bite down on

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.780 
of the chalupa when you bite down on
both<00:03:25.239> sides<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> fluffy<00:03:26.079> tortilla<00:03:26.470> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
both sides of the fluffy tortilla and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.240 
both sides of the fluffy tortilla and
you<00:03:27.790> get<00:03:27.940> all<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.239> filling<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.750> between<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:30.220> I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
you get all the filling in between but I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.830 
you get all the filling in between but I
mean<00:03:30.489> surprisingly<00:03:31.030> enough<00:03:31.329> it<00:03:31.510> tastes<00:03:31.750> like

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
mean surprisingly enough it tastes like

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.870

more<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.269> said<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.540> one<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:43.840> got

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.420 
believe they're $2.99 I think like 320
for<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.360> normal<00:03:55.840> state<00:03:56.079> chalupas<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.160> for

for the normal state chalupas so for

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.400 
for the normal state chalupas so for
what<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:57.730> 80<00:03:58.000> cents<00:03:58.360> more<00:03:58.570> I'm<00:03:58.840> getting<00:03:59.049> way

what like 80 cents more I'm getting way
more<00:03:59.440> beef<00:03:59.860> it's<00:04:00.850> definitely<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.299> good<00:04:01.360> price

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
more beef it's definitely a good price

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.000 
more beef it's definitely a good price
because<00:04:01.930> obviously<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.500> tastes<00:04:02.709> just<00:04:02.769> like<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
because obviously it tastes just like a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.650 
because obviously it tastes just like a
chalupa<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.730> really<00:04:03.880> how<00:04:04.120> much<00:04:04.269> bang<00:04:04.510> am

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
tube obviously but it's definitely

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.230 
tube obviously but it's definitely
better<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.099> because<00:04:38.219> it's<00:04:38.550> more<00:04:39.000> bang
