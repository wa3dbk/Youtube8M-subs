00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.999 
rig and we're very happy with it get
some<00:06:58.220> about<00:07:02.030> 27<00:07:03.030> miles<00:07:03.210> to<00:07:03.510> the<00:07:03.600> gallon<00:07:03.840> on

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:06.009 
some about 27 miles to the gallon on

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.929 
some about 27 miles to the gallon on
the<00:07:06.099> city<00:07:06.819> streets<00:07:07.029> and<00:07:07.949> 25<00:07:08.949> miles<00:07:09.219> the<00:07:09.460> gallon

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:09.939

the city streets and 25 miles the gallon
on<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:10.330> highway<00:07:10.419> so<00:07:10.960> it<00:07:11.080> gets<00:07:11.169> less<00:07:11.409> than<00:07:11.619> a

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
on the highway so it gets less than a

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.019 
on the highway so it gets less than a
highway<00:07:11.919> that<00:07:11.949> does<00:07:12.279> in<00:07:12.430> the<00:07:12.550> city<00:07:12.819> because

highway that does in the city because
the<00:07:13.419> electric<00:07:14.259> motor<00:07:14.409> runs<00:07:14.710> a<00:07:15.389> lot<00:07:16.389> of<00:07:16.539> the

the electric motor runs a lot of the

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.980 
the electric motor runs a lot of the
time<00:07:16.869> in<00:07:17.050> the<00:07:17.169> in<00:07:17.680> the<00:07:17.710> city<00:07:18.419> roof<00:07:19.419> rack<00:07:19.659> up<00:07:19.839> on
