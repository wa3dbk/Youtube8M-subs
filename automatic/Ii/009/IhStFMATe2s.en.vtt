hello<00:00:00.570> welcome<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.290> today's<00:00:01.530> harmonica

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hello welcome to today's harmonica

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.390 
hello welcome to today's harmonica
lesson<00:00:02.429> so<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.330> thought<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.720> could<00:00:03.870> take<00:00:04.400> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
lesson so I thought we could take the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.110 
lesson so I thought we could take the
beginner<00:00:05.670> kind<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.600> rhythm<00:00:06.990> chugging<00:00:08.120> idea

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
beginner kind of rhythm chugging idea

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.160 
beginner kind of rhythm chugging idea
and<00:00:09.510> turn<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.380> into<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:11.099> full<00:00:11.780> 12<00:00:12.780> bar<00:00:13.049> example

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
and turn it into a full 12 bar example

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.529 
and turn it into a full 12 bar example
so<00:00:16.170> if<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.070> remember<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.580> did<00:00:17.760> something<00:00:18.359> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
so if you remember we did something that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:30.669 
so if you remember we did something that
sounds<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> little<00:00:19.080> bit<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.590 

so<00:00:31.679> you're<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.910> alternating<00:00:32.910> between<00:00:33.239> holes

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
so you're just alternating between holes

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.920 
so you're just alternating between holes
two<00:00:34.370> holes<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.090> draw<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> three

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
two holes three so to draw and three

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
two holes three so to draw and three
draw<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:37.920> putting<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.280> little

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
draw and then you're putting your little

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.959 
draw and then you're putting your little
chugging<00:00:38.969> rhythm<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.360> between<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.790> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
chugging rhythm in between so you can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
chugging rhythm in between so you can
turn<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.270> into<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.629> full<00:00:42.870> 12<00:00:43.140> bar<00:00:43.379> blues<00:00:43.850> which

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
turn this into a full 12 bar blues which

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
turn this into a full 12 bar blues which
I'll<00:00:45.030> play<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.590> then

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I'll play through for you now and then

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.869 
I'll play through for you now and then
I'll<00:00:47.610> talk<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> through<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:49.160> one<00:00:50.160> two

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I'll talk you through it so one two

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:26.690 
I'll talk you through it so one two
three<00:00:51.690> four

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.130 

so<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.759> got<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.330> bit<00:01:28.479> carried<00:01:28.600> away<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.020> end

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
so I got a bit carried away at the end

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.080 
so I got a bit carried away at the end
but<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.770> get<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.040> basic<00:01:30.190> idea

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
but you get the basic idea

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.480 
but you get the basic idea
so<00:01:32.080> we're<00:01:32.410> maintaining<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.920> same<00:01:33.130> kind<00:01:33.369> of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
so we're maintaining the same kind of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.330 
so we're maintaining the same kind of
structure<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.479> rhythm<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.710> just<00:01:35.740> changing

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
structure and rhythm and just changing

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.880 
structure and rhythm and just changing
which<00:01:36.490> notes<00:01:36.759> you're<00:01:37.000> playing<00:01:37.650> kind<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:38.710> on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
which notes you're playing kind of on

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.249 
which notes you're playing kind of on
beats<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.210> three<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.990> fact<00:01:41.140> you're<00:01:41.229> not

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
beats one and three in fact you're not

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.389 
beats one and three in fact you're not
even<00:01:41.380> really<00:01:41.680> changing<00:01:42.009> what<00:01:42.100> you're<00:01:42.160> playing

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
even really changing what you're playing

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.100 
even really changing what you're playing
on<00:01:42.550> beat<00:01:42.729> three<00:01:43.000> too<00:01:43.330> much<00:01:43.539> it's<00:01:43.720> just<00:01:43.780> what

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
on beat three too much it's just what

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.660 
on beat three too much it's just what
you're<00:01:44.229> playing<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.680> beat<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.100> depending<00:01:45.580> on

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you're playing on beat one depending on

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.850 
you're playing on beat one depending on
what<00:01:45.820> chord<00:01:46.060> you're<00:01:46.180> playing<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.800> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
what chord you're playing so for the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.359 
what chord you're playing so for the
first<00:01:48.100> four<00:01:48.490> bars<00:01:48.729> you're<00:01:49.330> playing<00:01:49.570> there<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
first four bars you're playing there so

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.859 
first four bars you're playing there so
that<00:01:54.520> means<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.880> you're<00:01:55.000> playing<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.509> four

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
that means that you're playing that four

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
that means that you're playing that four
times<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.410> you're<00:01:56.500> doing<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.160> draw<00:01:57.539> three<00:01:58.539> draw

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
times so you're doing to draw three draw

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020 
times so you're doing to draw three draw
times<00:02:00.520> four<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:03.100> I'm<00:02:03.430> assuming<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.880> can

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
times four and so I'm assuming you can

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.790 
times four and so I'm assuming you can
already<00:02:04.180> play<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.660> if<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.930> can't<00:02:05.200> go<00:02:05.560> back

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
already play that if you can't go back

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.880 
already play that if you can't go back

that's the first Bend on a three-hole
draw<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:42.530> now<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.190> can't<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.760> Bend

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
draw for now if you can't get that Bend

draw for now if you can't get that Bend
do<00:02:45.050> not<00:02:45.230> fret<00:02:45.530> just<00:02:46.190> play<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.850> clean<00:02:47.060> three

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
do not fret just play the clean three

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.130 
do not fret just play the clean three
ball<00:02:47.360> draw<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:48.230> won't<00:02:48.410> sound<00:02:48.940> quite<00:02:49.940> right<00:02:50.140> but

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
ball draw it won't sound quite right but

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.199 
ball draw it won't sound quite right but
it's<00:02:51.440> just<00:02:51.620> good<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.100> get<00:02:52.250> practicing<00:02:52.970> jumping

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
it's just good to get practicing jumping

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.020 
it's just good to get practicing jumping
between<00:02:53.660> those<00:02:53.810> two<00:02:54.020> holes<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.470> doing<00:02:54.739> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.949 

getting<00:03:02.030> comfort<00:03:02.300> with<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.540> rhythm<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:02.900> I

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
getting comfort with that rhythm so I

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.900 
getting comfort with that rhythm so I
just<00:03:03.110> play<00:03:03.230> through<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.470> really<00:03:03.800> slowly<00:03:04.040> if

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
just play through that really slowly if

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.370 
just play through that really slowly if
you<00:03:04.940> can<00:03:05.180> bend<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.510> three-hole<00:03:05.959> draw<00:03:06.170> that's
