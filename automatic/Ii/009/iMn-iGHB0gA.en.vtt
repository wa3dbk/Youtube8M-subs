00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.920 

like<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:14.399> more<00:01:14.759> serving<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> fact<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
like any more serving the fact that I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.430

replayed<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.409> slaughter

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
replayed the slaughter

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.220 
replayed the slaughter
tons<00:01:17.680> before<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.250> got<00:01:18.400> this<00:01:18.610> or<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.660> run<00:01:20.020> that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
tons before it got this or this run that

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:35.859 
tons before it got this or this run that
I<00:01:20.260> was<00:01:20.410> eventually<00:01:20.590> satisfied<00:01:21.340> with

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.840 

so<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> skateboard<00:01:38.100> pick<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.729> right

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so there's a skateboard pick it up right

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.020 
so there's a skateboard pick it up right
now<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> basically<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:40.829> can't<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> back<00:01:41.850> when

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
now and basically you can't go back when

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.130 
now and basically you can't go back when
you<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> stapler<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> tip<00:01:42.960> going
