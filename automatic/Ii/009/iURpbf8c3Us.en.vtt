loss ratio to to unlock isn't home but

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.560 
loss ratio to to unlock isn't home but
for<00:00:22.769> each<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.070> would<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> even<00:00:23.550> better<00:00:23.580> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
for each one would be even better so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
for each one would be even better so
this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.410> why<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:25.619> doing<00:00:25.859> my<00:00:25.949> scene<00:00:26.160> I've<00:00:26.400> got

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
this is why I've doing my scene I've got

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.429 
this is why I've doing my scene I've got
I'm<00:00:26.820> trying<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> make<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.630> whole<00:00:27.779> TLC<00:00:28.230> team

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I'm trying to make the whole TLC team

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.880 
I'm trying to make the whole TLC team
and<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.189> hazard<00:00:30.140> left<00:00:31.140> forward<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> then

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and get hazard left forward and then

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.940 
and get hazard left forward and then
make<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.340> teams<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.410> reviews<00:00:34.829> on

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
make other teams and then do reviews on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.709 
make other teams and then do reviews on
them<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.329> far<00:00:36.540> I've<00:00:36.600> got

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
them so this is what was so far I've got

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.790 
them so this is what was so far I've got
checking<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.290> 84<00:00:38.629> he<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:40.530> really

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
checking that the 84 he is really really

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.979 
checking that the 84 he is really really
good<00:00:41.010> keeper<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> chef<00:00:42.809> knees

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
good keeper actually have a chef knees

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
good keeper actually have a chef knees
also<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.789> doesn't<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> key

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
also good and it doesn't have a key

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
also good and it doesn't have a key
chemistry<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.190> says<00:00:47.430> noon

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
chemistry one but if you put says noon

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.560 
chemistry one but if you put says noon
that<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> basically<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> team

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
that so basically this is like the team

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.180 
that so basically this is like the team
to<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> full<00:00:52.590> Chelsea<00:00:52.980> team

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to get if you get the full Chelsea team

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.869 
to get if you get the full Chelsea team
my<00:00:53.850> neck<00:00:54.059> squad<00:00:54.449> update<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.140> hopefully

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
my neck squad update will be hopefully

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
my neck squad update will be hopefully
what<00:00:56.879> I've<00:00:56.969> done<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.329> team<00:00:57.600> next

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
what I've done with my team next

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
what I've done with my team next
hopefully<00:00:58.469> should<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> full<00:00:59.300> Chelsea<00:01:00.300> team

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
hopefully should be full Chelsea team

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
hopefully should be full Chelsea team
shares<00:01:01.199> needa<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.129> exchange<00:01:02.370> for

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
shares needa what you can exchange for

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
shares needa what you can exchange for
so<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.570> doesn't<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:03.960> affect<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.500> hundred

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
so it doesn't really affect the hundred

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.160 
so it doesn't really affect the hundred
