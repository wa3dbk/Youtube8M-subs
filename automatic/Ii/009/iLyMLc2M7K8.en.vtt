probably quite difficult to see with the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.860 
probably quite difficult to see with the
camera<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.700> pointing<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.809> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
camera but I'm pointing just kind of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
camera but I'm pointing just kind of
blank<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.260> hand<00:00:34.469> over<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.160> pointing

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
blank my hand over here I'm pointing

blank my hand over here I'm pointing
over<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.450> side<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.110> fact<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
over to this side which in fact is the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520 
over to this side which in fact is the
spot<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.270> side<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.379> I'll

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
spot and then this side here which I'll

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.799 
spot and then this side here which I'll
kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> cover<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> way<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
light head itself has got some options

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
light head itself has got some options
on<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> there's<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.530> bracketry<00:00:50.010> here

that's not included with the light head

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
that's not included with the light head
