00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.559

 and he was also very pleased then very popular 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.290

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.499

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.499
 a piece from my collection is something special engraved 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 So always was 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.620
 Here we see in the OPEC from Spain 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 at the Argentina so in the the final price series appeared dipped in the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.220
 Most Imperva in the prospect no longer ask for but first IPOs 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.610
 Here we see a famous German brochure 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 also a Jedi brochure 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 her an advertisement from the year 1980 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.609
 also for the ATSE 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.850
 As always, I start with the first box here is the Embraer Box from the year 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 1981 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.039

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.790
 clearly no label recognize 19 o'clock 82 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 the left side and the back side were identical 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.929
 here we do not go to the boxhorn pauli-tor 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.380
 except for the movie title 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.139
 and always lettering 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.419
 Sense the two boxes of Embraer and the absolutely identical 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.969
 Here we see the European idea box with the one in Domo deep 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.260
 because you had a lot of customers in Germany 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 here also with German lettering 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.379
 Here we see the content of an original packaging Iglesias 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 Especially interesting are the ones in the boxes 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 Here we see him Kadir arch 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.569
 Here we see bags with the many small parts 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.019
 and see here how the instructions for use 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 and we see and the good piece 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.339
 Here we see the head of the Arts Theis 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.569
 where the cockpit is at the same time 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.059
 the cockpit 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.059
 for it first went over each one cannon 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 At the top it has a wobmann seemed to guarantee 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.309
 and at the cockpit 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.309
 over a double-barreled cannon 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.039
 The cockpit comes in two ways 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.859
 once the combo ca 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.059
 and as a second option 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.059
 you grab the whole roof off the hook 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.779
 the cockpit Burgplatz for a figure 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.150
 nine rooms 82 you had to decide one or two seats 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.810
 Since it was not known how the crew of the ADFC had decided it was 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.099
 the single-seater 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.319
 In 1986, as part of a new series of ZTE from the ADFC as 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.319
 Design two-seater 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.930
 behind the cockpit they save failed 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.599
 Moved around in this world you could let the little one go 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.240
 press the button and move the two 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.849
 Finally, let's look at some details 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.999
 Finally, I want to show you briefly what we practice a few years ago way 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:04.400

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 one of the BBC 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:11.749
 we saw a nightmare 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.749
 the figures probably still put screws 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.139
 Let's make a little flight around the merry ones 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.800

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.340

 especially the display in the end she does not because with the beautiful woman I have to 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.060
 put an end to it now 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.340
 when you've talked about everything about the cast made in this 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.819
