00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.379
 This clutch is not for a family sedan 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 and for a racing car with an engine 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.170
 1800 horsepower without it 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.599
 powerful grip would be impossible 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 transfer all this energy to the wheels and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:27.420
 sore could not develop such a high 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 speed in racing cars manual 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 power transmission 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.070
 the wheels therefore stand behind each victory 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.149
 good grip 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.260
 production begins with a flywheel 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.489
 connecting clutch to the engine 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 computer call on and cutting tools 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.050
 aluminum shapes and then 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 cut out the bearing disc for the clutch they 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.280
 cut it around the perimeter to set 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.280
 he has the right profile and reduce weight 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 then with a diamond bolt 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.440
 tipped level surface 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.320
 iron friction disc 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.780
 it will improve his contact with others. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 clutch parts are usually in 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 clutch car two or three such disc 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 clutch discs will move closely 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 this steel insert mounted 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.880
 on the flywheel master puts on the bolts 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 blocking element 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.940
 and then we screw the name inset to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.410
 flywheel here master tightens the bolts 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.410
 up to the exact torque 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 then for better contact with the disk 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.840
 clutch it with a grinding stone 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.840
 levels the surface of the steel insert 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.840
 these bolts securely connect the clutch to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.770
 flywheel they are called bald holders 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.770
 there are six of them 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.459
 and here do titanium cylinders 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:21.980
 who will keep the bald 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.060
 Titanium durable and fixed in flywheel 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.580
 light material 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 this is very important because the clutch transmits 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 huge amount of energy 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.980
 such a cylinder is put on each bolt 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 then supporting wheels are put on the flywheel 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:50.940
 and plate float now 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.230
 pre-height is set 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.460
 holders are then prepared 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.830
 pressure plate aluminum outer 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.830
 rings are pressed into the hole on the cover 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.320
 for these rings will keep the springs with 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.410
 which will change the pressure 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.890
 in the clutch package but the springs themselves are not yet 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.580
 inserted first on the lid 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.360
 set several levers in 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.000
 every lever 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.580
 they lowered the pivot pin 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.580
 will compress and unclamp the clutch pack 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.970
 clutch spring screws are covered with 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 mask and then aluminum 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.750
 case 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.000
 after that they are inserted into each 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.950
 ring 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.700
 then where to put high strength 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.710
 the spring is now from the inside 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720
 the cover is installed pressure plate 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.180
 when the driver releases the pedal 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.060
 clutch levers force push 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.070
 ring compress clutch package as a result 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.110
 bringing energy from the engine to 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.730
 transmission now bolts on holders 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.450
 pressure ring is worn and 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.340
 secured with nuts 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.740
 each holder is tightened end 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.100
 with a wrench and then checked them 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.100
 height 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.180
 measured leverage so that they all 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.650
 same length and produced 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.650
 necessary fit 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.639
 master raises leverage to check 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.199
 grip pressure ring reacts so 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.509
 how it should respond 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.229
 creates the right pressure on the clutch and 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.099
 finally the certification sticker and 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.460
 packing tape to 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.889
 transportation nothing was damaged on 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.220
 track grip will be checked before 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:57.740
 every run and if it works 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.740
 sure win guaranteed
