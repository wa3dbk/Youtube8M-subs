the<00:00:56.820> difference<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.660> 12<00:00:57.930> by<00:00:58.440> 9<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:59.520> one

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the difference that's a 12 by 9 this one

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
the difference that's a 12 by 9 this one
is<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> 12<00:01:00.180> by<00:01:00.329> 8<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> half<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.260> they're

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
is a 12 by 8 and a half so they're

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
is a 12 by 8 and a half so they're
almost<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> same<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.219> head<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
almost the same and that head on that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
almost the same and that head on that
one<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> MRX<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.010> head<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
one on the MRX is the head that it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
one on the MRX is the head that it's
pulled<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> same

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
pulled off of this so about the same

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
pulled off of this so about the same
they<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.520> clear<00:01:08.790> ambassadors<00:01:09.360> top<00:01:09.600> and

bottom<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.100> master<00:01:11.490> works<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.390> said

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bottom on the master works that's I said

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
bottom on the master works that's I said
a<00:01:13.500> couple<00:01:13.770> months<00:01:14.100> old<00:01:14.250> used<00:01:14.700> no<00:01:15.119> dents<00:01:15.420> no

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
a couple months old used no dents no

a couple months old used no dents no
pits

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pits

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
pits
you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> stretched<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:19.130> clear

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you know stretched a little bit clear

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
you know stretched a little bit clear
ambassador<00:01:20.580> also<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.479> got<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> black

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
ambassador also and it's got the black

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
ambassador also and it's got the black
ebony<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> bottom<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.970> think

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
ebony on the bottom which I think

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840 
ebony on the bottom which I think
visually<00:01:24.450> since<00:01:25.049> those<00:01:25.500> things<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:25.979> natural

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
visually since those things are natural

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
visually since those things are natural
finish<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> inside<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> gives<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
finish on the inside it just gives a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.350 
finish on the inside it just gives a
cool<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> bottom<00:01:29.729> heads<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
cool I like the bottom heads when the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
cool I like the bottom heads when the
black<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.810> something<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.130> don't

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
black on something like that I don't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.980 
black on something like that I don't
have<00:01:32.820> anything<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.630> because

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
have anything like that on this because

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
have anything like that on this because
as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.439> especially<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> snare

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
as you can see especially from the snare

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.230 
as you can see especially from the snare
the<00:01:35.700> inside<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> everything<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.630> red<00:01:37.009> so

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the inside of everything is red so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
the inside of everything is red so
anyway<00:01:39.240> let<00:01:39.479> me<00:01:39.509> demonstrate<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> tuning

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
anyway let me demonstrate the tuning

00:01:41.670 --> 00:04:18.330 
anyway let me demonstrate the tuning
I've<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:41.970> here

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:39.140 

you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.210 

you
