00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
they're a four Gamakatsu screw lock

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
they're a four Gamakatsu screw lock
swimbait<00:01:36.090> hook<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.560> gonna<00:01:37.680> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
swimbait hook and all we're gonna do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.760 
swimbait hook and all we're gonna do
with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.610> simple<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.119> easy

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
with this it's really simple really easy

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.580 
with this it's really simple really easy
when<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:42.170> spike<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.409> then

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
when it's got a little spike right then

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.660 
when it's got a little spike right then
what<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.280> stick<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> right

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
what you do is you just stick that right

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
what you do is you just stick that right
in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> nose<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> bait<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
in the nose of the bait and then you

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.830 
in the nose of the bait and then you
start<00:01:46.740> twisting<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> does<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
start twisting and what that does is it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
start twisting and what that does is it
just<00:01:48.869> locks<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.439> bait<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> place<00:01:50.040> keeps<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
just locks that bait in place keeps it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
just locks that bait in place keeps it
from<00:01:50.670> flying<00:01:51.000> off<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> fish<00:01:51.869> kicks<00:01:52.200> or

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
from flying off when the fish kicks or

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
from flying off when the fish kicks or
something<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> screwed<00:01:53.970> up

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
something like that kind of screwed up

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.209 
something like that kind of screwed up
on<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.960> right<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:55.979> still

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
on that but that's right it will still

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
on that but that's right it will still
stay<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.360> usually<00:01:57.540> screw<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> way

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
stay and I usually screw it all the way

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.030 
stay and I usually screw it all the way
until<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> gets<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.159> about<00:01:59.219> the<00:02:00.530> line<00:02:01.530> tie<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
until it gets to about the line tie of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.630 
until it gets to about the line tie of
the<00:02:02.070> hook<00:02:02.479> keep<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the hook keep going a little bit so that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
the hook keep going a little bit so that
that<00:02:05.969> bait<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.420> sure<00:02:06.600> isn't<00:02:06.869> gonna<00:02:06.960> fly<00:02:07.170> off

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that bait for sure isn't gonna fly off

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
that bait for sure isn't gonna fly off
so<00:02:07.649> once<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.250> turn<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.910> it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so once I do that I turn it back on it's

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780 
so once I do that I turn it back on it's
right<00:02:09.209> side<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> laminate<00:02:11.640> side

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
right side up so that the laminate side

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.960 
right side up so that the laminate side
is<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> bottom

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
is on on the bottom

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.890 
is on on the bottom
and<00:02:13.960> what<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.890> bend<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.250> back<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and what I do is I just bend it back and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.010 
and what I do is I just bend it back and
I<00:02:17.910> bring<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.060> through<00:02:19.180> kinda<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> wood<00:02:19.840> rig

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
I bring it through kinda like a wood rig

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.170 
I bring it through kinda like a wood rig
a<00:02:20.050> Texas<00:02:20.470> rig<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.640> lot<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.850> people<00:02:22.030> think

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
a Texas rig and a lot of people think

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.240 
a Texas rig and a lot of people think
this<00:02:22.270> hook<00:02:22.480> may<00:02:22.660> be<00:02:22.720> too<00:02:22.960> big<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:24.010> put

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
this hook may be too big but you put

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.600 
this hook may be too big but you put
these<00:02:24.960> put<00:02:25.960> these<00:02:26.110> big<00:02:26.590> swim<00:02:27.100> baits<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.550> a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
these put these big swim baits on a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.370 
these put these big swim baits on a
small<00:02:27.910> hook<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.780> won't<00:02:28.930> get<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> best

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
small hook and you won't get the best

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.010 
small hook and you won't get the best
hookup<00:02:29.680> ratios<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.220> them<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:31.240> because<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
hookup ratios on them just because the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.420 
hookup ratios on them just because the
big<00:02:32.170> hook<00:02:32.290> complements<00:02:32.890> these<00:02:32.980> darkstar

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
big hook complements these darkstar

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.220 
big hook complements these darkstar
baits<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.910> also<00:02:34.180> I'm<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.960> doing<00:02:35.110> a

baits and also I'm I just like doing a
bigger<00:02:35.410> hook<00:02:35.590> since<00:02:35.860> if<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.670> notice<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.060> is

bigger hook since if you notice this is

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.030 
bigger hook since if you notice this is
a<00:02:37.240> weightless<00:02:37.690> rig<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.620> bigger<00:02:38.860> hook

a weightless rig and the bigger hook

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.620 
a weightless rig and the bigger hook
adds<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> little<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.910> weight<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.330> a

got<00:05:53.679> a<00:05:53.709> really<00:05:53.919> collection<00:05:54.549> the<00:05:54.639> water<00:05:54.819> off<00:05:54.909> so

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:55.119 
got a really collection the water off so

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.649 
got a really collection the water off so
you<00:05:55.179> hear<00:05:55.329> a<00:05:55.360> little<00:05:55.599> bit<00:05:55.809> but<00:05:57.179> this<00:05:58.179> bait<00:05:58.419> he's

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
you hear a little bit but this bait he's

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.449 
you hear a little bit but this bait he's
got<00:05:58.839> a<00:05:58.869> lot<00:05:59.199> of<00:05:59.229> character<00:06:00.099> to<00:06:00.279> it

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:00.459 
got a lot of character to it

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.039 
got a lot of character to it
and<00:06:01.029> that's<00:06:01.209> why<00:06:01.299> I<00:06:01.329> really<00:06:01.479> like<00:06:01.719> it<00:06:01.929> and

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:02.049 
and that's why I really like it and

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:03.359 
and that's why I really like it and
again<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.409> bait<00:06:02.529> itself<00:06:02.889> is<00:06:03.009> pretty<00:06:03.129> heavy

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:03.369 
again the bait itself is pretty heavy

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.699 
again the bait itself is pretty heavy
too<00:06:03.610> so<00:06:03.879> I<00:06:04.179> tend<00:06:04.629> just<00:06:04.809> not<00:06:04.959> to<00:06:05.079> even<00:06:05.229> throw<00:06:05.439> it

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:05.709 
too so I tend just not to even throw it

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.089 
too so I tend just not to even throw it
on<00:06:05.829> up<00:06:06.039> on<00:06:06.399> a<00:06:07.089> weighted<00:06:07.539> I<00:06:08.349> like<00:06:08.769> throwing<00:06:08.949> it

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
on up on a weighted I like throwing it

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.459 
on up on a weighted I like throwing it
straight<00:06:09.159> up<00:06:09.339> and<00:06:09.789> it<00:06:10.779> produces<00:06:11.169> a<00:06:11.229> lot<00:06:11.439> of

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
straight up and it produces a lot of

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:12.749 
straight up and it produces a lot of
fish<00:06:11.769> that<00:06:11.979> way<00:06:12.189> too

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
fish that way too

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.809 
fish that way too
I<00:06:12.789> mean<00:06:13.749> if<00:06:13.839> you're<00:06:13.989> fishing<00:06:14.169> in<00:06:14.469> five<00:06:15.279> ten

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
I mean if you're fishing in five ten

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.759 
I mean if you're fishing in five ten
foot<00:06:16.089> plus<00:06:16.329> then<00:06:16.839> I<00:06:16.899> suggest<00:06:17.110> don't<00:06:17.469> a<00:06:17.559> swim

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:17.769 
foot plus then I suggest don't a swim

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:20.309 
foot plus then I suggest don't a swim
bait<00:06:17.860> on<00:06:18.189> it<00:06:18.219> but<00:06:18.459> again<00:06:18.489> that's<00:06:18.819> it<00:06:19.209> move<00:06:19.629> fast

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
bait on it but again that's it move fast

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.199 
bait on it but again that's it move fast
so<00:06:20.799> I<00:06:20.860> just<00:06:21.069> straight<00:06:21.309> up<00:06:21.339> sorrowed<00:06:21.729> you<00:06:22.089> know

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.209 
so I just straight up sorrowed you know

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.779
