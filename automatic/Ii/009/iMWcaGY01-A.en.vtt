00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
think would be college and up high

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.210 
think would be college and up high
school<00:03:09.820> could<00:03:10.510> could<00:03:10.959> wear<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.350> easily<00:03:12.010> if

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
school could could wear it easily if

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.580

you're<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.850> know<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.000> certain<00:03:13.270> type<00:03:13.660> but<00:03:14.350> I

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
you're you know a certain type but I

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.290

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
think collagen up is where this one's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.370 
think collagen up is where this one's
going<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.600> mainly<00:03:17.140> lie<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:18.340> season<00:03:19.380> this

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
going to mainly lie the season this

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.160 
going to mainly lie the season this
