happen all the time but reshoots also
happen<00:04:43.030> because<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:45.460> know<00:04:45.580> something<00:04:46.270> baby's

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600

not<00:04:46.780> good<00:04:46.990> enough<00:04:47.259> all<00:04:47.650> right<00:04:47.860> maybe<00:04:48.009> they

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
not good enough all right maybe they

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.270 
not good enough all right maybe they
screened<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.470> some<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.860> executives

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
screened it to some of the executives

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.980 
screened it to some of the executives
and<00:04:51.669> they<00:04:51.789> felt<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.210> there's<00:04:52.539> something

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
and they felt that there's something

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.960 
and they felt that there's something
missing<00:04:53.259> and<00:04:53.530> that's<00:04:53.740> why<00:04:53.979> they<00:04:54.220> gotta<00:04:54.400> tweak

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
missing and that's why they gotta tweak

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.090 
missing and that's why they gotta tweak
it<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.180> bit<00:04:55.210> by<00:04:55.509> doing<00:04:55.840> some<00:04:55.990> research<00:04:56.199> we<00:04:56.889> don't

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
it a bit by doing some research we don't

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.800 
it a bit by doing some research we don't
know<00:04:57.250> what<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.550> for<00:04:57.820> but<00:04:57.880> apparently<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.750> a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
know what it's for but apparently it's a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.210 
know what it's for but apparently it's a
three<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.110> four<00:04:59.289> days<00:04:59.350> shoot<00:04:59.830> which<00:05:00.039> is

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
three to four days shoot which is

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.790 
three to four days shoot which is
actually<00:05:00.669> cutting<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.330> close<00:05:01.510> because<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.470> mean

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
actually cutting it close because I mean

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
actually cutting it close because I mean
there's<00:05:03.070> only<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.310> few<00:05:03.490> months<00:05:03.639> of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
there's only a few months of

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.730 
there's only a few months of
post-production<00:05:04.150> work<00:05:04.660> left<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.169> they
