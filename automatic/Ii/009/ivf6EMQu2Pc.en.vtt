blah oh and a nice carrying case which
is<00:01:59.570> much<00:02:00.570> smaller<00:02:00.920> than<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> carrying<00:02:02.430> case

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
is much smaller than the carrying case

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.139 
is much smaller than the carrying case
for<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> ear<00:02:04.020> headphones<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:05.149> then

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
for the over the ear headphones and then

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.669 
for the over the ear headphones and then
of<00:02:06.299> course<00:02:06.329> um<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.710> got<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:09.110> little<00:02:10.110> string<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
of course um you got a little string I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.050 
of course um you got a little string I
think<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.129> case<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:11.910> more

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
think for the case and some more

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600 
think for the case and some more
adjustable<00:02:12.720> clip

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
adjustable clip

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.570 
adjustable clip
for<00:02:15.240> your<00:02:15.360> ear<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.560> good<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.550> can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
actually I think make them to where they

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.080 
actually I think make them to where they
this<00:02:19.800> latches<00:02:20.400> around<00:02:20.840> no<00:02:22.760> not<00:02:23.760> quite<00:02:23.880> sure

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
figure that out that's neat and then

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.570 
figure that out that's neat and then
some<00:02:28.080> more<00:02:28.260> um<00:02:28.580> adjustable<00:02:29.580> your<00:02:29.790> pieces<00:02:30.170> so
