00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
kind of a cute funny image but actually

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.090

as a kind of logo or something that we
can<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.460> use<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.950> calling<00:01:50.430> card<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can really use to as a calling card and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.810 
can really use to as a calling card and
