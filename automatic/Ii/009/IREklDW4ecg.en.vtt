00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:54.579 
this rom actually does and why it's very

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:56.039 
this rom actually does and why it's very
nice<00:05:54.819> and<00:05:54.879> that's<00:05:55.119> why<00:05:55.389> it's<00:05:55.839> my<00:05:56.019> favorite

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:56.049 
nice and that's why it's my favorite

00:05:56.049 --> 00:06:01.639 
nice and that's why it's my favorite
rhyme<00:05:56.499> so<00:05:56.799> far<00:05:57.009> made<00:05:57.159> for<00:05:57.369> any<00:05:57.519> android<00:05:57.819> phone

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:01.649 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:04.649 

alright<00:06:02.649> so<00:06:02.949> in<00:06:03.099> just<00:06:03.369> a<00:06:03.519> couple<00:06:03.939> more<00:06:04.209> seconds

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
alright so in just a couple more seconds

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.109 
alright so in just a couple more seconds
to<00:06:04.839> restart<00:06:05.549> usually<00:06:06.549> it<00:06:06.610> takes<00:06:06.639> a<00:06:06.939> little

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:07.119 
to restart usually it takes a little

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:09.389 
to restart usually it takes a little
longer<00:06:07.329> just<00:06:07.659> goes<00:06:07.899> the<00:06:08.079> first<00:06:08.319> boo<00:06:08.799> on<00:06:09.069> this

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:09.399 
longer just goes the first boo on this

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.569 
longer just goes the first boo on this
rom<00:06:09.639> so<00:06:10.289> it<00:06:11.289> should<00:06:11.559> use<00:06:11.649> you<00:06:11.769> to<00:06:11.919> be<00:06:12.099> a<00:06:12.129> lot

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:12.579 
rom so it should use you to be a lot

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:13.829 
rom so it should use you to be a lot
quicker<00:06:12.729> than<00:06:13.029> what<00:06:13.209> it's<00:06:13.329> taking<00:06:13.719> right<00:06:13.809> now

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
quicker than what it's taking right now

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:26.450 
quicker than what it's taking right now
so<00:06:14.259> let's<00:06:14.409> just<00:06:14.529> wait<00:06:14.649> for<00:06:14.769> this<00:06:14.829> to<00:06:14.889> go

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.550 

alright<00:06:27.150> so<00:06:27.389> here's<00:06:27.600> the<00:06:27.750> new<00:06:28.020> bootloader

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
this is my bootloader so it's actually

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.050 
this is my bootloader so it's actually
pretty<00:06:31.289> nice<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.220> can't<00:06:32.460> change<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:32.880> if

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060
