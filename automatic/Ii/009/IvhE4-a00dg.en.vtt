00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.290
 the 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.420
 How about people from the mangueta and good 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.070
 youtube in general today I'm going to 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.379
 make this little video as always 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.139
 lasts a little bit about this plugin that is 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.280
 llama charles I leave the link in the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.710
 description obviously if you 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.170
 they want to download it and use it on their server or 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.240
 they just want to know more about him 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 be the link that is in the description and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.700
 good what this plugin is about 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.860
 simple good 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.480
 as you can see here this looks like a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.960
 chair not really the only thing this 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 it's some stairs that and a sign 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.890
 of these good two of those ok but 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.630
 someone came up with good if I put him 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.070
 on the sides like it looks like a little chair 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.710
 no and the truth is that it does seem like a 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 chair and good this plugin what the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.890
 person who is plug in said good if 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.140
 this looks like a chair because it does not 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.210
 a chair that works and then now 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.460
 we can just crouch near 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.790
 the chair with nothing in your hand we click 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.190
 right and boom we sit down and it looks very 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.690
 very father the truth is that it looks very 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.640
 funny I do not know why I love it and I 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.820
 I'm focusing every time just because I 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.890
 love how it looks not then well 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.200
 it's like how the plugin works 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.840
 with all the stairs good 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.210
 in this case all the chairs and good 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.990
 Well, as you can see, there is bread without 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.119
 sitting down then we can do it not only 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 from one to two or from four 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.759
 but by force you always have to have the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.259
 next sign has to have the east 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.329
 side does not matter if they put text on it 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.450
 but obviously it will be better without text 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.719
 and well it can be up to four and so 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.860
 it's going to work the same, we do not bend over 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.369
 this one we have to be three cubes 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.590
 minimum of this to leave us 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.380
 sit down and as you can see there then already 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.569
 I'm sitting, I'm not in an armchair 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.959
 as well as four people there alone 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.939
 and well I'm alone anything else you 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.649
 I was wondering it was good if you can 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.060
 do four because you could not 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.610
 do for example 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.579
 so good many people usually do 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 well your armchairs or your rooms 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.850
 then I said will be able the answer is 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.319
 yes and you can not really but 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.959
 you can only make it work 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.489
 one of those armchairs or we can put 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.130
 here and make an armchair like 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.040
 double and then we add here the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.800
 third armchair only that that third armchair 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 well this third aggregate space is not going 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.930
 to work will only work with this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 and with that will not work either, nothing 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.360
 more is going to work with this then 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.940
 we crouched down we sat down and ready not and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 well one more thing obviously do not go 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.739
 to be able to sit on this over someone 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.630
 where there is already someone and if we try 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.209
 is going to tell us that you want to sit 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.890
 on the legs of bread if then 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.170
 truth this plugin is very very good 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.239
 besides making the chairs decorative 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.000
 in your home now you can also serve 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.910
 as chairs chairs then I would like them 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.920
 I highly recommend that this bus do 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.349
 his little chairs in his house and 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.450
 and put it do not invite people and they feel 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.819
 if they make videos then do them as well 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.370
 sitting down does not look very father in the end 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.410
 I hope that you like them 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.120
 this plugin if I repeat them if they want it 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.580
 get off or they want to know more about him or something 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.890
 so the link is in the description like this 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.709
 as for any plugin that is that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.730
 have in maine then it leaves you 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.340
 that is all 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.340
 I'm reindeer and then here I say goodbye bye
