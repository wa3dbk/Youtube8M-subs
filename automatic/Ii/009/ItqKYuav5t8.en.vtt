what can we do about it the first thing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.490 
what can we do about it the first thing
to<00:00:41.969> understand<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.350> multiple

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to understand is that there are multiple

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
to understand is that there are multiple
layers<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> nose<00:00:44.520> whether<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.510> being<00:00:45.719> the

bone the cartilage and the soft tissue

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
bone the cartilage and the soft tissue
and<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.570> whenever<00:00:48.870> those<00:00:49.530> tissues<00:00:50.039> are

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and and whenever those tissues are

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
and and whenever those tissues are

after<00:01:06.510> surgery<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.420> swelling

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
after surgery and that that swelling

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
after surgery and that that swelling
gradually<00:01:11.610> goes<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.260> we<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> think

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
gradually goes down we like to think

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.390 
gradually goes down we like to think
that<00:01:14.420> swelling<00:01:15.420> goes<00:01:15.960> goes<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that swelling goes goes down and is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.240 
that swelling goes goes down and is
completed<00:01:17.970> about<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> year<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:20.070> in

completed about a year or so but in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
completed about a year or so but in

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that swelling can last longer so people

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.710 
that swelling can last longer so people
want<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.479> that

at night it's very frustrating for some
people<00:02:13.660> because<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.170> swelling<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
people because that swelling is just a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.339 
people because that swelling is just a
result<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.520> having<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.000> surgery<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.959> the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
result of having the surgery and and the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.440 
result of having the surgery and and the
characteristics<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.160> their<00:02:18.250> skin<00:02:18.580> sometimes

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
characteristics of their skin sometimes

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
characteristics of their skin sometimes
don't<00:02:19.959> lend<00:02:20.200> themselves<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.830> rapid

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
don't lend themselves to that rapid

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
don't lend themselves to that rapid
recovery<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.349> main<00:02:23.620> thing<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
recovery but the main thing is to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.559 
recovery but the main thing is to
understand<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.790> swelling<00:02:25.120> will<00:02:25.420> go

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
understand that that swelling will go

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.600 
understand that that swelling will go
away<00:02:25.810> there<00:02:26.380> are<00:02:26.410> things<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:27.069> can<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
away there are things that we can do to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.920 
away there are things that we can do to
make<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:28.030> better<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:29.560> not<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.040> rush<00:02:30.250> into<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
make it better but not to rush into the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.210 
make it better but not to rush into the
the<00:02:31.930> thought<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.470> need<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.040> that

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the thought that you need to have that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.250 
the thought that you need to have that
nose<00:02:33.819> redone<00:02:34.300> because<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.810> really<00:02:35.019> need<00:02:35.170> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
nose redone because you really need to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.170 
nose redone because you really need to
wait<00:02:35.769> about<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.980> year<00:02:36.280> or<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.550> until<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:37.030> see

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
wait about a year or so until we see

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.940 
wait about a year or so until we see
that<00:02:37.300> swelling<00:02:37.630> go<00:02:37.750> down<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> main<00:02:38.739> thing

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that swelling go down but the main thing

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.259 
that swelling go down but the main thing
is<00:02:38.980> communication<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.700> your<00:02:39.849> plastic

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269
