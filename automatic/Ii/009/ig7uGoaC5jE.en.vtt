00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.320
 Now we will show you how 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:18.840
 connect xenon its performance 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 so take the ignition and standing for now 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 get out of here so the lamp itself 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:47.340
 plug connectors all dad mom is very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 just connect connect so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 as we do not have scooters 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.610
 we will show you the work of xenon with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.610
 using a simple ordinary battery 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.450
 nothing complicated in it no these two 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.950
 the wires go to the control button 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.010
 headlights on 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.010
 since we don't have them, we connect 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.750
 immediately direct them in order to 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.750
 show you how it works 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.549
 in principle, the whole scheme is now assembled 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:59.549
 it remains only to connect to 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:04.590
 battery cream plus and minus 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.590
 so let's roll over what was vernon 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.470
 you can turn off the light in order to be 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:33.959
 better seen xenon 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:46.640
