personally not that experienced in the
area<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.789> flash<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:11.129> we'll<00:02:11.280> move<00:02:11.400> along<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
area of flash so we'll move along to the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.610 
area of flash so we'll move along to the
next<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.239> evie<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.930> confidence

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
next one evie it's confidence

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.270 
next one evie it's confidence
station<00:02:14.040> what<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.150> useful<00:02:15.569> for

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
station what that is is it's useful for

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
station what that is is it's useful for
AV<00:02:17.280> mode<00:02:17.549> which<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.299> here<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.750> aperture

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
AV mode which is up here that's aperture

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.500 
AV mode which is up here that's aperture
priority<00:02:19.620> which<00:02:20.430> means<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.030> control<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
priority which means you can control the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.180 
priority which means you can control the
aperture<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.409> everything<00:02:22.830> else<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
aperture and then everything else is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.580 
aperture and then everything else is
done<00:02:23.370> by<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.610> camera<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.409> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
done by the camera what that is is that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.550 
done by the camera what that is is that
well<00:02:25.890> when<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.489> adjust<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.060> e<00:02:27.090> V<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.989> adjusts

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
well when you adjust the e V it adjusts

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.979 
well when you adjust the e V it adjusts
the<00:02:28.709> shutter<00:02:28.980> speed<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.879> down<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.750> will

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the shutter speed if you go down it will

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.479 
the shutter speed if you go down it will
adjust<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.500> shutter<00:02:31.709> speed<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.190> quicker

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
adjust the shutter speed to be quicker

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.550 
adjust the shutter speed to be quicker
and<00:02:32.700> give<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.030> darker<00:02:33.450> image<00:02:33.629> if<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> go<00:02:34.379> up

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and give you a darker image if you go up

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.259 
and give you a darker image if you go up
it'll<00:02:35.099> adjust<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> shutter<00:02:35.730> speed<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.120> be

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
it'll adjust the shutter speed to be

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.149 
it'll adjust the shutter speed to be
slower<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.780> therefore<00:02:37.170> give<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> brighter

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
slower and therefore give you a brighter

800<00:04:13.470> will<00:04:13.980> get<00:04:14.160> rid<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.340> some<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:14.730> noise

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
800 will get rid of some of that noise

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.830 
800 will get rid of some of that noise
then<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.669> got<00:04:17.849> some<00:04:18.060> other<00:04:18.239> things<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.750> you

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
then you got some other things that you

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
then you got some other things that you
can<00:04:18.989> do<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:19.349> here<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.709> have<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:20.010> do<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
can do in here that have to do with the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.110 
can do in here that have to do with the
AF<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.239> whatnot<00:04:22.219> not<00:04:23.219> necessarily<00:04:24.000> as

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
AF and whatnot not necessarily as

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.230 
AF and whatnot not necessarily as

important as the other
things<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:27.099> then<00:04:27.220> finally<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.699> can<00:04:27.880> make

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
things and then finally you can make

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.570 
things and then finally you can make
your<00:04:28.240> own<00:04:28.419> menu<00:04:28.720> sort<00:04:29.590> your<00:04:29.830> items<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.460> make

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
your own menu sort your items and make

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.689 
your own menu sort your items and make
it<00:04:30.729> easier<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.599> to<00:04:31.750> find<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.740> functions

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
it easier for you to find the functions

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.469 
it easier for you to find the functions
that<00:04:33.880> you<00:04:33.970> use<00:04:34.240> most<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:35.319> info<00:04:35.650> button<00:04:35.919> here

camera and if we go over here one thing
that<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.120> really<00:04:49.599> like<00:04:49.750> about<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:50.199> camera<00:04:50.889> is

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
that I really like about this camera is

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.499 
that I really like about this camera is
even<00:04:51.370> though<00:04:51.490> it's<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.699> beginner<00:04:52.000> model<00:04:52.300> has<00:04:52.479> a

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
even though it's a beginner model has a

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.120 
even though it's a beginner model has a
lot<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.960> controls<00:04:53.349> on<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.590> outside<00:04:53.949> as<00:04:54.069> you
