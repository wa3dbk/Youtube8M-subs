I<00:01:54.509> typically<00:01:54.899> would<00:01:55.470> only<00:01:55.710> suggest<00:01:56.340> doing

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
I typically would only suggest doing

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
I typically would only suggest doing
this<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.030> either<00:01:57.210> domination<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.530> hard

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.789 
point because in hard point running
through<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> middle<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
through the middle you can get to that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
through the middle you can get to that
first<00:02:02.040> hard<00:02:02.280> point<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.670> domination<00:02:03.420> running

first hard point in domination running
through<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.350> middle<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
through the middle you can get to be

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.289 
through the middle you can get to be
done<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.460> other<00:02:05.610> than<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.909> there's<00:02:06.149> really

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
done but other than that there's really

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.359 
done but other than that there's really
no<00:02:06.420> reason<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.950> yourself<00:02:08.280> at

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
no reason to do that you put yourself at

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.710 
no reason to do that you put yourself at
a<00:02:08.399> lot<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> risk<00:02:08.819> there's<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> ways<00:02:09.509> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
a lot of risk there's a lot of ways that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510 
a lot of risk there's a lot of ways that
enemies<00:02:09.959> could<00:02:10.110> shoot<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> kill<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
enemies could shoot you and kill you so

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.440 
enemies could shoot you and kill you so
I<00:02:11.550> only<00:02:11.940> use<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.720> hard<00:02:12.930> pointer

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I only use that in hard pointer

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.660 
I only use that in hard pointer
nation<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:14.739> finally<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.400> could<00:02:15.580> go

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
nation and and then finally you could go

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
nation and and then finally you could go
to<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> left<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.569> if<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.810> want<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.050> rush<00:02:17.290> the

to the left so if you want to rush the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.920 
to the left so if you want to rush the
side<00:02:17.830> flank<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.940> actually<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.330> very<00:02:19.629> very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
side flank this is actually a very very

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.479 
side flank this is actually a very very
good<00:02:20.050> option<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.470> like<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.800> lot<00:02:20.920> because<00:02:21.160> you

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
good option I like it a lot because you

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.400 
good option I like it a lot because you
have<00:02:21.670> way<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.300> way<00:02:22.599> more<00:02:22.629> cover<00:02:23.110> than<00:02:23.349> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
have way way way more cover than the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.110 
have way way way more cover than the
enemy<00:02:23.650> team<00:02:23.830> does<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.519> can<00:02:24.700> use<00:02:24.879> this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
enemy team does you can use this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940 
enemy team does you can use this
sideways<00:02:25.690> chair<00:02:26.050> right<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.500> cover<00:02:26.709> or

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
sideways chair right here as cover or

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.949 
sideways chair right here as cover or
you<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.670> move<00:02:27.819> up<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> crouch<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.690> stairs

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
you can move up and crouch on the stairs

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.720 
you can move up and crouch on the stairs
and<00:02:29.230> use<00:02:29.379> that<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.739> cover<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.130> that's<00:02:30.340> just

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and use that as cover and that's just

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.220 
and use that as cover and that's just
it's<00:02:31.060> huge<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.750> no<00:02:31.900> cover<00:02:32.110> at

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
it's huge because they have no cover at

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's huge because they have no cover at
all<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.800> have<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> ton<00:02:33.220> you're<00:02:33.430> gonna<00:02:33.550> be<00:02:33.670> able

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
to take them out with no problem now

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
to take them out with no problem now
over<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.040> other<00:02:36.310> side<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.730> things<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.239> you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
over on the other side of things if you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.140 
over on the other side of things if you
spawn<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> top<00:02:38.230> side<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.590> map

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
spawn on the a top side of the map

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.490 
spawn on the a top side of the map
obviously<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.299> what<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.569> just<00:02:40.599> saw<00:02:40.930> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
obviously with what we just saw you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.930 
obviously with what we just saw you
don't<00:02:41.739> want<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.040> rush<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.400> side<00:02:42.610> flank

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
don't want to rush the side flank

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.339 
don't want to rush the side flank
because<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.480> enemy<00:02:43.810> team<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.049> going<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.290> have

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
because the enemy team is going to have

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.960 
because the enemy team is going to have
the<00:02:44.590> cover<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:45.160> won't<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.519> any<00:02:45.760> you're

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the cover you won't have any you're

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.070 
the cover you won't have any you're
gonna<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.269> sitting<00:02:46.569> duck<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.989> you'll

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
gonna be a sitting duck and you'll

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320 
gonna be a sitting duck and you'll
probably<00:02:47.170> be<00:02:47.440> taken<00:02:47.769> out<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:47.920> again<00:02:48.910> kind<00:02:49.269> of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
probably be taken out now again kind of

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.300 
probably be taken out now again kind of
like<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.690> first<00:02:49.870> side<00:02:50.140> if<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.769> want<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.130> rush

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
like the first side if you want to rush

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.710 
like the first side if you want to rush
straight<00:02:51.549> up<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.819> middle<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.690> I

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
straight up the middle you can but I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.660 
straight up the middle you can but I
would<00:02:52.900> only<00:02:52.930> suggest<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.739> for<00:02:53.769> domination<00:02:54.459> or

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
would only suggest it for domination or

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.030 
would only suggest it for domination or
for<00:02:55.480> hardpoint<00:02:56.079> again<00:02:56.440> because<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.829> can<00:02:56.950> get

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
for hardpoint again because you can get

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.009 
for hardpoint again because you can get
to<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.250> first<00:02:57.459> objective<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:58.930> then

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
to that first objective and and then

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.509 
to that first objective and and then
finally<00:02:59.470> what<00:02:59.709> are<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.829> left<00:02:59.980> with<00:03:00.250> well<00:03:00.489> you

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
finally what are you left with well you

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.580 
finally what are you left with well you
can<00:03:00.819> rush<00:03:01.030> left<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.599> that<00:03:01.810> little<00:03:02.200> lounge<00:03:02.410> area

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
can rush left to that little lounge area

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.380 
can rush left to that little lounge area
which<00:03:03.130> as<00:03:03.310> we<00:03:03.489> previously<00:03:03.730> discussed<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
which as we previously discussed is

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.750 
which as we previously discussed is
equal<00:03:04.870> with<00:03:05.049> both<00:03:05.260> sides<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.829> typically<00:03:06.670> on

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
equal with both sides so typically on

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
equal with both sides so typically on
the<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.849> top<00:03:07.090> side<00:03:07.360> your<00:03:07.810> best<00:03:08.079> bet<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.590> run

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
the a top side your best bet is to run

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.920 
the a top side your best bet is to run
to<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.130> left<00:03:09.340> now<00:03:09.610> what<00:03:10.299> are<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:10.510> forgetting

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
here you know we covered the three ways

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.430 
here you know we covered the three ways
that<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.390> go<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.630> top<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.079> map<00:03:14.230> what

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that you can go on top of the map what

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.470 
that you can go on top of the map what
are<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:14.650> forgetting<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.670> bottom<00:03:16.180> that's

straight<00:03:24.519> underground<00:03:24.970> because<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:25.959> so

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560

so good
it's<00:03:27.609> almost<00:03:27.910> like<00:03:28.299> everybody<00:03:28.630> forgets<00:03:29.290> that

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
it's almost like everybody forgets that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's almost like everybody forgets that
that<00:03:29.680> underground<00:03:30.069> is<00:03:30.250> there<00:03:30.400> at<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.609> start

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
that underground is there at the start

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.979 
that underground is there at the start
of<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.910> map<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.180> they're<00:03:31.389> too<00:03:31.569> concerned

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
of the map because they're too concerned

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.539 
of the map because they're too concerned
with<00:03:32.230> getting<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.650> first<00:03:32.950> kill<00:03:33.220> or<00:03:33.400> getting

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
with getting that first kill or getting

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.250 
with getting that first kill or getting
to<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.790> objective<00:03:34.359> or<00:03:34.480> whatever<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.959> is<00:03:35.049> and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
to the objective or whatever it is and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.440 
to the objective or whatever it is and
usually<00:03:35.829> it's<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.579> clear<00:03:36.880> path<00:03:37.180> right

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
usually it's just a clear path right

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.879 
usually it's just a clear path right
under<00:03:37.630> there<00:03:37.780> now<00:03:37.810> sometimes<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.620> might<00:03:38.769> have

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
under there now sometimes you might have

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.099 
under there now sometimes you might have
to<00:03:39.040> kill<00:03:39.190> one<00:03:39.220> guy<00:03:39.609> but<00:03:40.299> usually<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:40.959> can<00:03:41.079> just

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
to kill one guy but usually you can just

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.599 
to kill one guy but usually you can just
go<00:03:41.350> straight<00:03:41.680> under<00:03:41.950> there<00:03:42.069> come<00:03:42.340> up<00:03:42.459> behind

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
kills run upstairs and start spawn

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.840 
kills run upstairs and start spawn
killing<00:03:47.079> that's<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.799> crazy<00:03:48.160> how<00:03:48.489> easy

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
killing that's just it's crazy how easy

killing that's just it's crazy how easy
it<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.480> get<00:03:49.569> off<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> good<00:03:50.079> start<00:03:50.319> on<00:03:50.470> this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
it is to get off to a good start on this

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.620 
it is to get off to a good start on this
map<00:03:50.769> when<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.489> go<00:03:51.639> underground<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.389> make<00:03:52.600> sure

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
map when you go underground so make sure

there first with the enemy team you can

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.360 
there first with the enemy team you can
go<00:04:36.410> towards<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.740> middle<00:04:36.950> but<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.100> would<00:04:37.220> only

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
go towards the middle but I would only

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.920 
go towards the middle but I would only
do<00:04:37.640> that<00:04:37.670> if<00:04:37.970> you're<00:04:38.120> playing<00:04:38.300> hard<00:04:38.510> point<00:04:38.780> or

do that if you're playing hard point or

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.330 
do that if you're playing hard point or
domination<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.890> can<00:04:40.010> get<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.220> those

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
domination so you can get to those

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.310 
domination so you can get to those
objectives<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.780> then<00:04:41.870> finally<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.260> can

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
objectives and and then finally you can

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.930 
objectives and and then finally you can
rush<00:04:42.530> left<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.130> side<00:04:43.280> flank<00:04:43.610> because<00:04:43.850> you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
rush left to the side flank because you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.220 
rush left to the side flank because you
