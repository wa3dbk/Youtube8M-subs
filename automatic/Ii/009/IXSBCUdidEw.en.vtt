00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.820
 with the people back this 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.890
 this video was recorded that was before the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.300
 patch that they threw this week and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.430
 before they have invited 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.460
 additional 2500 people 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.110
 this as you can see they had increased a 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.660
 additional patch after the last 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.780
 video that I made that as you can see 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.470
 worsened the situation instead of fixing 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 things ended up breaking the east 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.250
 obviously veto things but if they go to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 put a patch to fix something 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.320
 because they end up breaking everything 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 nor the younger age 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.720
 well this as you can see is all 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.160
 half ugly you can not play very well that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.160
 let's say in some parts 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.200
 but what is going to be done 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.200
 follow him 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.520
 you do not see anything anymore, no more no 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 more circling exploring by watching 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 see how much it affects the cubes because 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.450
 they are everywhere 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 they are everywhere 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.530
 let's see no factors 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.130
 We decided to run and I left the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.140
 rosita 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.140
 let's see what else I find 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.220
 more he quotes more cubes and how can you see 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.750
 like they disappear when one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.690
 change the angle of the camera a little 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 but for the most part it will be fine 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.200
 they stay there and they no longer cover this with 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.960
 this patch that fanned there are a lot 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520
 of guided things not the most not the most 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.380
 these sections that are looking here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.090
 now this one 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.090
 why else do we teach them here 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 but I did not find one because it serves me 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.250
 I do not know if he serves me I did not want to serve 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.900
 I see nothing 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.700
 where they give 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.110
 it means that they do not receive would be 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.570
 many, but 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.430
 the truth then there is nothing else in 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.210
 signs because at that time the only 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 area that is available is this the 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.890
 first in an agreement as it is called was 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.890
 a troll or dying 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.770
 as you can see it having the slopes 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.770
 no way 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.090
 as I was telling you is the area 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.340
 remains no more restricted to this first 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.750
 area and up to the tip until this week 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.700
 that just happened this Tuesday that happened 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.700
 being the what 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.980
 the 10 seems to play when sitting on 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.330
 the last patch there will be a next 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.330
 area but 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.510
 in this event I also have videos of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.630
 to come out of here to tell you 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.630
 the truth 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.360
 but apart from the video here also this 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.120
 month I have some images that I took that is 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.430
 basically the most most box plus bugs 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.709
 more problems more 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.680
 in the combat so they told me 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.780
 they wanted me to show them how they were 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.400
 those of the tps 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.330
 it's what tps tells me and there was a place 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 the wave because half battling giving 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.700
 that avenue turned around 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.860
 as you can see there is here I show you this 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:15.220
 the picture that is what they see there according to 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.410
 in the position of running is a corpse 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 what games are the corpses up to 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.190
 they run or die and here also apart from 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 that we have them in epc s I do not know if what 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.840
 can see I have not selected 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.240
 present double ulna that is ulna with 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.530
 white and blue squares that is one in 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.370
 epc that was working before but and 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.000
 then here this image we have demons 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:47.020
 shooting rainbow and more cubes 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.020
 and more cubes 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:56.059
 more course here in this part was my 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.190
 first try to make a this one over 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.350
 instance 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.900
 but at the time the client was 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.880
 having many problems 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.740
 that apart from that apart from me too 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.370
 apparently as you can see the tank 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.039
 has a madman who is sitting there 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.850
 tank is the eternal the client had well 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.850
 ortho for home 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 so it's also that I was doing 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.950
 a big problem of tablecloth beta and 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.190
 after a while finally 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:32.740
 we can consume more people but not 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.590
 we wait for you with about 10-15 minutes 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.770
 signed that he could return entered 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.910
 as three steps and not disconnect a 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.860
 pain 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.040
 you have to disconnect it but 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.610
 thunders and finally they took for 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.610
 expired 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.080
 and we get more people and started 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.650
 through at this moment is telling you 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.650
 how to hitler 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.580
 and as you can see there are quotas within the 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.580
 this instance also 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.060
 let's go giles 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.600
 let's go with the blue 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.949
 it's a combination I feel like it 's like 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.960
 between a combination of noise and 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.710
 samÃ¡n 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.979
 I will explain later in another video 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.979
 why 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.630
 after this 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.630
 kick dance 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.390
 Our not the customer 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.070
 here 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.910
 I thundered the beggar client lasts 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.530
 frozen for ten minutes and then 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.919
 I did not have it, it can not be anything more than 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.070
 write a ticket and send it and ask 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.070
 help
