00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
over the past couple years to really

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
refreshed approach to the team I think

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.709

considering<00:02:47.219> we<00:02:47.459> we<00:02:47.849> we<00:02:48.209> don't<00:02:48.329> really<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.689> a

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
considering we we we don't really have a

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.199 
considering we we we don't really have a
natural<00:02:49.230> right-sided<00:02:49.799> player<00:02:50.129> who's<00:02:51.030> been

fair<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:38.729> we<00:03:38.849> start<00:03:39.180> Walker<00:03:39.509> in<00:03:39.599> this<00:03:39.720> game

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
fair that we start Walker in this game

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.780
