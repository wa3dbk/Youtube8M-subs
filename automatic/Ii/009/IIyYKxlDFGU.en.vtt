"Popular D.J Music for Parties

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.690
First figure out what kind of party it is
that you're getting booked to spin.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.889
And what is it that they want to hear.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.630
It can range, old music, new music
everything in between.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.240
So you definitely have to understand what
crowd you're

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.630
going to face.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.349
If it's a top forty commercial club.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.850
What the age range is like
you know, twenty one to like twenty six or

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.570
twenty seven.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.080
I'm not going to play
anything that's too old that they might not

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.350
remember or they might not know about
Even though, I will try to incorporate some

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.440
music that I feel that they should
know about.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.060
But I'll try to usually keep it current because
that's what they want

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.060
to hear.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.140
So whatever is on the radio you can pretty
much more or less try to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.610
track those songs down.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.171
You can also go on line and check on various
sites.

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.310
I pretty much do all of the above.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.980
I'm like always searching, trying to stay
on

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.150
top of it all.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.330
And asking my fellow D.J friends ""hey what
are you playing right now, what's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.260
popular in the clubs right now""?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.200
That I might not know about or just haven't
heard yet.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950
You can also try to build relationships with
people from various

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.950
record labels.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.010
Now days it's a lot easier, you can pretty
much just have them

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.229
e-mail promo copies of songs that haven't
really broke the charts yet.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.119
That are
going to require some time to become really,

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.119
really popular.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.860
But you know they're
on their way

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.960
No two parties are the same so definitely
keep that in mind.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.270
What ever worked
for your last party may not necessarily work

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.370
for the next party.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.320
So you don't
want to get in to a routine.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.760
You don't want people to predict what the
next

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.950
record is going to be."
