00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.729
 Hello everyone, you have a day with the name Kim and we 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.740
 continue to discuss the right questions 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.860
 food for all people leading active 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.440
 lifestyle and today finally came 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.900
 time to make a sports cocktail 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.240
 we are used to thinking that if 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 cocktail sports tone and naturally 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.660
 should be less tasty than a cocktail 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.090
 not sports so here I am today 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.220
 I will try to dispel these prejudices 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.840
 because friends will share with you 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.820
 history now during the winter holidays 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.710
 in california i came to the gym 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 fitness club did not come alone with 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.590
 Victoria Yushkevich 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.680
 and suddenly we see the unreal at the entrance 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.750
 revival happens to be happening 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.520
 cocktail tasting and the people they 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.829
 they practice there somehow 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.020
 cooking share their recipes with 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.879
 possible cocktails are added 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.710
 protein mixtures any 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.350
 vegetables and fruits are still some 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.879
 some kind of additives we naturally before 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 than start to train let's all this 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.149
 do and thicken and just we 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.980
 try this cocktail 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.600
 here you guys today i want to share with 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.159
 this recipe you hope that you 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.079
 like well and naturally I will 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.889
 I expect your comments 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.700
 positive and so i will use 

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:11.240
 frozen raspberries and frozen 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 strawberries 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.179
 under 150 grams of frozen form further 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.859
 orange juice is not a glass of half a glass 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.679
 I will add water to you 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.090
 I wanted to say about raspberries and strawberries 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.259
 discovery for me by the way I mean used to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.359
 consider that naturally this other 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.150
 fruit and rich fructose like 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.880
 it turned out in 10 grams of carbohydrates 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.430
 which prayer is present 4 grams 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 fiber and not digested that is 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.680
 that's what makes raspberries really 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.200
 for sports extremely useful product 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.540
 plus carbohydrates on themselves a little that is 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 Here in the amount of 150 grams 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.650
 frozen raspberry oven please note 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.780
 that is, water is present here 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.450
 contains only 10 12 grams 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.800
 carbohydrates here are a little more than strawberries 15 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.170
 grams of carbohydrates half a glass 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.330
 orange juice at 125 milliliters 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 it will be used somewhere else 12 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.920
 grams of carbohydrates and that we have 12 12 24 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 and 1539 round turns 40 grams 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.240
 carbohydrates let's cook and so 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.740
 orange juice is now a moment so 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.680
 half measured see the second 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.920
 half topped up with purified water half 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.620
 juice half water poured raspberries 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.630
 strawberry measuring spoon functional 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.040
 power supply 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 what does functional nutrition mean 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.600
 I think you do not need to explain this mixture 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.310
 proteins and carbohydrates with the addition of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.530
 vitamins of all kinds of minerals 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.780
 useful components that are needed 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.989
 a person practicing 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.800
 further measuring spoon of whey 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.959
 protein is also I think you all 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.430
 trainees do not need to explain but 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.239
 friends and now the most responsible 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.239
 moment 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.180

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.380

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.880

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.430

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.600
