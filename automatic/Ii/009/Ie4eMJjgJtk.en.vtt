00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
is a crazy amount of power storage I

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.030 
is a crazy amount of power storage I
found<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:39.270> on<00:02:39.420> an<00:02:39.569> average<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:40.470> an<00:02:40.800> average

could go on three plane trips to Japan
anyway<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.930> lot<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.319> power<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.310> great

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
anyway it's a lot of power it's a great

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
anyway it's a lot of power it's a great
amount<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.030> power<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:00.750> than<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
