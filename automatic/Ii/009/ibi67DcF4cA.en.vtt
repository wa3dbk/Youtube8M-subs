00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.550 
more butter all right I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.300> give<00:02:08.450> them<00:02:08.539> another<00:02:08.899> flip<00:02:11.560> going

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
ahead and give them another flip going

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.180 
ahead and give them another flip going
to<00:02:12.620> fly<00:02:12.800> some<00:02:13.069> more<00:02:13.160> butter<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.819> side

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
to fly some more butter to this side

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.680 
to fly some more butter to this side
they're<00:02:16.190> getting<00:02:16.430> really<00:02:16.940> close<00:02:17.209> starting<00:02:17.630> to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
they're getting really close starting to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.270 
they're getting really close starting to
flake<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.590> little<00:02:18.769> piece<00:02:19.010> they're

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
flake up that little piece they're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.850 
flake up that little piece they're
separated<00:02:20.060> tells<00:02:20.780> me<00:02:21.080> they're<00:02:21.290> getting<00:02:21.620> done

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
separated tells me they're getting done

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.400 
separated tells me they're getting done
so<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.790> probably<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> last<00:02:24.080> application

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
so this is probably the last application

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.340 
so this is probably the last application
of<00:02:25.069> butter<00:02:25.280> I'm<00:02:25.459> doing<00:02:25.930> I'm<00:02:26.930> gonna<00:02:27.110> let<00:02:27.200> these

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
of butter I'm doing I'm gonna let these

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.539 
of butter I'm doing I'm gonna let these
go<00:02:27.530> probably<00:02:28.220> around<00:02:28.430> 25<00:02:29.060> minutes<00:02:29.330> 30<00:02:29.630> maybe

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
go probably around 25 minutes 30 maybe

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.780 
go probably around 25 minutes 30 maybe
and<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:31.850> we're<00:02:31.940> going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.150> be<00:02:32.209> done<00:02:33.790> okay

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
