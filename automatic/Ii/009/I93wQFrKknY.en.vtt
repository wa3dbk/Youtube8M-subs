coming out to you guys soon with you
know<00:03:26.130> running<00:03:26.460> on<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> server<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.090> everything

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
know running on a server and everything

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.170 
know running on a server and everything
but<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.100> guess<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.400> next<00:03:29.580> 22<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> guys

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
but I guess I can go next 22 you guys

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.030 
but I guess I can go next 22 you guys
now<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.450> reason<00:03:30.930> why<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.320> don't<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> port

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
now the reason why we don't have a port

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.900 
now the reason why we don't have a port
out<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.330> connects<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.080> because<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.610> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
out that connects is because you have to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
out that connects is because you have to
take<00:03:36.120> forest<00:03:36.570> keys<00:03:36.780> off<00:03:36.990> of<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.230> phone<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.770> when

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
take forest keys off of a phone and when

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.070 
take forest keys off of a phone and when
you<00:03:38.010> put<00:03:38.250> those<00:03:38.370> keys<00:03:38.670> on<00:03:38.910> more<00:03:39.120> than<00:03:39.300> four<00:03:40.050> or

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
you put those keys on more than four or

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.750 
you put those keys on more than four or
five<00:03:40.290> devices<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:41.040> will<00:03:41.130> blacklist<00:03:41.400> that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
five devices it will blacklist that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.520 
five devices it will blacklist that
phone<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.270> nobody<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.080> really<00:03:43.290> winning

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
phone so nobody is really winning

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.340 
phone so nobody is really winning
willing<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.250> blacklist<00:03:44.760> their<00:03:44.970> phones<00:03:45.270> we<00:03:46.200> did

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.620 
breaks a law I'm not going to go to jail
for<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:02.090> even<00:04:03.090> though<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.210> was<00:04:03.390> going<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.570> be

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
for that even though it was going to be

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.610 
for that even though it was going to be
on<00:04:03.720> my<00:04:03.810> server<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.200> everything<00:04:04.410> i'm<00:04:04.500> not

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
on my server and everything i'm not

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.620 
on my server and everything i'm not
going<00:04:04.740> to<00:04:04.770> go<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.950> jail<00:04:05.160> for<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.120> that's

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
going to go to jail for that so that's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.150 
going to go to jail for that so that's
why<00:04:06.780> we're<00:04:06.990> not<00:04:07.020> releasing<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.650> until<00:04:08.070> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
why we're not releasing it until I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.610 
why we're not releasing it until I
forest<00:04:08.490> jobber<00:04:08.760> comes<00:04:08.940> out<00:04:09.150> which<00:04:09.420> will<00:04:09.630> just

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
forest jobber comes out which will just

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.940 
forest jobber comes out which will just
make<00:04:10.740> things<00:04:11.130> completely<00:04:11.700> easier<00:04:12.650> we<00:04:13.650> believe

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
make things completely easier we believe

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.220 
make things completely easier we believe
when<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> forest<00:04:14.580> river<00:04:14.730> comes<00:04:15.030> out<00:04:15.240> what<00:04:16.109> we've

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
when a forest river comes out what we've

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.370 
when a forest river comes out what we've
been<00:04:16.350> told<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:18.060> can<00:04:18.330> generate<00:04:18.810> for

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
been told is that we can generate for

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.510 
been told is that we can generate for
its<00:04:19.500> keys<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.600> would<00:04:22.350> obviously<00:04:22.830> make<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
its keys so that would obviously make it

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.000 
its keys so that would obviously make it
to<00:04:23.610> where<00:04:23.730> you<00:04:24.060> guys<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.390> have<00:04:24.530> Siri<00:04:25.530> on<00:04:25.620> all
