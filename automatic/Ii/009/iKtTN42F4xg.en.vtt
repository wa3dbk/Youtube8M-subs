00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.780
 graciela montes the family of the hours 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.290
 the family of the rope was very close or 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.360
 at least far behind when the soda and 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.230
 Mary of the eyes had a whole 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.870
 spring day with a white aphrodite 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 long flexible electric and resistant 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.980
 and on that day they had not gone back to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.770
 pull apart 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.099
 the same thing had happened with juancho and with 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.360
 marita the children of juan and maría 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.990
 as soon as they were born they were taken out 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.900
 with all his life but with one 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.380
 it's not that hard to understand if one 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.080
 misses 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.310
 marita for example was tied to her 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.250
 mom to her dad and is to form a total of three 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.980
 white sheets new to the waist and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.460
 the same goes for juancho and with juan and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.460
 with marin 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 Of course it was not easy to accommodate so many 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.020
 beans was no danger of cookies 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.149
 tripping 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.520
 but over time I have come 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.770
 accustomed to always move with 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 prudence and never away 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 too 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.160
 for example when they sat at the table 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.160
 it was more or less like that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 and when they go to bed they go to sleep and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.640
 when they went for a walk on Sundays 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.390
 the morning 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.940
 those of Laso were experts in ties the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.900
 concrete area was not one but more 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.390
 of morondanga in a splendid single 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.850
 elastic and extensible 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.060
 so when juancho and marita were going to 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.190
 the school that was around the corner maría 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 he could stay at home doing the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.869
 food almost as if such a thing thanks to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.790
 unless I cut the waist unless you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.510
 it bothered a little because the plane 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.940
 I was tense and threw 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.810
 the same thing happened when they played like 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.480
 yesterday that luckily was next to the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.520
 Milk time it was not unusual to see Maria 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.160
 a martita and a juancho looking at the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.070
 television while three hours the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.290
 they pulled a little towards the street because 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.290
 the father had not returned yet 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
 in one way or another those of laso dos de 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.670
 fixing them 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.269
 although of course there were things that could not 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.940
 do for example john I had never 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.709
 gone because he had been able to go out and give 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.709
 back to the apple with its sideburns 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.070
 and that was quite serious because when 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.940
 I had a pair of gleaming skates with 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.850
 yellow wheels 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.569
 but that I could only hold one lap 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.760
 to the apple in two machines 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.609
 the area would have liked to visit 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 to his friend incarnation the barracks 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:05.900
 but what hope had not been invented 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.299
 still a city so resistant that to 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.250
 Maria was a little sorry because it was 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.380
 cute chat with the incarnation of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.010
 so many things 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.140
 and they count well doing what they would not have 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.270
 I would have loved to go to the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.180
 court to sing like crazy a good 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.780
 development but I could not 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.470
 the waves did not give so much 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.150
 and that John not secretly gave 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.450
 a little rage 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.060
 and marita not to be less also had 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.189
 his hands want to walk alone until 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.430
 the old man alone alone not there were the 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.269
 sheets the white lists pushups and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.269
 resistances 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.099
 and so always for years when a room 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.499
 it got old frayed erroneous to 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.760
 the changed in power another new white and 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.730
 brand new 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.519
 Those from Laso have spent more than 15 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.590
 history rolls of the good and would have 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.329
 been many more rolls of not having 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.329
 been by the license scissors 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.550
 well actually the bright scissors 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.970
 had always been there in the in the 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.160
 seamstress sunk between the buttons and 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.730
 posters 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.280
 but never open as much as that afternoon 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.280
 and one of them at once because it was a 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.530
 sunny afternoon like a scissors 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.620
 where the flames are as always 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.340
 you finish maria occasion gray pants and 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.919
 boring barita looked like maria cossío 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.460
 Juan has looked like Maria look 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.340
 yellow yellow that I knew 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.150
 juan look how much will look little wood that 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.150
 I looked yellow 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.030
 each scissors shone both mary 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.460
 and Christ had grabbed the bitch 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.970
 and while he was sewing he watched the solita 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.000
 Enlist in white piles over 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.529
 the floor actually Maria had never 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.319
 thought a lot about the leaves 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.659
 now suddenly the best looks 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.689
 stares and stays and gave 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.629
 mind that he had them radio 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.129
 then it happened finally what I had 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:29.669
 to happen once and for all 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.800
 Maria de la Tijera and tris after not for 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.769
 the whole planet london cut the works 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.219
 just one who had some 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:41.129
 hours later all the third and the 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:44.029
 juan fourth cut them and mannitol and story 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.029
 cut a string 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.960
 winglets cut fell to the floor and 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.360
 they remained quiet poor things of the 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.300
 leaves were not used to live 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.150
 unleashed at the beginning were 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.450
 very much and almost almost run out 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.630
 they buy another roll but later Juan 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.370
 said lower almost I would almost go to the 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.850
 ferro court who went to run 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.060
 Mary said higher almost almost'd go 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:16.880
 to visit the incarnation and the barrack 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.400
 and Juan ran to look for the skates of 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.590
 the yellow wheels and marita discussion 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.590
 and the baldíos with asthma at two 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.260
 journals 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.810
 this time the necks of the grapes went by 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.810
 four afternoons are all different 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.430
 they found again at night if 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.560
 they were tired because it was not easy 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.290
 walk alone and to either side 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.150
 juan and maría that there will be zero very strong and 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.450
 things were told 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.880
 juancho with contour while it comes 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.600
 of the skates that in the neighborhood had a 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 friend who called us juan but bartolo 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.440
 little hand 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.050
 He said that next to being able to walk 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.770
 there were always blue bells and 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.770
 red geraniums 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:08.879
 of yoga they did not talk match so that 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.879
 was going to talk about those such a united people 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.339
 here
