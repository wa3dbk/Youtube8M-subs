00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.250
 welcome good afternoon meets with 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.380
 oca they are up 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.050
 by the way you want some ranges not 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 thank you I appreciate it I am in 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.800
 a strict diet 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 i 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 hear you and the diet 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.300
 I get the impression that they are not 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 taking this matter seriously very well 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 how is the organization going for the song 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.060
 I met a first-year student who 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.739
 he sings divine and he also sees himself playing piano 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.080
 so you can help us 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.210
 song composition tomorrow I'll talk 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.339
 with her without fail if you can compose 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.220
 songs we should start 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 write now the songs are not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.979
 trans dices 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.979
 true 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.010
 very well 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.549
 remember the solid secondaries and see 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.329
 poems of that kind of thing true 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.329
 remember truth 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.070
 I refuse to do it 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 I refuse to just think that this way 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.360
 kind of things make me feel too much 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.520
 shame remember that the stars do not 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.369
 they are ashamed of nothing all camps that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.729
 but that is busy designing the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.690
 changing rooms that I know take care 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.500
 after all your clue what we 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.500
 involved in this 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.640
 I do not think it's a good idea, it's not true 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.340

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.380

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.400
 good 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.150
 it's fair 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.760
 hear 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.400
 however, I will take care of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.209
 training for the concert in the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.209
 ambient 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.380
 his movements seem easy but 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.990
 they do not stop at any time always 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.080
 smile and do not lack breath that 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.780
 it requires a lot 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.080
 Place a position of push-ups 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.080

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.799

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.430
 you want to be able to do some push-ups 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.430
 smiling 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.190
 I am already ready thanks to the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.780

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.959
 training to be able to sing with 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.840
 enthusiasm since I guess it's not 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.990
 easy to be a written time yes so 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.990

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.590
 excellent if we do not get to it 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.590

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.620

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.109

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.940
 spirituals from different places like 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.799
