00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 new day new chronic with 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 hi hi hello 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 so do you tell us about a new 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 book today quite that is a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 new place of 1943 you prefer 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.679
 the great classics deadly poetry 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 timeless 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 quite so from what and the immortal 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.119
 will talk to us today 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.630
 imprudent traveler from rené barjavel a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.650
 French author do not arrive 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 excessively often in his 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.380
 chronic 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.900
 so like that it's done so it's a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.539
 the friqués dates from 1943 and is a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 french sf book of the time which 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.390
 I think is a good combo that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 I admire science fiction 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 I like old science fiction 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 with ugly covers and I like 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.480
 speak French well from time to time 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.700
 for once it is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.309
 especially ugly yes we know we 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 why all green we do not know 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 why he has a mustache because 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 it's an alien in spy next 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.910
 missed his hull is ok then the traveler 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.460
 name is the story of a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 scientist who discovers a product that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 is called our elite 3 and that allows to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 travel back in time and so it goes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 to walk around at the beginning a little bit 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.220
 the snatch eventually he builds a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 kind of costumes which explains 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 probably this ugly thing then of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.460
 scuba to travel wife and so 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 at the beginning he's careful he goes in the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.369
 near future to play lotto and a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.659
 moment he leaps into the future 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 very far to see what second 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.630
 humanity is good it's not terrible in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.579
 does it become every human 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.960
 becomes hyper specialized depending on his place 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.900
 in the society of the blow his body is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 modified according to what makes you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 not too many opportunities for conversion 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 600 early for example that makes the internet 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 all day they're typing on your 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.460
 turned keyboard says ten fingers two because 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.990
 that you already have ten fingers ten fingers to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.670
 every hand probably it's very 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.720
 great game to store information 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.119
 but by cons I would not have too much 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
 legs they have freaked out what 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.740
 would be sexy ways but his playable head 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.229
 with tips our fashion blogger 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.159
 ok I see the idea so travel there 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 in the future etc 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.750
 he realizes that human society 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.209
 will not really be better in his momentum 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.729
 so there is a satire side of society 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.940
 consumption and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.890
 and production etc and above all it goes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 also in the past and the urgent corsican 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.330
 to pass it's complicated payment 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.849
 it's having paradoxes and in fact 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.409
 book will take French and the first 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.459
 book or via the paradox of the grandfather 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:32.209
 which is the idea that if you do not know of 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.099
 spoil do not know exactly where that if you 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.290
 you know how to go back in time 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.819
 and that your grandfather blackcurrant has created 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.379
 a paradox because if you're tall 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.879
 father you never born and suddenly you 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.440
 have never come to kill him but if you are 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.569
 never come to kill him you are and you 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.160
 existes and that's how all 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.420
 wild movies and intends to fight the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.140
 margoulette because it's hyper 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.000
 complicated to manage 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.799
 and so this is the first book we see 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.359
 this and I really like the story of 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.280
 time travel I really like 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.079
 paradox stuff where people go 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.170
 for a fantastic exploration and in 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.549
 do it's anything because 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.720
 it is not necessary to travel in time 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.190
 really I think that if we invent the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.569
 time travel I did not have I 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.849
 saw the filmed scene grabbed him for 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.200
 know it's not a good idea but 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.329
 it was my little one who was talking too much 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 rational min at the atp nature yesterday t'es 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.700
 not a traveler 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.260
 reckless 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.150
 that's totally I'm a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.349
 prudent traveler sedan who stays on 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.650
 my chair with my legs atrophied 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.609
 to make the internet 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.500
 so basically it's a book to advise 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.750
 to all the people who like them 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.139
 trips and in time 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.109
 quite and the considerations a 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:39.169
 little bit of satirical and ironic type 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.040
 on the company and me personally I 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.870
 find it's still very interesting 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.079
 to see how people from before see 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 the future and suddenly my shoelace dacha 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.650
 milan what like book but it gives 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 already an idea of ​​how is that in 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.209
 any case barjavel who has a very nice name 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.489
 for once you see you see the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.379
 society and the future of humanity and that 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.540
 it's always interesting but at the same 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.190
 time is not here hainaut goes back 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.319
 at a lot of adventure a lot of 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.629
 since there are several trips all we 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.030
 make it very good but we have the 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.699
 under text which is also quite 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.819
 stupid is what goes into the year 2000 and 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:15.410
 does not know if he goes in land to see 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.639
 all computers in the African world 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.379
 functional stolen car 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.669
 when matt dallas and all thanks a lot 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.669
