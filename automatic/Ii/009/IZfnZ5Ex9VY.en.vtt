four and then once I get to the top

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.060 
four and then once I get to the top
three<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.990> change<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> colors<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.860> car

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
then I go gold and then I make it a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.820 
then I go gold and then I make it a
little<00:01:24.600> different<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.530> halfway<00:01:25.680> through

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
little different and halfway through

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.679

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
cold and then I go red for the final one

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
cold and then I go red for the final one
yeah<00:01:30.689> well<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.140> there's<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.650> reading

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
