00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.650
TOYA: ONE MAN'S JUNK HAS TURNED

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.490
OUT TO BE A CENTURIES-OLD

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.620
TREASURE FOR A LOCAL HISTORIC

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.620
CHURCH.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.620
AS WISN 12 NEWS'S MIKE ANDERSON

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.460
REPORTS NEW AT 5:00, THE CHURCH

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.560
IS CALLING THE DISCOVERY HEAVEN

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
SENT.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.730
MIKE: PARISHIONERS HAVE

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.670
CELEBRATED MASS AT ST.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.700
STANISLAUS CHURCH FOR 150 YEARS.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.840
THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.610
UNDERGOING MAJOR RENOVATION FOR

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.740
ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN ITS

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740
HISTORY.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.840
RENOVATORS HAVE A PARTICULAR

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.740
GOAL IN MIND.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.780
THEIR THEME -- HONORING THE PAST

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.780
WITH GIVE FOR THE FUTURE.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.720
AND THE WAY THE PAST CONNECTED

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720
TO THE FUTURE ON THIS PROJECT IS

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.790
KIND OF MIRACULOUS.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.790
THE ORIGINAL STAINED GLASS

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.790
WINDOWS, WHICH WERE REMOVED AND

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.860
THOUGHT DESTROYED DURING THE

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.760
LAST RENOVATION BACK IN THE LATE

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.830
1960'S, SURFACED OUT OF NOWHERE

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.900
ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.700
ACTUALLY, THEY'VE BEEN SITTING

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.900
IN A LOCAL GUY'S BASEMENT FOR 50

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
YEARS.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.870
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, WE'LL

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.770
BE ABLE TO RESTORE ALL THE

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.870
WINDOWS BACK TO WHAT THEY WERE

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.870
BACK IN 1872.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.870
MIKE: CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.880
ABBEY GEORGE BAIRD SAYS THE GUY

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.940
CALLED HIM A FEW DAYS AGO AND

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.950
SAID, SOMEBODY GAVE MY MOTHER

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.910
THESE OLD WINDOWS, I'M SELLING

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.920
MY HOUSE AND I GOT TO GET RID OF

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.880
THEM, DO YOU WANT THEM?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.920
IT WAS JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.990
OUT OF THE BLUE.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.990
WE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AND SO

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.520
IT'S VERY PROVIDENTIAL AND, YES,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.030
THE LORD DOES WORK IN GREAT

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.560
WAYS.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.060
MIKE: THEY WERE SITTING IN

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.060
BOXES, IN PIECES LIKE THIS.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.000
THE CHURCH HAD THEM PICKED UP BY

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.900
CONRAD SCHMITT, THE MASTER

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.030
RESTORATION COMPANY IN NEW

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.100
BERLIN.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.070
TO HAVE THIS WHEN WE'RE

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.000
TRYING TO RESTORE THE CHURCH AND

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.110
MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL AGAIN IS

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.140
PRETTY RARE, AND THE

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.180
COINCIDENCES THAT CAME ABOUT

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.150
WITH THE TIMING IS TERRIFIC.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
MIKE: THROUGH MANY FUNDRAISING

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.280
DINNERS, PARISHIONERS HAVE BEEN

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.250
WORKING TO RESTORE ST.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.190
STANISLAUS BACK TO THE GLORY

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.260
THAT IT WAS BACK WHEN THE POLISH

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.690
IMMIGRANTS BUILT IT 1872.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.230
AND HERE, ALL IT TOOK WAS FOR A

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.000
GUY TO CLEAN OUT HIS BASEMENT.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.630
MIKE ANDERSON, WISN 12 NEWS.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.370
TOYA: THE HOPE FOR CHURCH

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.500
LEADERS IS THAT THE RESTORATION

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.320
IS COMPLETE IN TIME TO CELEBRATE
