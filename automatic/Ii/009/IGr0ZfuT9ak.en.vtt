00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so this one's the expo and the great

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
so this one's the expo and the great
thing<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.690> can<00:01:45.720> stuff

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
thing about this is that you can stuff

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.000 
thing about this is that you can stuff
it<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.890> comes<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.630> expands<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
it and then it comes and expands so it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.040 
it and then it comes and expands so it's
kind<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.400> mandible<00:01:50.820> feature<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.870> side

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
kind of a mandible feature on the side

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.390 
kind of a mandible feature on the side
so<00:01:52.350> when<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.590> less<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> carry<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.220> zip

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
so when you have less to carry you zip
