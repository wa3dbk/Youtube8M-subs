00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.070
 Just got back from a session one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 ralf movie booth that is a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 celebration of all the years of game and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 a very pleasant and functional surprise 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 the story of director ralph for those who do not 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.869
 knows the following 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.080
 ralf is a villain in a game of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.059
 video game in fact and he 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.700
 tired of being a villain, he thinks everything is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 wrong in his life and deserves other 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 things because in fact only heroes are 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.960
 that if my glory and the villain is 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 always start the flies so he 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 reveals 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.559
 he quits the game and looks for another 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.500
 pc and hero in other games and basically 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.719
 that's what the movie is based on 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.219
 how the deal do not know if it looks like tron 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 but it's a platform trip 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.520
 platform so be honest with me 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 same 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.430
 It should be very good to be the good guy or is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 a villain but that does not mean that you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 It's bad, I do not want to be a villain anymore. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 I was even pleased to know 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.180
 that I was not stupid 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 with this recipe to say that I'm in the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 best video game movies I've ever 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.259
 I saw today a strong contender to be 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.650
 or is not a transcript but is a series 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.079
 is the mercenaries of video games is an ode 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.520
 on who plays normally exactly if 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.990
 saw the explosion and the shooting of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 mercenaries liked having a movie 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 you play goes after all 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.189
 the high because you will find it has 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 various open-plan scenes with a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.530
 character game you go 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 find lost playboy beyond 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.189
 classic sony that has cover and these 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.610
 you will record the name when you b 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.799
 see what converts the fabrÃ­cio is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 find the way back who was 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 Hot to those who already threw the towel in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.830
 life will remember a detail for 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.660
 Who does not play video games? 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.090
 the film is a bit strange because 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.120
 many of the jokes 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.880
 Let's lose is who has the movie full of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.890
 references references are direct 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.380
 or indirectly has a joke or 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.900
 other the only thing I felt 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.460
 thing got lost in the match 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 gladiator shop is very cool by 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:31.100
 sign rafael cortez is the villain 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.040
 James the Abravanel is the ralf and the moon mari 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.190
 is the supporting actor who, by the way, has 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.740
 very well the service a medal 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.600
 I won on the hero's mission I said 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.680
 do not travel 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.320
 I liked the father who got into bed more 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 I think you played the game. 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.070
 I also wanted to take my daughter 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.570
 will understand nothing yet but she will 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.250
 to enjoy when she plays together 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.209
 With me, this reference is very cool. 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.380
 so even those that are not direct 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.270
 street fighter when it appears 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.000
 sensational 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.420
 It's worth you guys to discover a hobby. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.310
 of the river post time of the game is also that 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.530
 nobody knew exactly one thing that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.870
 It surprises us that way. 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.510
 of time already the base of the faces of 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 research was insistence the student has 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.550
 a lot and made a lot of people have 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.040
 obvious references to those who are younger 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.930
 and there is a lot of obscure reference that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000
 are you guys actually the disk is 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.220
 business if the time really 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.980
 dodo in the afternoon and even today 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.510
 I feel really cool and something that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.850
 caught my attention is the kind of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.640
 movie that is watched with smile in the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.830
 Dude , I stayed the whole time. 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.410
 watching like a movie fool 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.420
 because it's really fun to stay with 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.580
 this intention in the details that the guys 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.739
 for example your choice only 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.600
 boyfriend - boyfriend thinks you're an idiot 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.370
 what you like video game does not take 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.140
 it to watch but only in the distribution 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.780

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.030

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.799

 Brazil, January 4 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.260
 I think it's an excellent opportunity. 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.150
 to have fun on vacation there the movie is 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.010
 Well cool, I would say this one here. 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.139

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.629
