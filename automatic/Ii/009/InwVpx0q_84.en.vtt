and you want to fill it to the top then

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.240 
and you want to fill it to the top then
put<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.700> top<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.450> upside<00:02:16.050> down<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.320> like

motion<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.300> makes<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.600> vacuum

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
motion because that makes a vacuum

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
motion because that makes a vacuum
thingy<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.710> that's<00:02:22.950> like<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:23.880> designed

this I don't actually know if he even
uses<00:04:35.729> this<00:04:36.979> because<00:04:37.979> he<00:04:38.159> has<00:04:38.250> like<00:04:39.139> two<00:04:40.139> things

bedding gets in it which it sticks for

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.510 
bedding gets in it which it sticks for
so<00:04:49.409> that's<00:04:50.099> more<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.580> failed<00:04:50.909> attempt<00:04:52.069> um

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.529 

it's<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.639> nice<00:04:57.030> because<00:04:58.069> the<00:04:59.069> tubes<00:04:59.539> come

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
it's really nice because the tubes come

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.420 
it's really nice because the tubes come
with<00:05:00.750> this<00:05:01.460> interlocking<00:05:02.479> ring<00:05:04.190> system<00:05:05.190> that

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
with this interlocking ring system that

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.350 
with this interlocking ring system that
like<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:05.819> twist<00:05:06.449> and<00:05:07.199> it<00:05:07.770> locks<00:05:08.039> but<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.210> you

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
like you twist and it locks but if you

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.920 
like you twist and it locks but if you
can<00:05:09.569> see<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:11.430> like<00:05:11.699> thicker<00:05:12.210> here<00:05:12.719> and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
can see it's like thicker here and

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.980 
can see it's like thicker here and
there's<00:05:13.919> also<00:05:14.069> a<00:05:14.250> thicker<00:05:14.580> white<00:05:14.969> part<00:05:15.270> on<00:05:15.539> the

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
there's also a thicker white part on the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.140 
there's also a thicker white part on the
inside<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.650> it's<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.490> colored<00:05:17.789> part<00:05:17.940> that

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
inside and it's the colored part that

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.439 
inside and it's the colored part that
moves<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:19.250> you<00:05:20.250> want<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.639> thicker<00:05:20.940> part<00:05:21.060> of

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
moves and you want the thicker part of

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.640 
moves and you want the thicker part of
the<00:05:21.599> colored<00:05:21.870> part<00:05:22.020> should<00:05:22.199> be<00:05:22.229> on<00:05:22.379> thicker

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
the colored part should be on thicker

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.040 
the colored part should be on thicker
part<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.129> white<00:05:23.310> part<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.180> then

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
part of the white part and that then

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.209 
part of the white part and that then
that's<00:05:25.319> when<00:05:25.560> flocks<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.780> windows<00:05:28.219> actually

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
that's when flocks the windows actually

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.670 
that's when flocks the windows actually
sometimes<00:05:29.729> really<00:05:30.120> hard<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.509> get<00:05:30.630> off<00:05:30.810> but

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
sometimes really hard to get off but

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
actually a pretty small box which is

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.680 
actually a pretty small box which is
really<00:05:58.469> surprising<00:05:58.949> because<00:05:59.849> of<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.150> size<00:06:00.479> of

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
really surprising because of the size of

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:09.950 
really surprising because of the size of
it<00:06:00.840> because<00:06:01.800> this

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:20.010 

this<00:06:15.780> this<00:06:16.780> is<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.560> box<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.090> this<00:06:19.090> comes<00:06:19.780> in

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
this this is the box that this comes in

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.460 
this this is the box that this comes in
so<00:06:20.979> yeah<00:06:21.250> it's<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:22.150> bit<00:06:22.419> of<00:06:22.539> a<00:06:22.629> size<00:06:22.960> difference

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
so yeah it's a bit of a size difference

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.559 
so yeah it's a bit of a size difference
and<00:06:23.650> for<00:06:24.190> those<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.580> have<00:06:24.789> who<00:06:25.150> have<00:06:25.180> seen
