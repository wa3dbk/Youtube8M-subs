dependent on how i'm feeling at the time
so<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.510> I've<00:00:57.600> made<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:59.030> for

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so what I've made here is actually for

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.119 
so what I've made here is actually for
this<00:01:00.149> first<00:01:00.390> video<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.649> too<00:01:01.980> much

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this first video um it's not too much

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.719 
this first video um it's not too much
yet<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> first<00:01:04.680> video<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.220> um

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
yet it's just the first video but um

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.660 
yet it's just the first video but um
what<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.960> took<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.470> old<00:01:08.540> creation<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
what I did is I took the old creation of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
what I did is I took the old creation of
of<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.479> hidden<00:01:12.990> hallway<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
of a hidden hallway kind of like this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
of a hidden hallway kind of like this
this<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> shown<00:01:16.140> as

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
this would I just have this shown as

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
this would I just have this shown as
gold<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> doorway<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
gold so you can see with the doorway is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
gold so you can see with the doorway is
normally<00:01:18.450> you'd<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> flush<00:01:19.080> wall<00:01:19.380> but

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
normally you'd make it a flush wall but

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
normally you'd make it a flush wall but
what<00:01:20.040> I've<00:01:20.159> done<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.670> normally<00:01:21.090> you'll<00:01:21.210> see

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
what I've done is normally you'll see

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
what I've done is normally you'll see
pistons<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> side<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> wall<00:01:22.560> I've

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
pistons on the side of the wall I've

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.950 
pistons on the side of the wall I've
improved<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.549> I've<00:01:24.060> made<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.659> there's<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
improved it I've made it so there's a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.039 
improved it I've made it so there's a
nice<00:01:25.290> flush<00:01:25.650> wall<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.299> how's<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
nice flush wall on so here how's it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.149 
nice flush wall on so here how's it
works<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.259> you'll<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.530> obviously<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
works like that you'll see obviously you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.390 
works like that you'll see obviously you
make<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> same<00:01:32.970> color<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:34.220> these<00:01:35.220> are

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
make these the same color but these are

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
make these the same color but these are
just<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> show<00:01:35.820> where<00:01:36.060> redstone<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.990> where

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
just to show where redstone is and where

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.240 
just to show where redstone is and where
movable<00:01:37.680> blocks<00:01:38.189> are<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.920> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
movable blocks are so it's it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
movable blocks are so it's it's
basically<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> same<00:01:42.090> thing<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.780> an<00:01:42.930> improved

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
basically the same thing but an improved

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
basically the same thing but an improved
version<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> no<00:01:44.670> longer<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:45.149> those

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
version so you no longer get those

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.230 
version so you no longer get those
pistons<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> way<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> red

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
pistons in the way and here is the red

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.160 
pistons in the way and here is the red
stone<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.060> took<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.689> took<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.020> little

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
stone for it it it took it took a little

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.649 
stone for it it it took it took a little
while<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.880> problem<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
while just because the problem with this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.350 
while just because the problem with this
is<00:01:55.070> there's<00:01:56.070> bud<00:01:56.369> switches<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
is there's bud switches that you have to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200 
is there's bud switches that you have to
be<00:01:57.450> careful<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:58.219> because<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> diagonal

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
be careful of because of the diagonal

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
be careful of because of the diagonal
way<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> powering<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.799> stuff<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.369> end<00:02:02.729> up

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
way of powering and stuff and I end up

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
way of powering and stuff and I end up
having<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> use<00:02:03.240> torches<00:02:03.570> over<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
having to use torches over here and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.789 
having to use torches over here and
stuff<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.820> how<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.799> pistons

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
stuff just because of how it pistons

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.040 
stuff just because of how it pistons
work<00:02:08.090> but<00:02:09.090> I've<00:02:09.209> ensure<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> work

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
work but I've ensure you got it to work

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.490 
work but I've ensure you got it to work
on<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> time<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.290> this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
on so this is this is a time like this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
on so this is this is a time like this
is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.309 
is
not<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.280> most<00:02:14.490> compact<00:02:14.910> way<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.840> most

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
not the most compact way that the most

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.740 
not the most compact way that the most
compact<00:02:16.650> way<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.250> dependent<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:17.940> your

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
compact way kind is dependent on your

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470 
compact way kind is dependent on your
wants<00:02:19.440> like<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.670> want<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.300> more

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
wants like if you want if you have more

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.540 
wants like if you want if you have more
space<00:02:21.690> upwards<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.680> make<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.069> kind<00:02:23.400> of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
space upwards you can make this kind of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
space upwards you can make this kind of
squish<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.000> sideways<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.599> make<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> higher

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
squish it in sideways and make it higher

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.860 
squish it in sideways and make it higher
or<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:25.920> more<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.690> just

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
or if you have more with you can just

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870 
or if you have more with you can just
flatten<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.459> stuff<00:02:29.790> like

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
flatten it out of it like stuff like

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.699 
flatten it out of it like stuff like
this<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.480> put<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.989> bit<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
this you can put down a bit and make it

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.090 
this you can put down a bit and make it
out<00:02:31.890> more<00:02:32.989> but<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.380> kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.590> went<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:34.920> an

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
out more but I just kind of went on an

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.630 
out more but I just kind of went on an
in-between<00:02:35.700> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.770> way<00:02:37.770> with<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.160> kind<00:02:38.580> of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
in-between kind of way with it kind of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990 
in-between kind of way with it kind of
in<00:02:39.000> between<00:02:39.150> yeah<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.220> will<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.580> making<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
in between yeah so I will be making it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.309 
in between yeah so I will be making it
tutorial<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.319> that

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
tutorial on this but for right now that

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.690 
tutorial on this but for right now that
I'll<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.739> going<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.010> through<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> basics

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
I'll just going to go through the basics

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.720 
I'll just going to go through the basics
of<00:02:47.850> what<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.680> what<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.280> you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
of what it is what I have here is you

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
of what it is what I have here is you
can<00:02:50.970> really<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.510> anywhere<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.350> button

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
can really put this anywhere this button

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.150 
can really put this anywhere this button
just<00:02:53.819> link<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.920> I'm

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
just link it up to this I think it's I'm

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.559 
just link it up to this I think it's I'm
pretty<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> monostable<00:02:57.030> circuit

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
pretty sure it's a monostable circuit

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.600 
pretty sure it's a monostable circuit
what<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> does<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> takes<00:02:58.799> any<00:02:59.069> pulse<00:02:59.340> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
what it does is it takes any pulse and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.840 
what it does is it takes any pulse and
creates<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> one<00:03:00.390> tick<00:03:00.870> pulse<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.700> what

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
creates it to a one tick pulse so what

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.880 
creates it to a one tick pulse so what
that<00:03:02.880> does<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.690> goes<00:03:04.080> over<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.799> this

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that does is that goes over here to this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.289 
that does is that goes over here to this
redstone<00:03:05.280> repeater<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.120> mighty

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
redstone repeater and this is mighty

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.870 
redstone repeater and this is mighty
flip-flop<00:03:06.989> for<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.319> thing<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> compact

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
flip-flop for the thing it is a compact

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.530 
flip-flop for the thing it is a compact
t<00:03:09.120> flip-flop<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.750> goes<00:03:10.019> based<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:12.330> in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
t flip-flop it goes based on the the in

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.720 
t flip-flop it goes based on the the in
the<00:03:12.690> game<00:03:12.900> where<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.620> piston<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.220> powered

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the game where if a piston is powered

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.509 
the game where if a piston is powered
for<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.239> tick<00:03:15.510> it'll<00:03:16.170> extend<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.830> retract<00:03:16.950> so

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
for one tick it'll extend and retract so

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.920 
for one tick it'll extend and retract so
quickly<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.850> will<00:03:18.120> leave<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.480> block<00:03:18.720> behind

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
quickly that will leave the block behind

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.140 
quickly that will leave the block behind
so<00:03:19.590> that's<00:03:19.980> basically<00:03:20.130> how<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.549> creates<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:21.000> tea

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
so that's basically how it creates a tea

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.430 
so that's basically how it creates a tea
flip-flop<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.320> very<00:03:22.470> compact<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.100> nice<00:03:23.250> way

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
flip-flop in a very compact and nice way

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.890 
flip-flop in a very compact and nice way
so<00:03:25.440> what<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.680> does<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:27.299> other<00:03:27.480> way<00:03:27.840> for

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
so what it does is the other way for

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
so what it does is the other way for
this<00:03:28.140> redstone<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.769> is<00:03:28.950> oh<00:03:29.070> by<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.250> way

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
this redstone to go is oh by the way

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.460 
this redstone to go is oh by the way
this<00:03:29.640> redstone<00:03:30.000> pires<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.480> toward<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.170> i'm

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
this redstone pires that toward that i'm

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.349 
this redstone pires that toward that i'm
not<00:03:31.500> torch<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.400> repeater<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:33.209> you're

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
not torch that repeater if you're

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.270 
not torch that repeater if you're
wondering<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.320> happens<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.799> power

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
wondering so what happens is that power

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.819 
wondering so what happens is that power
that<00:03:35.670> power<00:03:36.180> comes<00:03:36.450> over<00:03:36.660> here<00:03:36.930> along<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
that power comes over here along the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.789 
that power comes over here along the
bottom<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.310> then<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.290> can<00:03:40.410> see<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.680> kind

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
bottom and then as you can see it kind

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.740 
bottom and then as you can see it kind
of<00:03:40.890> goes<00:03:41.010> under<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.700> comes<00:03:42.329> over<00:03:42.540> here

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
of goes under there and comes over here

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.199 
of goes under there and comes over here
to<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.370> double<00:03:44.730> piston<00:03:45.030> extender

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
to this this is a double piston extender

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.690 
to this this is a double piston extender
if<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.930> good<00:03:46.230> look<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.400> these

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
if I can get a good look at it so these

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.699 
if I can get a good look at it so these
were<00:03:47.940> what<00:03:48.359> we're<00:03:48.510> pushing<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.140> gold<00:03:49.440> blocks

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
were what we're pushing the gold blocks

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
were what we're pushing the gold blocks
at<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.980> start<00:03:50.190> there<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> close<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.030> door<00:03:51.720> or

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
at the start there to close the door or

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.080 
at the start there to close the door or
the<00:03:52.380> hallway<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:52.980> then<00:03:53.280> these<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.060> a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the hallway and then these this is a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.990 
the hallway and then these this is a
double<00:03:54.269> piston<00:03:54.540> extender<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.890> what<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.819> does

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
double piston extender so what it does

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.870 
double piston extender so what it does
is<00:03:57.350> basically<00:03:58.350> double<00:03:58.920> extends<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.519> now

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
is basically double extends and now

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.210 
is basically double extends and now
retracts<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.510> back<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.170> what<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:01.950> have

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
retracts it back and then what I have

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.539 
retracts it back and then what I have
here<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:03.420> piston<00:04:03.840> right<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.500> grabs<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
here is the piston right here grabs the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.840 
here is the piston right here grabs the
block<00:04:05.760> from<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.569> doorway<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.769> then<00:04:08.459> this<00:04:08.790> one

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
block from the doorway and then this one

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.569 
block from the doorway and then this one
places<00:04:09.660> down<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.049> side<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.500> wall<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:11.519> you

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
places down the side of the wall as you

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.210 
places down the side of the wall as you
can<00:04:12.090> see<00:04:12.299> right<00:04:12.680> here<00:04:13.680> through<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.010> gold

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
can see right here through the gold

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.430 
can see right here through the gold
blocks<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.600> where<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> piston<00:04:16.109> pulls<00:04:16.320> it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
blocks this is where the piston pulls it

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.810 
blocks this is where the piston pulls it
up<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.950> make<00:04:17.039> go<00:04:17.190> way<00:04:17.370> through<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
up so you can make go way through and

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.159 
up so you can make go way through and
this<00:04:18.329> would<00:04:18.570> pull<00:04:18.870> push<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.410> down<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:19.979> a

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
this would pull push it down so it's a

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.450 
this would pull push it down so it's a
so<00:04:22.169> makes<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.470> flush<00:04:22.650> wall<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:22.979> obviously<00:04:23.340> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
so makes a flush wall and obviously you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.730 
so makes a flush wall and obviously you
put<00:04:23.640> this<00:04:23.789> as<00:04:23.940> iron<00:04:24.210> or<00:04:24.479> blocked<00:04:25.289> or<00:04:25.500> whatever

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
put this as iron or blocked or whatever

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.350 
put this as iron or blocked or whatever
your<00:04:25.950> hallway<00:04:26.159> is<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.700> looks<00:04:26.909> flush<00:04:27.180> with

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
your hallway is so it looks flush with

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.860 
your hallway is so it looks flush with
the<00:04:27.390> wall

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
the wall

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.439 
the wall
then<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:28.710> press<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.010> button<00:04:29.130> again

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
then you just press the button again

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.879 
then you just press the button again
there<00:04:30.449> you<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:31.320> have<00:04:31.350> your<00:04:31.590> hidden

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
there you go you have your hidden

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.700 
there you go you have your hidden
doorway<00:04:32.310> with<00:04:32.880> no<00:04:33.240> annoying<00:04:33.660> pistons<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
doorway with no annoying pistons on the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.100 
doorway with no annoying pistons on the
side<00:04:36.949> so<00:04:37.949> that<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> basics<00:04:39.449> of<00:04:39.570> this<00:04:39.720> as<00:04:39.900> i

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
side so that is the basics of this as i

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.320 
side so that is the basics of this as i
have<00:04:40.350> said<00:04:40.590> i<00:04:40.770> will<00:04:41.220> make<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> tutorial<00:04:41.850> honest

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
have said i will make a tutorial honest

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.439 
have said i will make a tutorial honest
making<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.229> much<00:04:43.380> more<00:04:43.620> in-depth<00:04:44.100> how<00:04:44.610> this<00:04:45.270> is

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
making a much more in-depth how this is

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.680 
making a much more in-depth how this is
how<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.080> all<00:04:46.229> made<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.160> all<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.940> tix<00:04:48.449> and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
how this is all made and all the tix and

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.230 
how this is all made and all the tix and
all<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.900> timings<00:04:49.440> with<00:04:49.620> all<00:04:49.770> these<00:04:49.919> because

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
all the timings with all these because

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.240 
all the timings with all these because
this<00:04:51.240> was<00:04:51.600> made<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.199> with<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.710> very<00:04:53.010> specific

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
this was made and with a very specific

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.620 
this was made and with a very specific
tiny<00:04:53.820> like<00:04:54.060> say<00:04:54.270> if<00:04:54.750> i<00:04:54.930> was<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.110> set<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.650> this

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
tiny like say if i was to set this this

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.520 
tiny like say if i was to set this this
repeater<00:04:57.630> right<00:04:57.840> here<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.199> something<00:04:58.470> like

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
repeater right here to something like

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.010 
repeater right here to something like
three<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.010> not<00:04:59.130> for<00:04:59.780> definitely<00:05:00.780> would<00:05:00.900> not

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
three and not for definitely would not

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.170 
three and not for definitely would not
work<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.919> all<00:05:02.100> very<00:05:02.130> dependent<00:05:03.090> on

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
work this is all very dependent on

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.189 
work this is all very dependent on
timing<00:05:04.729> but<00:05:05.729> i<00:05:05.760> do<00:05:05.880> hope<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.389> guys<00:05:06.600> did<00:05:07.020> enjoy
