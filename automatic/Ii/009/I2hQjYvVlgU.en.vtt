00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.789 
videos in this four step I will teach
you<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.250> first<00:00:05.670> step<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.480> last<00:00:06.779> layer<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
you the first step of the last layer the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.820 
you the first step of the last layer the
last<00:00:08.069> layer<00:00:08.280> only<00:00:08.519> has<00:00:08.820> four<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:10.019> easy<00:00:10.320> steps

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
last layer only has four very easy steps

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.209 
last layer only has four very easy steps
therefore<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.670> video<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.240> quite<00:00:12.420> short<00:00:12.809> in

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
therefore this video is quite short in

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.980 
therefore this video is quite short in

the previous videos you learned how to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.950 
the previous videos you learned how to
solve<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.859> two<00:00:17.340> layers<00:00:17.880> as<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.720> here

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
solve first two layers as you see here

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710 
solve first two layers as you see here
on<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> left<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.760> this<00:00:20.760> video<00:00:21.060> I'll<00:00:21.240> teach<00:00:21.539> you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
how to make a plus on the last layer to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.290 
how to make a plus on the last layer to
get<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.539> plus<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.619> edges<00:00:29.130> should<00:00:30.060> face

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
get this plus all the edges should face

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.680 
get this plus all the edges should face
upwards<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.969> cube<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.239> already

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
upwards you see on this cube we already

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.709 
upwards you see on this cube we already
have<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:34.649> edges<00:00:35.280> facing<00:00:35.670> upwards<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.540> get

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have two edges facing upwards you get

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.000 
have two edges facing upwards you get
this<00:00:36.840> most<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> time<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:40.200> other<00:00:40.469> edges<00:00:40.860> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this most of the time to other edges are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.779 
this most of the time to other edges are
still<00:00:41.280> wrong<00:00:42.649> always<00:00:43.649> hold<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> cube<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
still wrong always hold the cube so that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
still wrong always hold the cube so that
you<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.570> correct<00:00:46.200> sticker<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.039> left

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you have a correct sticker on the left

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
side and a wrong sticker on the front

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
side and a wrong sticker on the front
side<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.260> following<00:00:53.809> start

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
side then you can do following start

side then you can do following start
with<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.710> quarter<00:00:56.460> turn<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> front<00:00:57.600> side

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
with a quarter turn on the front side

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.700

clockwise<00:01:00.800> do<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> sexy<00:01:02.280> move<00:01:06.350> enter<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.439> front

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
clockwise do a sexy move enter in front

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.899 
clockwise do a sexy move enter in front
side<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.400> again<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> pattern<00:01:11.670> has

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
side back again you see the pattern has

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.200 
side back again you see the pattern has
changed<00:01:13.549> still<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> plus<00:01:16.200> yet

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
changed still we do not have a plus yet

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
changed still we do not have a plus yet
therefore<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.110> doing<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.680> trick

once do a sexy move turn the front layer

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.430 
once do a sexy move turn the front layer
back<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:30.140> pattern<00:02:30.440> has<00:02:30.590> changed<00:02:30.620> again<00:02:32.440> on
