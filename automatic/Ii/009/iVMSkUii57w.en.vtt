00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Of course my name is dante alves soy 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.340
 publisher and editorial advisor and these 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 talks that we started now is about 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 of the writer's office about 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969
 work every day 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 producing content texts and so on 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.619
 when it usually happens to us when many 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.779
 times a writer faces both the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.449
 PC screen or paper is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 they find that nothing comes to the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 head and they have to write has to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 do something let's say for example the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 title of this video how to write 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.980
 stories ideas 1 because because we are going to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.899
 work precisely that problem to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.149
 starting from how or how you write a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.399
 story from some idea starting 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.190
 at some point with what we can 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.129
 to work 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.250
 I suggest to all of us that we start 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.390
 work with the idea or with the integral or 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.659
 image concept 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.780
 this is an image that we liked that we 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.909
 attracted can be imagined can be 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.549
 derived from a reality and that the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.339
 we modify an idea for our taste 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:07.119
 definitely an image that we find 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.119
 attractive both to work at 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.560
 from it as well as to get there 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.840
 further I want to say because there where 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.800
 you work with the image a way to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.800
 work with the image is 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 as a starting point this 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.520
 we imagine 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.409
 the complete picture in all its detail 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.409
 we are even going to make a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.710
 we can expand on what is the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 psyche of the protagonists of this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 picture doing it is very report the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.410
 image thing we have something good 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.659
 complete well finished by saying it of 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.580
 so that after we put it we put it 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.580
 and they only start walking 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.100
 image characters themselves and give us a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.930
 history that's one way the other 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 way that is what I like to me is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.840
 work with the image but as a point 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.880
 of arrival this means good we 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.619
 we imagine something and how do we do 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.550
 get to that how we got to that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.200
 situation then are the two ways and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.770
 I think it's more interesting to me 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.020
 the last in fact in www point of view 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.080
 com books dot com.ar that page 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 web of the company where I work 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.380
 you can find 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.400
 in a direct link to a story that is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.560
 structured or written from a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.170
 image in this case is a story of mine in 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.630
 the one that the image was originally in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.970
 that my dog ton wanted to take my 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.610
 beer something terrible indeed the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.950
 own dog object of my affection is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.709
 want to take good business is something 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 interesting is a contradiction is a 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.190
 very rich image and a lot of people can 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.280
 Like then I invite you not to be 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.890
 Also seen for www to enter www 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 point of view monero dot com.ar for 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 that they see the possibilities that there 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.489
 describe with an image with either a 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.170
 starting point or a point of arrival 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.739
 this is the case that appears in our 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.959
 web page 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.959
 Greetings then and until next time
