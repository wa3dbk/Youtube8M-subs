00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
Yamaha v-star 1100 classic when I got
the<00:00:20.369> bike<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.270> guy<00:00:21.420> told<00:00:21.720> me<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:22.080> been

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the bike the guy told me had been

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.410 
the bike the guy told me had been
sitting<00:00:22.619> up<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.670> years<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.330> he

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sitting up for about two years that he

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.109 
sitting up for about two years that he
had<00:00:24.630> sold<00:00:25.279> solder<00:00:27.650> surgeries<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:30.000> he

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
had sold solder surgeries and that he

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
had sold solder surgeries and that he
could<00:00:30.300> no<00:00:30.420> longer<00:00:30.449> ride<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> bike<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.710> that's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
could no longer ride the bike and that's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.200 
could no longer ride the bike and that's
why<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:33.000> two<00:00:33.149> years<00:00:34.940> told<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
why it's that for two years told me that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
why it's that for two years told me that
he<00:00:36.360> had<00:00:36.510> recently<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:39.590> drove<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.370> down

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
he had recently and drove it up and down

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.389 
he had recently and drove it up and down
rode<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> whatever<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.590> river<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.190> stuff

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
rode it whatever the river and stuff

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
rode it whatever the river and stuff
like<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.180> parked<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> bike<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like that and parked the bike the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
like that and parked the bike the
battery<00:00:46.649> died<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.539> been

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
battery died and because it's been

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.319 
battery died and because it's been
sitting<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.320> long<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.329> probably

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sitting for so long that I probably

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
sitting for so long that I probably
needed<00:00:51.750> carburetors<00:00:52.350> cleaned<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.219> gas

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
needed carburetors cleaned up that gas

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.529 
needed carburetors cleaned up that gas
probably<00:00:54.420> wasn't<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.870> good<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.270> tried<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
probably wasn't that good so we tried to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
probably wasn't that good so we tried to
start<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> bike<00:00:58.289> wanted<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> hear<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
start the bike wanted to hear it you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
start the bike wanted to hear it you
know<00:00:59.579> turn<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
know turn over and all the only thing it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
know turn over and all the only thing it
did<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> winded<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.559> didn't

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
did is the start of winded you didn't

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
did is the start of winded you didn't
hear<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.309> compression<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> motor<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
hear no compression in the motor the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.399 
hear no compression in the motor the
motor<00:01:06.540> wasn't<00:01:07.080> turning<00:01:07.290> over<00:01:09.140> because<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> had

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
motor wasn't turning over because it had

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
motor wasn't turning over because it had
six<00:01:10.619> thousand<00:01:11.070> miles<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.409> believed<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
six thousand miles and I believed this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
six thousand miles and I believed this
story<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.310> bought<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> bike<00:01:15.509> anyways<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
story I bought the bike anyways and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.660 
story I bought the bike anyways and
loaded<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.369> home<00:01:18.979> I<00:01:20.060> put<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
loaded it up right at home I put a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.830 
loaded it up right at home I put a
booster<00:01:23.670> pack<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:25.939> trickle<00:01:26.939> charger<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
booster pack on the trickle charger and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
booster pack on the trickle charger and
stuff<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:30.740> I'm<00:01:31.740> trying<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> think

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stuff like that and I'm trying to think

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
stuff like that and I'm trying to think
of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> name<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> QuickStart

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
of the name of it like a QuickStart

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.020 
of the name of it like a QuickStart
charger<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:36.390> white<00:01:36.659> didn't<00:01:36.960> turn<00:01:37.140> over

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
charger and the white didn't turn over

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
charger and the white didn't turn over
so<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> point<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.350> pulled<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so then at that point I pulled the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.969 
so then at that point I pulled the
starter<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.259> thought<00:01:43.259> maybe<00:01:43.530> did<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
starter off and thought maybe did the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
starter off and thought maybe did the
Bendix<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> automotive<00:01:45.149> starter<00:01:45.750> wasn't

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Bendix like a automotive starter wasn't

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.550 
Bendix like a automotive starter wasn't
shooting<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.640> winding

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
shooting out that it was just winding

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
shooting out that it was just winding
when<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.890> hold<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> starter<00:01:50.759> Artur

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
when I just hold the starter Artur

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
when I just hold the starter Artur
discovered<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> starter<00:01:52.500> doesn't<00:01:52.649> have

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
discovered that the starter doesn't have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.569 
discovered that the starter doesn't have
a<00:01:53.130> Bendix<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.820> shoots<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.860> has<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> gear

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
a Bendix that shoots out it has a gear

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.209 
a Bendix that shoots out it has a gear
on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> end<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:58.290> gear<00:02:00.710> goes<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.950> another

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
on the end and that gear goes to another

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.370 
on the end and that gear goes to another
gear<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.350> starter<00:02:04.350> clutch<00:02:05.930> that<00:02:06.930> goes<00:02:07.170> out

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
gear that starter clutch that goes out

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
gear that starter clutch that goes out
on<00:02:07.560> these<00:02:07.740> bikes<00:02:08.039> watch<00:02:08.970> some<00:02:09.209> videos<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
on these bikes watch some videos on it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.350 
on these bikes watch some videos on it
did<00:02:10.140> some<00:02:10.349> research<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> kind<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.090> soom

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
did some research and kind of soom

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.700 
did some research and kind of soom
that's<00:02:12.660> what's<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.319> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that's what's going on with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's what's going on with
like<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> starter<00:02:14.550> clutch<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:15.540> no<00:02:15.810> good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
like that the starter clutch is no good

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.160 
like that the starter clutch is no good
and<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.760> rebuild<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.020> buy

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to do that job and to tear it down to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.000 
to do that job and to tear it down to
even<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.450> need<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.010> now

even look to see if I need that now

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
even look to see if I need that now
where<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.520> starter<00:02:29.940> comes<00:02:30.210> out<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.930> see

where the starter comes out you can see

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
where the starter comes out you can see
on<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.710> backside<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.550> starter<00:02:32.940> clutch

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
on the backside of the starter clutch

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.960 
on the backside of the starter clutch
all<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> teeth<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.890> good<00:02:35.100> there's<00:02:35.520> nowhere

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
all the teeth are good there's nowhere

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.420 
all the teeth are good there's nowhere
at<00:02:36.210> all<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:37.320> that's<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.950> side<00:02:38.160> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
at all but that's not the side that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.180 
at all but that's not the side that
wears<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.450> other<00:02:39.780> side<00:02:40.170> underneath<00:02:40.920> the

wears out the other side underneath the
stator<00:02:42.150> cover<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.560> wears<00:02:44.040> out<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
stator cover is what wears out it's the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.360 
stator cover is what wears out it's the
side<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:46.350> throws<00:02:47.450> there's<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.600> gear<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.380> on

twist<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> spool<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.780> when<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.110> starter

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
twist on the spool so when the starter

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
twist on the spool so when the starter
spins<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.300> first<00:02:57.600> gear<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.560> spins<00:02:59.070> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
spool the twist in it throws out it
