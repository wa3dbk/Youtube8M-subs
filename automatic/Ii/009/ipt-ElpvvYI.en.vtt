just<00:02:01.799> amazing<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.430> example<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.540> let's<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
just amazing for example for let's see I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
just amazing for example for let's see I
took<00:02:04.229> some<00:02:04.560> notes<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:04.969> for<00:02:07.009> here<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.220> for

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
took some notes here for here it is for

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.250 
took some notes here for here it is for
oh<00:02:09.410> I'd<00:02:10.410> say<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:11.750> sixty<00:02:12.750> eight<00:02:12.870> hundred

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
oh I'd say about sixty eight hundred

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.050 
oh I'd say about sixty eight hundred
dollars<00:02:13.290> per

so<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:31.099> speaking<00:02:31.580> over<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> lot<00:02:32.090> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
so I know I'm speaking over a lot of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.880 
so I know I'm speaking over a lot of
people's<00:02:32.450> heads<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:32.989> who<00:02:33.620> are<00:02:33.709> lay<00:02:33.860> people

people's heads here who are lay people

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.540 
people's heads here who are lay people
but<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.870> value<00:02:36.319> at<00:02:36.530> brain<00:02:36.769> master<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.340> just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
but the value at brain master is just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.339 
but the value at brain master is just
amazing<00:02:37.819> what<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.330> get<00:02:38.510> for<00:02:38.720> example<00:02:39.110> my

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
amazing what you get for example my

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
setup costs let's see i look at my paper

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.699 
setup costs let's see i look at my paper
thirty-five<00:02:43.760> hundred<00:02:44.030> dollars<00:02:44.540> i<00:02:44.900> spent

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
thirty-five hundred dollars i spent

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.789 
thirty-five hundred dollars i spent
seventeen<00:02:46.519> hundred<00:02:46.819> dollars<00:02:47.150> for<00:02:47.799> the

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
seventeen hundred dollars for the

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.949 
seventeen hundred dollars for the
atlantis<00:02:49.430> itself<00:02:49.970> which<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.600> called<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
atlantis itself which is called the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.500 
atlantis itself which is called the
neurofeedback<00:02:51.440> machine<00:02:51.950> itself<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.700> then

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
neurofeedback machine itself and then

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.809 
neurofeedback machine itself and then
all<00:02:54.290> i<00:02:54.350> needed<00:02:54.709> was<00:02:54.860> about<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> thousand

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
all i needed was about a thousand

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.370 
all i needed was about a thousand
dollars<00:02:56.060> worth<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.360> software<00:02:56.600> which<00:02:57.140> was

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
dollars worth of software which was

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.339 
dollars worth of software which was
actually<00:02:57.590> 900<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:59.330> i<00:02:59.360> could<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.810> stopped<00:03:00.110> at

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
actually 900 so i could have stopped at

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.870 
actually 900 so i could have stopped at
2,600<00:03:01.569> but<00:03:02.569> they<00:03:02.959> sell<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.410> amazing<00:03:04.280> z-score

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
2,600 but they sell this amazing z-score

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.720 
2,600 but they sell this amazing z-score
software<00:03:05.540> which<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.680> decided<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.310> point<00:03:07.549> down

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
software which I decided to point down

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.240 
software which I decided to point down
another<00:03:08.030> 900<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:08.840> an<00:03:08.959> amazing<00:03:09.620> breakthrough

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
another 900 it's an amazing breakthrough

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.699 
another 900 it's an amazing breakthrough
technology<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.660> z-score<00:03:12.170> software

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
technology to have the z-score software

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.400 
technology to have the z-score software
so<00:03:13.489> for<00:03:13.790> 3500<00:03:14.599> I<00:03:14.690> have<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> very<00:03:15.019> impressive

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
so for 3500 I have a very impressive

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.190 
so for 3500 I have a very impressive
setup<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:16.400> having<00:03:16.700> having<00:03:17.030> used<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.510> for<00:03:17.750> some

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
setup so having having used it for some

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.410 
setup so having having used it for some
time<00:03:18.230> now<00:03:18.440> is<00:03:18.859> this<00:03:19.760> something<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.150> you

time now is this something that you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.690 
time now is this something that you
would<00:03:21.260> recommend<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:22.160> other<00:03:22.280> clinicians

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
would recommend to other clinicians

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.300 
would recommend to other clinicians
other<00:03:23.060> practitioners<00:03:23.859> other<00:03:24.859> people<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.280> your
