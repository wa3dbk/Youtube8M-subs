00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.950
 attention is a sensation and you know what 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 our planet has bears so small 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.790
 sizes that opportunity to see them 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 appears only under a microscope 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.900
 animals are first described in 1 1773 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 German poster beats his name 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 sounds like klein in particular 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.460
 which in Russian means 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.109
 little water bear name 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.679
 unique animal changed only 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.989
 By 1 1840, it became many times simpler for 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.960
 Tardigrade pronunciations 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.300
 or nimble so began to call the most 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.790
 hardy creature on our planet and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.579
 This is despite the fact that modern science 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.920
 It has been known for more than 900 visible sti 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.530
 tiller with a distribution area from 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.230
 Himalayas to the deep sea where the drops 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 the heights of their stay above sea level from 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.510
 minus 4 thousand meters with a pressure of 6000 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.129
 atmospheres up to plus 6 thousand meters 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.100
 survival abilities have become one of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.720
 main features of animals 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.150
 only animal able for long 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 years to fall into a state of anabiosis as 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 onset of favorable conditions 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 come to life doing this by drying 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 almost instantly when drying 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 sluggish pulls into their bodies 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.689
 limbs decreasing in volume taking 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600
 barrel shape 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.150
 she wax obstructing 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.780
 evaporation would still visit the open 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 space 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 sustain radiation levels thousands of times 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.900
 more human capabilities and this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 a little less than 500 70 thousand x-ray 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 exist without water for up to 10 years and skill 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 survive for 1 hour at 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.020
 air temperatures from 100 degrees 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.570
 Celsius among other things and the ability 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 transfer 8 hour cooling in liquid 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 helium to a temperature of minus 200 71 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.950
 degrees is at the size of an animal from 0 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.219
 1 to one and a half millimeters body structure 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 which is unique in its own way 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.250
 translucent torso consisting of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.439
 four segments and head 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 supplied with four pairs of short and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.980
 body live have mouth constituting 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.320
 a pair of sharp stilettos serving for 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.960
 perforation of food cell membranes then 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.620
 while feeding on stilt algae 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.780
 and moss 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 gave themselves sluggishness danger 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 represent pincers and foot tail key for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.990
 whom they serve prey 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.030
 slow moving in nature 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.030
 completely independent of her and 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.460
 water- borne by animals already 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.160
 tomorrow without her grandfather we can she 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.160
 be anywhere and maybe she already has
