00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello friends with you today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.339
 I want to show how to create 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.410
 additional partitions on the hard disk 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.870
 this will help us paragon 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.639
 partition manager 12 professional 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 where to download and how to install this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.140
 the program you can follow the link 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 higher and so in my case I will 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 add additional section under 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.250
 h is not necessarily the name that he 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.269
 You could choose any other 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.550
 the letter here I will show you how it is 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.070
 you can do this 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.410
 new sections and let's say either you have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 1c 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 not broken section just can 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 add him an additional section d 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.629
 Well, in general, how many sections do you want 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 only and add 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.579
 so in this case I will add 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.870
 fourth section 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.870
 so let's run the program 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.840
 go to the parameters of the wizard, select 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.899
 create partition 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:24.409
 we press further further now we select a disk with 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.920
 whom we want to pick up a place 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.860
 that we have a new section 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:39.439
 hard drive here let's say it is with us 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:46.659
 It is so to speak a new section that's it 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:51.679
 indicated here is the maximum 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.200
 the size of our future is there or rather it 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.259
 no maximum size just on disk d 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.470
 I will borrow from me 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:06.549
 I have a place to take 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.549
 17 gigabytes here we can specify 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 how much we need and how you see with 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.340
 of our d drive 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.910
 more precisely, instead of being taken well, more precisely with 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.900
 disk d decreases place well here today 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.740
 noticed was let's say 40 and when we 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.380
 move our slider place 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.380
 decreases thereby adding to our 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.070
 new section so after we 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.160
 have chosen 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:47.330
 the size of our future section is new 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:52.190
 we press further now we select file 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.280
 system in which will be our section 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.880
 be this here two 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.230
 common 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.170
 common file system 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:08.900
 This is fat32 and ntfs I will leave it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.970
 ntfs file system you can choose 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.100
 32 each 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.120
 what you need is desirable so that all 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.150
 file systems all partitions were 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.440
 same file system I think so 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.820
 in principle, but generally you can do them 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.410
 different principle something like this 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.300
 choose volume label this name 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.380
 let's say we just write a local disk e 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.510
 or already on this case we have a disk 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:50.080
 we can change to any other letter 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.080
 there m or your name there I do not know 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.050
 in general, any choose let's say up 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:02.900
 Aroma here any bug choose 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.720
 write a new volume as it will be called 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.050
 do well or just click on call 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.110
 him 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.160
 local disk m will click next 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.010
 We confirm everything is not all the program 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.340
 she will ask to restart the computer 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.110
 it will ask for reload well actually 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.550
 and all if there was useful information 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.830
 put likes subscribe to my channel 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.830
 good luck with you sam
