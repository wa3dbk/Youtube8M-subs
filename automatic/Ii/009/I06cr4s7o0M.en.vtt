 little hat of the first use in the rs 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.190
 then ronaldo jr according to the defender 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.680
 Guy lay on the floor and then I 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.410
 to score this beautiful goal soon in the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.739
 staff very beginning I used the bid rs 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.539
 is the total amount in field 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.510
 flick okay to take the first 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.929
 defender and then came the second 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.540
 defender not even a crazy when trying 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.190
 cut the ball there I did I noticed 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.950
 The face was running toward the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.150
 background in so little time using it there 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.590
 ronaldo shops at personal 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.290
 This beautiful goal again for you there more 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.410
 once and in the replay for you to see with 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:30.560
 a detail what happened in all this 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:35.000
 throw well look there the defender on the ground and 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 ball at the bottom of the net and let's go next 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.410
 goal and the next one will be those who do not 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.480
 looks beautifully to cut the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.480
 defender and there came three to leave 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.460
 totally free in the saeed area and I just 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.040
 I had the job of crossing there that I was 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 very free in the crowd was very easy 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.070
 it was only two defenders closing me 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 I used the spirit mech to cut in half 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.510
 It's okay, everyone looks well. 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.790
 and then I was completely free to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.239
 make this crossing a very expensive 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.540
 in the area only on the other hand if you 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.640
 come and go three players closing me and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.630
 when trying to dribble there practically 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.880
 It would be impossible to spend there, right? 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.100
 then the best option was the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.340
 cross to score goal for the next 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.560
 Ball ball rap sound sending me 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.620
 I remember the flick and carretilla hat 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.160
 person looks just there to give 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.530
 one will embellish in the throw and send the bomb 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.880
 This is my personal objective that I saw 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.230
 that laps in the middle 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.270
 you can observe that the defender 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.130
 are thousand applications and had one of 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.070
 players from hypermarcas unmarked 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.650
 avoided the exit and then I decide to 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.510
 do a good job flick sending a bomb to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.270
 the bottom of the goal with no chance for the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.170
 goalkeeper catch look there is no repeat 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.240
 you 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.060
 remembering that the rambo flexa totaling 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.070
 number 10 o the mall christmas is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 in the total loss of this number 8 is the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.130
 first goal 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.550
 It's good that beckham flick is on 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.610
 future to number 13 next go 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.710
 look there the ramires catching the ball left in the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.410
 half of two defenders 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.010
 everything has a personal look, that goal I did 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.170
 only using my directional is okay 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.570
 a line to the pump to the bottom of the goal 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.500
 not for you to go out in a replay guys 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.530
 beautiful ramiro forgets to crate 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:41.030
 but we can mark it occasionally 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:43.570
 a goal with him sending the ball in the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.030
 goalkeeper's angle 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.959
 the next goal to close video 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.530
 buffet shop spinning 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.260
 My heaven god looks only to stay in the area and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.900
 This Comrade Fan of Fluminense 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.030
 sent to the bottom of the network 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.370
 the southern goalkeeper with the team 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.970
 look only the first floor of the mag shopping 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.900
 both total taxes 24 and 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.799
 sequence look like I see soon 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.720
 behind defender number 5 he a space 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.570
 free and I see face running in my 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.479
 So personal direction this time that you 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.729
 have to think in front of the opponent and 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.440
 know where your dribble goes away only 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.419
 I passed in the middle of him another defender 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.030
 danced also that he tried to cover 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.449
 on the other hand it is free and gives the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.289
 foot to the bottom of the net marked person 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.940
 Beautiful goal and with the bone rain 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.010
