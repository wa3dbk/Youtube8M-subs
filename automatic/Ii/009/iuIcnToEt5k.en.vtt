00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.640
 ribery in a team a kind 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 Brazilian hybrid bundesliga well 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
 strange but that worked rather well 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.399
 I really did not play 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.930
 yesterday the first four five clips of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.700
 the review its average quality because i have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.860
 shot from my live yesterday where I tested the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.879
 franck ribery so I apologize but 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 do not worry behind me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.570
 catch up with the quality really 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.739
 good and as it's magazine players 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 blue guys I'm going to ask you in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.100
 the more francky it is our francky 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 national who is disgusted because she 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.789
 unfortunately not had the golden ball I 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 ask you to swing from 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.610
 swing a max of blue thumbs for 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 pay tribute to those francky ribery 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.380
 So that's all for it's all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 for this intro of this review so 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.539
 Franck Ribery team of the year is between 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 in the heart of the subject what is it 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.289
 can say of him so in the points 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.300
 negatives moan tso and head game 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.740
 it's really an existing that side 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.420
 franck ribery is nothing else to say 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.000
 he really is really really very 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 bad of our this area it's true 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.209
 that there are people going to tell me but 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.590
 for a winger that absolutely nothing goethe 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.970
 is low less the way that plays but he 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 very much in the focus and when 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.940
 I center down times that's for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 the attacker is the winger who in point 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
 penalty and it may be useful 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.399
 to be there to put the head and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.649
 franck ribery he can not do that 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.810
 who can not do that so I put his 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.509
 head game and its stats stats in jump in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 the negatives messi has largely 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.099
 better head game than him after need 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.539
 to say that well, that's not what makes 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.310
 that I have I will lower his grade 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.810
 in spite of that I'm still going to 20 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.849
 20 passes it is really exceptional 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.840
 I want I will answer for those who 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.890
 are going to ask me but what is it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.300
 better than messi I saw besides 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.039
 yesterday in life I did people from 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.350
 ask that no I did not really like it 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.000
 that messi he is very very good but 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.500
 it's not worth it by lionel messi or 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.630
 even one animate which imhoff of 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.959
 say after that a hall player it's 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.580
 true but it is enormously decisive 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.560
 it's true that's true on that side 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 but I do not have that much that makes 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 that a madman a messi or when the arms 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.770
 even though I took a lot of fun 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.150
 with playing with so the franck 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.470
 ribery the positive points the shots of 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.730
 foot stopped so that pulls very well the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 corner the free kicks you could 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.520
 see that I put a 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.930
 then it is true that it was I 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.370
 I completely forgot to film this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.920
 match so I recovered at the end in 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 the gameplay but hey I've put a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.489
 free kick with g on corners I 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.100
 only makes a decisive pass I 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.870
 believe even if I pulled and I have 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.190
 pulled I pulled a lot and they were 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.870
 it is especially well drawn defenders 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.459
 who make the defenders or the players 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 of the head that took the balloons badly 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.280
 it went anywhere but always 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.390
 is it that at the level of the kicks 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.489
 stopped they really pull very well 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.440
 his physical then his physique of people 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.450
 may wonder if and what holds 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.950
 well on his legs in the river I 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 a lot of rage and you know what it was 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.980
 not good physically etc 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.090
 but finally I realized 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.250
 after several games that holds 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.810
 really good on his legs and he has this 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.459
 little side as messi or he has 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.959
 a lot of favorable counters 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.959
 that is, even when the guy is going 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.489
 to succeed to you move I am the ribery 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.780
 will succeed in fighting and recovering the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.299
 balloon behind so that's really 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.370
 a big positive point so the physical 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.630
 the enemy as in the positives 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.100
 after the speed will invite her to 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.579
 do not speak he is really very very very 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.109
 very quickly 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.400
 its pass quality it has a very good 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.570
 vision of the game plus a very good 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.310
 pass quality so they send out 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.510
 caviars it's true that I did not do 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.579
 as many assists that I would have 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.650
 I would have liked to do it with him but 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.850
 I was more in mode in finisher mode 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.799
 I use them a bit like a Ronaldo 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.989
 that is to say the winger really 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.459
 really ultra offensive is really 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.290
 aggressive who scores goals 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.640
 and that's what I did with everything 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.980
 simply with this franck ribery has 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.090
 so I scored a lot of goals not 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.859
 a lot of assists but 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.720
 a lot of goals so good fingers it's fine 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.340
 I compensated in an area of which you 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.720
 in front of the cages he is very good 93 in 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.730
 long finish hot power of 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.109
 it's heavy it sends very 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.780
 very big hit even if it's true 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.510
 that I have failed to illustrate this side 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.260
 this longshot side and all because bah 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.650
 I did not manage to get everything 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.390
 simply 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.290
 but still is it that there will be 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.849
 medium if you buy it that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.079
 try it there will be way of removing the 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.180
 lot it's just that I do not have 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.799
 technically successful technically it's 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.730
 a feast 5 stars technical gestures he 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.870
 has both feet besides four 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.079
 bad foot stars to go back there 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.940
 above 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.620
 five-star technical gesture a stat in 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.690
 dribble I know more how much but a 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.949
 huge stat over 90 so 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.500
 technically you're enjoying yourself so for 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.030
 scooters me who loves hell it's 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.979
 the heavy is very heavy for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.030
 the scooters the mcgeady spin that out 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.400
 ultra quickly 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.720
 it's fluid and it hurts the dea 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.850
 have also here we start the two 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.020
 last clips of this review and for 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.840
 me it's the two most beautiful goals that 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.490
 I scored with so 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 So here is the franck ribery is 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.340
 really very very good positioning he 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.370
 is not difficult to find 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.479
 he really takes his side and me 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.039
 I really liked it 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.960
 liked positioning the not difficult to 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.400
 find as I said and so that's it 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.380
 so franck ribery it's really a 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.820
 very very good player an excellent player 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.669
 I even had a lot of fun 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.440
 play with and so I thank you again 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.520
 once at bns is this because it's 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.720
 thanks to you that I could do this 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.490
 review so that I could try to 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.590
 Franck Ribery I really did not plan 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.389
 to test it but hey it was proposed to me 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.500
 we will propose to lend it so I 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.000
 am saying beautiful turf to do the review 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.020
 especially when asked, we do not 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.520
 not as many people and that of 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.110
 ronald de totti I'm still asked 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.060
 but unfortunately I can not find any 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.139
 lenders so that will wait for the franck 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.849
 ribery there you could see the last 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.590
 clip so there mcgeady speed the hook 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.599
 followed by the scooter directly from the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.159
 big hit in the small net so 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.449
 franck ribéry's assessment team of their 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.710
 so I put the note in front of you because 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.479
 that you could see he's really 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.130
 really very very good in points 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.530
 negatives moan at the head game 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.289
 this is for me it's really the only one 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.120
 something that a little disappointed me at home 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.380
 we know that I did not expect either 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.270
 to what they take balloons from the 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.919
 head all the time but at least they 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.030
 take a little bit worth a little 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.050
 bit like that from time to time 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.220
 can steal a ball from the head 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.419
 but that's not the case it does not happen 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.280
 at all it is really rotten of the 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.570
 head in the positive points so the 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.389
 kicks stopped and made to fly 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.159
 game vision dribble finish speed 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.860
 he goes too much he goes very fast too fast 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.510
 same longhot physical ball check 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.590
 positioning as I explained the 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.990
 always went very well 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.580
 very well placed rather not spend four 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.349
 wrong foot star quality passes 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.460
 punching power 5 and todd gesture 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.550
 technique is so there you see the 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.530
 score with fourteen games 18 goals 5-3 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.760
 from here so really a very very very 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.230
 very good track record for a lane player 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.520
 for a side player and so here is 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.930

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.760
