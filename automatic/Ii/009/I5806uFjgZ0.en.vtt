00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
so mounts up to the original holes in

00:00:47.780 --> 00:01:09.300 
so mounts up to the original holes in
the<00:00:47.900> dash<00:00:48.080> under<00:00:48.350> here

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.970 

and<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.520> shaved<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.440> four-speed<00:01:12.440> hole<00:01:12.620> in<00:01:12.830> a

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
and then I shaved a four-speed hole in a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.080 
and then I shaved a four-speed hole in a
tranny<00:01:13.280> tunnel<00:01:13.670> there

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090

much<00:02:56.709> else<00:02:56.950> back<00:02:57.250> here<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.550> guess<00:02:57.820> built<00:02:58.420> those

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
much else back here I guess built those

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.930 
much else back here I guess built those
little<00:02:58.959> body<00:02:59.170> mounts<00:02:59.530> there<00:02:59.739> they<00:03:00.489> go<00:03:00.640> through

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
little body mounts there they go through

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.449 
little body mounts there they go through
and<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.209> they're<00:03:01.330> reinforced<00:03:01.959> inside<00:03:02.459> just

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
and then they're reinforced inside just

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.870 
and then they're reinforced inside just
to<00:03:03.610> keep<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.290> keep<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.440> from<00:03:05.560> moving

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
to keep it from keep it from moving

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.070 
to keep it from keep it from moving
there's<00:03:06.880> already<00:03:07.060> four<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> floor<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.020> I

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
there's already four on the floor but I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.270 
there's already four on the floor but I
figured<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.500> overkill<00:03:09.010> ain't<00:03:09.160> gonna

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
figured a little overkill ain't gonna

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.970 
figured a little overkill ain't gonna
hurt<00:03:09.489> on<00:03:10.030> something<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.510> this

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 

I<00:03:17.069> had<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> trim<00:03:18.030> some<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.420> inner<00:03:18.569> fender

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
I had to trim some of that inner fender

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.580 
I had to trim some of that inner fender
there<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.540> filled<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.959> back<00:03:22.080> in<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.440> make<00:03:22.530> it

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
there and I filled it back in to make it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.800 
there and I filled it back in to make it
look<00:03:22.739> okay<00:03:25.099> waiting<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.310> brake<00:03:26.760> booster<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
look okay waiting on the brake booster I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.860 
look okay waiting on the brake booster I
bought<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> 7<00:03:28.739> inch<00:03:28.860> dual<00:03:29.159> diaphragm<00:03:29.909> street

bought a 7 inch dual diaphragm street
rod<00:03:31.049> booster<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.560> ebay<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:31.920> think<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.340> like

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
rod booster on ebay I think it's like

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.050 
rod booster on ebay I think it's like
110<00:03:33.090> bucks<00:03:34.129> I'm<00:03:35.129> at<00:03:35.250> them<00:03:35.400> custom<00:03:35.910> make

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
110 bucks I'm at them custom make

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.640 
110 bucks I'm at them custom make
everything<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.690> again<00:03:37.049> -<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.530> that's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
everything for that again - but that's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.030 
everything for that again - but that's
okay<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.519> should<00:03:38.580> work<00:03:38.819> good<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.360> I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
okay it should work good for this I

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.080 
okay it should work good for this I
could<00:03:41.040> add<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.670> booster

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
could add you get a little booster

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.270 
could add you get a little booster
because<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.810> right<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.799> really<00:03:44.069> close

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
because this right here is really close

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.940 
because this right here is really close
to<00:03:44.310> brake<00:03:44.700> booster<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.810> anything<00:03:46.560> bigger<00:03:46.739> than

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
to brake booster so anything bigger than

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.920 
to brake booster so anything bigger than
like<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.129> 7-inch<00:03:47.610> should<00:03:47.760> be<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
like a 7-inch should be just be in the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.150 
like a 7-inch should be just be in the
way<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.500> come<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.640> little<00:03:50.879> one<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.120> that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
I've been trying to figure out this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.900 
I've been trying to figure out this
wheel<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.360> tire<00:03:54.660> set<00:03:54.959> up<00:03:55.140> oh<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:56.010> guess<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.849> know

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
wheel and tire set up oh I guess I know

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.280 
wheel and tire set up oh I guess I know
the<00:03:57.000> wheel<00:03:57.329> setup<00:03:57.660> but<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.900> don't<00:03:58.079> know<00:03:58.140> what

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
the wheel setup but I don't know what

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.210 
the wheel setup but I don't know what
size<00:03:58.470> tire<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.859> want<00:03:59.129> how<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.209> got<00:04:00.420> these<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:01.220> got

size tire I want how I got these I got

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.369 
size tire I want how I got these I got
these<00:04:02.340> bias<00:04:02.640> plies<00:04:03.030> -<00:04:03.959> 2575<00:04:04.950> 15s<00:04:05.579> for<00:04:05.730> free<00:04:06.000> I

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
these bias plies - 2575 15s for free I

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.449 
these bias plies - 2575 15s for free I
kind<00:04:07.379> of<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.650> use<00:04:07.799> them<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:07.980> like<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> bias

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
kind of like to use them I like the bias

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.819 
kind of like to use them I like the bias
probably<00:04:08.879> look<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.150> these<00:04:09.329> trucks<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.959> then

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
probably look on these trucks and then

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.059 
probably look on these trucks and then
I'll<00:04:10.920> just<00:04:11.069> paint<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.430> some<00:04:11.700> white<00:04:11.879> walls<00:04:13.069> this

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
I'll just paint on some white walls this

tires<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.680> problem<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.039> have<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:20.190> these<00:04:20.539> so

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
tires the problem I have with these so

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.529 
tires the problem I have with these so
you<00:04:21.630> look<00:04:21.810> close<00:04:22.160> if<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.370> tub<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.000> tub<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.389> out

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
you look close if I tub if I tub it out

you look close if I tub if I tub it out
it<00:04:25.020> looks<00:04:25.169> like<00:04:25.229> it's<00:04:25.410> gonna<00:04:25.530> hit<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.800> that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
it looks like it's gonna hit on that

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.120 
it looks like it's gonna hit on that
hood<00:04:26.160> hinge<00:04:26.400> there<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> guess<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.889> don't<00:04:28.919> know

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
hood hinge there so I guess I don't know

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.589 
hood hinge there so I guess I don't know
I<00:04:29.160> don't<00:04:29.430> know<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:29.849> got<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.330> people

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
usually do about that might just end up

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.480 
usually do about that might just end up
taking<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.389> hood<00:04:33.570> hinge<00:04:33.979> trimming<00:04:34.979> it<00:04:35.130> and

I've got my switch box rounds are here
I've<00:06:22.820> got<00:06:22.970> a<00:06:23.000> rewire<00:06:23.420> some<00:06:23.690> stuff<00:06:23.960> some<00:06:24.170> stuff

pretty<00:06:34.360> excited<00:06:34.779> oh<00:06:34.930> and<00:06:35.139> then<00:06:35.229> I<00:06:35.289> got<00:06:35.499> the

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
pretty excited oh and then I got the

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.459 
pretty excited oh and then I got the
steering<00:06:36.879> here<00:06:37.120> it's<00:06:37.719> not<00:06:37.900> perfect<00:06:38.349> it

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
steering here it's not perfect it

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.839 
steering here it's not perfect it
wobbles<00:06:38.889> a<00:06:38.979> little<00:06:39.009> when<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.460> turn<00:06:39.639> it<00:06:39.759> when

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
wobbles a little when you turn it when

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.689 
wobbles a little when you turn it when
you<00:06:39.939> do<00:06:40.089> turn<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.479> because<00:06:40.990> it's<00:06:41.139> got<00:06:41.319> one

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
you do turn it because it's got one

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.779 
you do turn it because it's got one
joint<00:06:42.699> there<00:06:43.800> then<00:06:44.800> that's<00:06:44.919> another<00:06:45.490> joint

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
joint there then that's another joint

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.119 
joint there then that's another joint
there<00:06:46.059> and<00:06:46.360> then<00:06:47.020> a<00:06:47.110> rag<00:06:47.559> joint<00:06:47.889> which<00:06:48.009> is

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
there and then a rag joint which is

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.339 
there and then a rag joint which is
technically<00:06:48.520> a<00:06:48.639> joint<00:06:49.059> so<00:06:49.749> the<00:06:49.930> steering

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
technically a joint so the steering

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.010 
technically a joint so the steering
column<00:06:50.589> wobbles<00:06:51.219> the<00:06:52.089> moment<00:06:52.749> that<00:06:52.870> this

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
column wobbles the moment that this

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.159 
column wobbles the moment that this
moves<00:06:53.319> or<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:53.889> this<00:06:54.249> shaft<00:06:54.520> wobbles<00:06:55.120> so<00:06:56.110> I'm

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
moves or the this shaft wobbles so I'm

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.379 
moves or the this shaft wobbles so I'm
gonna<00:06:56.259> use<00:06:56.409> this<00:06:56.589> bearing<00:06:57.550> here<00:06:57.960> basically<00:06:58.960> I

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389 
gonna use this bearing here basically I

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.999 
gonna use this bearing here basically I
gotta<00:07:01.389> make<00:07:01.659> a<00:07:01.719> custom<00:07:02.169> own<00:07:02.289> for<00:07:02.529> that<00:07:02.680> and

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
gotta make a custom own for that and

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.629 
gotta make a custom own for that and
then<00:07:03.490> mount<00:07:03.729> that<00:07:04.169> right<00:07:05.169> here<00:07:05.469> see<00:07:06.460> that's

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
then mount that right here see that's

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.529 
then mount that right here see that's
the<00:07:06.999> same<00:07:07.180> size<00:07:07.419> right<00:07:07.689> here<00:07:07.839> it<00:07:07.930> works<00:07:08.080> good

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
the same size right here it works good

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.579 
the same size right here it works good
it's<00:07:10.539> gonna<00:07:10.659> be<00:07:10.749> kind<00:07:10.960> of<00:07:10.990> pain<00:07:11.229> in<00:07:11.319> the<00:07:11.379> butt

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:11.589 
it's gonna be kind of pain in the butt

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:13.739 
it's gonna be kind of pain in the butt
because<00:07:11.740> I<00:07:11.919> got<00:07:12.099> the<00:07:12.419> everything<00:07:13.419> down<00:07:13.569> there

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
I got the upper a arms and then you

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.939 
I got the upper a arms and then you
can't<00:07:16.779> really<00:07:16.899> see<00:07:17.110> but<00:07:17.259> there's<00:07:17.439> a<00:07:17.529> bag<00:07:17.740> won't

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
directly below it so it's kind of all on

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.399 
directly below it so it's kind of all on
the<00:07:20.889> way<00:07:21.009> there<00:07:21.689> they<00:07:22.689> say<00:07:22.870> you<00:07:22.960> got<00:07:23.110> to<00:07:23.139> do<00:07:23.319> it

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.350 
the way there they say you got to do it
to<00:07:23.529> the<00:07:23.620> frame<00:07:23.889> you<00:07:24.370> can't<00:07:24.610> just<00:07:24.789> do<00:07:24.909> it<00:07:25.059> to<00:07:25.180> the

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
to the frame you can't just do it to the

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.009 
to the frame you can't just do it to the
inner<00:07:26.259> fender<00:07:26.349> but
