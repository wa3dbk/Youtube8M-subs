there's because I try to make it look
like<00:01:54.040> coal<00:01:54.610> as<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.960> see<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.560> corner<00:01:56.890> it's

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
like coal as you see in one corner it's

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.680 
like coal as you see in one corner it's
light<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.580> one<00:01:57.760> corner<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.270> dark<00:01:58.540> so<00:01:59.490> ya

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
light in one corner it's dark so ya

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.570 
light in one corner it's dark so ya
still<00:02:01.690> got<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.020> old<00:02:02.050> cobblestone<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:06.520> we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
still got the old cobblestone now we

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.000 
still got the old cobblestone now we
have<00:02:07.030> sand<00:02:07.480> because<00:02:07.990> some<00:02:08.290> people<00:02:08.590> wanted<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
have sand because some people wanted to

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.010 
have sand because some people wanted to
compress<00:02:09.790> end<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.390> reason<00:02:10.690> why<00:02:10.840> it's

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
compress end and the reason why it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.050 
compress end and the reason why it's
nine<00:02:11.380> instead<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.980> four<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.460> because<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.940> know

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
nine instead of four is because you know

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.520 
nine instead of four is because you know
mix<00:02:13.360> sandstone<00:02:16.860> compressed<00:02:17.860> sand<00:02:19.320> still<00:02:20.320> got

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
mix sandstone compressed sand still got

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.100 
mix sandstone compressed sand still got
mossy<00:02:21.190> stone<00:02:21.580> even<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.060> small<00:02:22.510> stone<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
mossy stone even a small stone the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.870 
mossy stone even a small stone the
reason<00:02:23.380> why<00:02:23.470> i<00:02:23.530> put<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.830> most<00:02:24.070> owners<00:02:24.610> because

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
reason why i put it most owners because

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.750 
reason why i put it most owners because
the<00:02:25.390> mossy<00:02:26.200> stone<00:02:26.470> has<00:02:26.740> Moss<00:02:27.100> stone<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the mossy stone has Moss stone as the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
the mossy stone has Moss stone as the
name<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.120> well<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.570> then<00:02:29.500> red<00:02:29.709> stone<00:02:30.010> that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
name as well and then red stone that

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.550 
name as well and then red stone that
will<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:30.580> changed<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.330> can<00:02:31.540> give<00:02:31.750> off<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.990> an

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
will be changed so it can give off a an

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.270 
will be changed so it can give off a an
output<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.820> an<00:02:34.350> always-on<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> redstone

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
output like an always-on like a redstone

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.090 
output like an always-on like a redstone
torch<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.270> can't<00:02:37.540> turn<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> off<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:38.980> you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
torch but you can't turn it off but you

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.250 
torch but you can't turn it off but you
know<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> haven't<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.690> stage<00:02:40.810> of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
know I haven't got to that stage of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.360 
know I haven't got to that stage of
modding<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.540> yeah<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.050> I've<00:02:44.260> changed<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
modding so yeah and I've changed the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.240 
modding so yeah and I've changed the
compressed<00:02:46.150> Cole<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.750> actually<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.410> there<00:02:48.040> now

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
compressed Cole so actually is there now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.420 
compressed Cole so actually is there now
you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.700> use<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.090> fuel<00:02:49.510> its<00:02:50.500> melts<00:02:51.010> thirty

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you can use as a fuel its melts thirty

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.660 
you can use as a fuel its melts thirty
two<00:02:51.760> blocks<00:02:52.150> cuz<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:54.250> make<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.580> out

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
two blocks cuz you know you make it out

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.860 
two blocks cuz you know you make it out
of<00:02:54.850> 4<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.480> 4<00:02:55.510> times<00:02:55.810> 8<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.650> obviously<00:02:57.610> 32<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
of 4 so 4 times 8 is obviously 32 the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.050 
of 4 so 4 times 8 is obviously 32 the
reason<00:02:59.200> why<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.709> 4<00:03:00.040> times<00:03:00.250> 8<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.550> because<00:03:00.940> it's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
reason why is 4 times 8 is because it's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.630 
reason why is 4 times 8 is because it's
made<00:03:01.239> with<00:03:01.450> for<00:03:01.720> coal<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.290> each<00:03:02.800> coal<00:03:03.160> smelts

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
made with for coal and each coal smelts

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.670 
made with for coal and each coal smelts
8<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.300> x<00:03:04.690> over<00:03:04.870> before<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.320> get<00:03:05.620> 32<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:08.230> you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
8 so x over before you get 32 and if you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.729 
8 so x over before you get 32 and if you
put<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.310> compress<00:03:09.760> sand<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.510> will<00:03:10.989> smell<00:03:11.320> 9

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
put in the compress sand it will smell 9

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.190 
put in the compress sand it will smell 9
glass<00:03:12.220> straight<00:03:12.910> away<00:03:13.269> since<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.050> is

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
glass straight away since it is

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.250 
glass straight away since it is
compressed<00:03:14.830> compressed<00:03:15.640> sand<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.870> will

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
compressed compressed sand so it will

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.970 
compressed compressed sand so it will
smell<00:03:17.500> unites<00:03:18.090> glass<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.230> there

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
smell unites glass as you see here there

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
smell unites glass as you see here there
you<00:03:21.040> go<00:03:21.750> some<00:03:22.750> people<00:03:22.989> might<00:03:23.110> go<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.410> it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
you go some people might go I it's

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.290 
you go some people might go I it's
cheating<00:03:23.980> but<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.489> know<00:03:24.610> it's<00:03:24.760> single<00:03:25.120> player

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
cheating but you know it's single player

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.390 
cheating but you know it's single player
who<00:03:25.630> are<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.900> cheating<00:03:26.440> you're<00:03:27.100> not<00:03:27.220> really

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.420 
just a mod I don't see how mods are
cheating<00:03:35.019> unless<00:03:35.140> it's<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.890> mod<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.100> gives

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
cheating unless it's a mod that gives

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.170 
cheating unless it's a mod that gives
you<00:03:36.489> diamonds<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.269> put<00:03:37.450> dirt<00:03:37.840> in
