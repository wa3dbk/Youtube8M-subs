How's it going everybody Justin here, got
some stuff in the mail today, Project 325

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.340
as you can see in the viewfinder here.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.830
For those of you that know how to read.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.019
Apex Arc 8's my new wheels came in today so
gonna un-box these real quick and get them

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.970
out I did get the 17 by 9's in silver color
and let's open them up and take a look.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:46.370
Alright as you can see I'm trying out my new
dual capture mode on my phone here not getting

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.030
the tape very well.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
This allows me to use the front camera and
the back camera I'm not sure how it's gonna

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.190
look but we'll see.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:09.561
These are taped all the way across, these
have been sitting in here all afternoon and

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:25.160
just now getting to opening them up and taking
a look...so.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:56.890
kinda of difficult to do one handed but well
packaged, see if I can get it out of there.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.939
and I'm gonna need two hands, alright I got
them out of the box finally, a little tricky

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.770
getting them out there with one hand.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:21.430
Plastic rim edge protector thingy, cool. and
of course nice felt covers.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:35.489
Nice and wide 9 inch rim, very cool, and I
did have the center cap here in the bag, I'll

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:50.709
probably put stock BMW ones in there because
they do fit as well.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.870
But there we go, step one, next thing will
be tires and hopefully suspension in a month

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.580
or two here when I get a little bit more cash
for the project, but uhh we are started.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.460
Hope you enjoyed the video, thanks guys for
watching.
