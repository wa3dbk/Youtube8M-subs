that's<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> norm<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.770> most

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

churches<00:00:50.489> today<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.149> completely<00:00:51.360> apostate

churches today are completely apostate

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.360 
churches today are completely apostate
and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> reasons

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and I think that's one of the reasons

why<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.210> many<00:00:54.239> Bible<00:00:54.719> believing<00:00:54.989> Christians
