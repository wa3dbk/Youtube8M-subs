out of materials that are going to last

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
out of materials that are going to last
you<00:00:36.750> pretty<00:00:37.079> well<00:00:37.140> forever<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:38.550> simply<00:00:38.940> fits

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you pretty well forever it simply fits

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.680 
you pretty well forever it simply fits
into<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.860> vertical<00:00:40.860> rod<00:00:41.219> holder<00:00:41.640> there's<00:00:42.420> Jason

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
into a vertical rod holder there's Jason

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.720 
into a vertical rod holder there's Jason
here<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.140> illustrate<00:00:44.719> you<00:00:45.719> turn<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> around

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
here will illustrate you turn it around

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.380 
here will illustrate you turn it around
so<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> guide<00:00:49.070> locks<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.309> position<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
so the guide locks into position for the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.630 
so the guide locks into position for the
setting<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> long<00:00:52.680> line<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.520> be

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
setting of the long line it has to be

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.420 
setting of the long line it has to be
that<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.969> when<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> bring<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> long<00:00:55.440> line<00:00:55.649> up

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that way when you bring the long line up

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.670 
that way when you bring the long line up
to<00:00:56.879> retrieve<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.719> turn<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> around<00:00:58.260> 180

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to retrieve it you turn it around 180

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
to retrieve it you turn it around 180
and<00:00:59.609> put<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> guide<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> outward

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and put the guide in the outward

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
and put the guide in the outward
position<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
position and that's pretty much how it's

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.719 
position and that's pretty much how it's
set<00:01:05.549> up

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
set up

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.789

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
right we've just set a clip the boy to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
right we've just set a clip the boy to
the<00:01:10.830> end<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> drop<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> line<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.409> Jason's

and there will be an orange tag that
comes<00:01:28.050> out<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:28.740> close<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.280> where<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> hooks

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
comes out very close to where the hooks

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.300 
comes out very close to where the hooks
are<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> Jason<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.560> illustrate<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.250> the

there's no no hard work with this one

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
there's no no hard work with this one
you<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:23.840> let<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.230> go<00:02:24.350> out<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:24.739> by<00:02:24.920> itself<00:02:25.250> you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you just let it go out all by itself you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.220 
you just let it go out all by itself you
make<00:02:25.880> sure<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.300> hooks<00:02:26.480> when<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> bait<00:02:27.020> them

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
make sure you hooks when you bait them

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.100 
make sure you hooks when you bait them
are<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.560> pointing<00:02:28.010> outwards<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.819> the

are all pointing outwards is the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.720 
are all pointing outwards is the
centripetal<00:02:30.110> force<00:02:30.560> will<00:02:30.860> tend<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.459> throw

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
centripetal force will tend to throw

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:51.270

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.219 

just<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.520> one<00:06:30.729> slowly<00:06:31.060> Jason<00:06:31.599> says<00:06:31.780> he<00:06:31.960> says

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
just the one slowly Jason says he says

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.779 
just the one slowly Jason says he says
he's<00:06:32.410> bringing<00:06:32.590> it<00:06:32.860> around<00:06:32.949> anti-clockwise

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
he's bringing it around anti-clockwise

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.790 
he's bringing it around anti-clockwise
he<00:06:34.210> pulls<00:06:34.449> it<00:06:34.660> probably<00:06:35.080> halfway<00:06:35.319> around<00:06:35.620> the

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
he pulls it probably halfway around the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.740 
he pulls it probably halfway around the
reel<00:06:36.009> and<00:06:36.280> slop<00:06:36.580> just<00:06:36.909> drops<00:06:37.120> it<00:06:37.270> into<00:06:37.389> a<00:06:37.509> slot

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
reel and slop just drops it into a slot

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.920 
reel and slop just drops it into a slot
you<00:06:38.650> can<00:06:38.889> double<00:06:39.250> up<00:06:39.509> on<00:06:40.509> the<00:06:40.690> hook<00:06:40.840> but<00:06:42.930> it's

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
you can double up on the hook but it's

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.510 
you can double up on the hook but it's
better<00:06:44.139> to<00:06:44.409> try<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:44.770> get<00:06:44.889> the<00:06:45.009> individual

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
better to try and get the individual

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.909 
better to try and get the individual
slots<00:06:45.819> that's<00:06:46.090> why<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.330> 13<00:06:46.870> slots<00:06:47.169> is<00:06:47.740> the

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
slots that's why the 13 slots is the

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:58.570 
slots that's why the 13 slots is the
orange<00:06:48.159> peg<00:06:48.460> and<00:06:48.699> put<00:06:48.909> Gretel
