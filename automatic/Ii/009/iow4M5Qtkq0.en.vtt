00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.780
 two pieces of meat and divided into 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.840
 all the barbecue true that is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.550
 revolutionary but that is that in the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 oven also time this step of you in 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.120
 your barbecue you can put all kinds of 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 boar pork boar mammoth or in 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.540
 soap or pathological sweat there is monago the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.460
 bad bug will die ferrocat or cancer all 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.080
 the bar that is even fish not 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.030
 be a short whore without life enemies 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.620
 uses the old oven that I just had 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.940
 say a revolutionary invention that will do 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.380
 that preparing your meals is very 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.760
 fun comes with a mechanism 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.530
 incorporated that when it detects that the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.900
 meat is already made the strip by the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.220
 how cool your barbecue is too 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.610
 it served as an alarm if they tried to enter 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.610
 steal at home 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.590
 that's ridiculous not if you have a rhyme 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 with two points but for just the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 modest price that appears on the screen and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.479
 half of your kidney can you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.250
 enjoy this magnificent barbecue 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.060
 made with aluminum mercury lead and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.280
 nickel if I was already getting fed up with 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.979
 the old oven you know have to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.560
 put coal and all the meat of the blow 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.650
 It's very boring but since I bought the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.159
 BBQ 2.0 and pork chops no longer 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.159
 they are the same 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.530
 oh god let's kill 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.530
 I know 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.930
 but the 2.0 is not responsible for 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.220
 the natural catastrophes that you can 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.630
 produce or its high content of 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.950
 toxic products may pay its price 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.950
 like two one or two day terms
