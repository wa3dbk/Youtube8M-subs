you're<00:03:32.819> in<00:03:32.880> attacking<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.380> means<00:03:34.650> i<00:03:34.799> can

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
you're in attacking so this means i can

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
you're in attacking so this means i can
have<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.069> lot<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.489> work<00:03:35.700> cut<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.510> me

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.170 
one of my shotgun so yeah I think that's
17<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.890> we<00:03:40.980> need<00:03:41.100> eight<00:03:41.310> kills<00:03:41.609> with<00:03:41.820> shotgun

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
17 so we need eight kills with shotgun

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.270 
17 so we need eight kills with shotgun

anyway<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.580> wouldn't<00:04:32.850> be<00:04:32.910> good<00:04:33.030> enough<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.870> you

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
anyway so wouldn't be good enough so you

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.550 
anyway so wouldn't be good enough so you
know<00:04:34.229> it's<00:04:34.440> going<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.740> lot<00:04:34.889> more<00:04:36.440> side<00:04:37.440> of

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
know it's going to be a lot more side of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.800 
know it's going to be a lot more side of
me<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.010> can<00:04:38.130> see<00:04:38.310> earlier<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:39.150> i<00:04:39.479> was

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
me you can see earlier with i was

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.029 
me you can see earlier with i was
thought<00:04:39.990> about<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.410> i've<00:04:40.620> got<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.860> right

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
thought about that i've got the right

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.110 
thought about that i've got the right
show<00:04:41.220> because<00:04:41.400> i<00:04:41.460> don't<00:04:41.610> use<00:04:41.789> a<00:04:41.820> primary

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120

weapon it stops you from using primary

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.770 
weapon it stops you from using primary
that<00:04:43.560> means<00:04:43.710> i<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.979> use<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.940> know

here now you know it's cool you know
maybe<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.750> try<00:05:03.960> was<00:05:04.230> stopping<00:05:04.620> power<00:05:04.770> pro<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:05.160> do

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
maybe to try was stopping power pro I do

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.070 
maybe to try was stopping power pro I do
think<00:05:05.639> maybe<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:06.000> best<00:05:06.330> for<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.570> shot<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.870> see

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
think maybe a best for the shot you see

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.290 
think maybe a best for the shot you see
how<00:05:07.230> long<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.500> takes<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.770> reload<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:09.150> is<00:05:09.270> a

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
how long it takes to reload that is a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.640 
how long it takes to reload that is a
big<00:05:09.510> probably<00:05:09.870> know<00:05:09.990> that's<00:05:10.200> what<00:05:10.380> really

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
big probably know that's what really

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.070 
big probably know that's what really
puts<00:05:10.919> me<00:05:11.100> off<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.370> them<00:05:11.490> with<00:05:11.910> this<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.480> with

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
puts me off of them with this is with

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.510 
puts me off of them with this is with
the<00:05:13.139> shotgun<00:05:13.380> maybe<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.950> have<00:05:14.040> quick<00:05:14.250> reload

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
the shotgun maybe to have quick reload

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.220 
the shotgun maybe to have quick reload
but<00:05:14.880> then<00:05:15.030> ice<00:05:15.150> feeling<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.840> Mara<00:05:16.110> from

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
but then ice feeling that Mara from

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.690 
but then ice feeling that Mara from
