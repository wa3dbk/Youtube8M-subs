00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
all of these they work pretty well the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.359 
all of these they work pretty well the
only<00:01:09.360> issue<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.010> was

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
only issue I have with them I was

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.880 
only issue I have with them I was
actually<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.790> issues<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.900> preventable

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
actually two issues one is preventable

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.999 
actually two issues one is preventable
but<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.299> formula<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
but one is not the formula on these is a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.450 
but one is not the formula on these is a
matte<00:01:17.670> formula<00:01:17.909> therefore<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.650> drying<00:01:20.159> like

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
matte formula therefore it's drying like

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.020 
matte formula therefore it's drying like
most<00:01:20.759> lip<00:01:21.030> colors<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.930> ice<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:23.250> seems<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.880> be

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
most lip colors but ice it seems to be

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140 
most lip colors but ice it seems to be
if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> wear<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> lip<00:01:25.590> balm<00:01:25.770> underneath<00:01:26.310> they

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
if you wear a lip balm underneath they

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.810 
if you wear a lip balm underneath they
will<00:01:27.799> not<00:01:28.799> dry<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> lips<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.700> they

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
will not dry out your lips but they

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.870 
will not dry out your lips but they
won't<00:01:30.030> last<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.990> long<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.890> wear<00:01:32.729> them

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
won't last as long because I wear them

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
won't last as long because I wear them
um<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.159> no<00:01:35.280> lip<00:01:35.520> balm

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
um I put them on with no lip balm

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550 
um I put them on with no lip balm
underneath<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.570> by<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.930> end<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> day<00:01:37.409> my

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
underneath and by the end of the day my

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 
underneath and by the end of the day my
lips<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.460> bit<00:01:38.880> dry<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
lips are a little bit dry and but the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
lips are a little bit dry and but the
color<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.680> still<00:01:42.110> sort<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:44.159> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
color is still sort of there because I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
color is still sort of there because I
do<00:01:44.399> eat<00:01:44.939> throughout<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> day<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.140> lip

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
do eat throughout the day and then lip

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.819 
do eat throughout the day and then lip
color<00:01:46.770> obviously<00:01:47.040> wears<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:49.079> do

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
color obviously wears off but you do

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.859 
color obviously wears off but you do
still<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> same<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:53.149> matte<00:01:54.149> look<00:01:54.479> if

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
still get the same kind of matte look if

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.770 
still get the same kind of matte look if
you<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.530> wear<00:01:55.770> lip<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.159> underneath<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.600> other

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you do wear lip all underneath the other

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.320 

I<00:02:11.110> sink<00:02:12.110> pretty<00:02:13.010> sure<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.460> oh<00:02:13.790> yeah<00:02:14.060> like

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
it broke off at the stay and the other

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.190 
it broke off at the stay and the other
thing<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.600> um<00:02:21.370> these<00:02:22.370> do<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:24.020> go

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
thing is um these do like you do go

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.810 
thing is um these do like you do go
through<00:02:24.470> them<00:02:24.620> pretty<00:02:24.650> quickly<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.490> because

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
through them pretty quickly like because

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.100 
through them pretty quickly like because
they<00:02:26.570> are<00:02:26.720> such<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.080> small<00:02:27.500> stick<00:02:28.180> um<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.720> go

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
they are such a small stick um you do go

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
they are such a small stick um you do go
through<00:02:30.140> product<00:02:30.560> pretty<00:02:30.980> quickly<00:02:31.310> uh<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:32.560> do

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
through product pretty quickly uh I do

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.030 
through product pretty quickly uh I do
find<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.960> pencil<00:02:36.410> format<00:02:36.800> for

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
find that I like the pencil format for

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.910 
find that I like the pencil format for
applying<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.340> get<00:02:37.460> much<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:37.820> precision<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
applying you get much more precision and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.580 
applying you get much more precision and
you<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> lot<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.910> control<00:02:41.690> but<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.260> do<00:02:42.410> get

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you get a lot of control but you do get

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.880 
you get a lot of control but you do get
less<00:02:42.830> product<00:02:43.520> than<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.730> typical<00:02:44.000> lipstick

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
less product than a typical lipstick

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.550 
less product than a typical lipstick
which<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:47.180> these<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:47.960> you<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.170> any<00:02:48.260> large

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
make it question you aren't thinking

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.420 
make it question you aren't thinking
about<00:02:50.060> using<00:02:50.360> these<00:02:50.660> all<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.260> time<00:02:51.430> that's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
about using these all the time that's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.520 
about using these all the time that's
great<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:52.940> you're<00:02:53.270> not<00:02:54.170> going<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.470> be

out of them quite quickly but for three
dollars<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.660> big<00:03:12.020> splurge<00:03:12.380> to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
dollars it's not a big splurge to
