 Good luck, the moon went to the end of the line. 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.350
 beauty is good if you agree with me 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.750
 since the reviews I agree with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 You do not care about the elder. 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.070
 beautiful images that were unique and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.760
 ceará pays millionaire cache to fatima 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.410
 bernardes because it is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.030

 Bonner in the Globe Network 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.420
 This does not happen anymore because the fat 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.160
 2012 left the bench and left his 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.979

 her courage is not but life is the page 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.510
 he thought they would make money and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.360
 I would have a program of her because it is successful, right? 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.700
 this gave her the right to be able to do 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.950
 aside from merchandising and commercial and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.990
 of them is the harvest that now this year 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.660
 She closed commercials for Ceará for 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.209
 only real transmissions think you 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.580

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.100

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 chamber won 3 million reais because 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.120
 Fatima is the Fatima and you are you and me 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.370
 It's me we never got to the point at 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 the apex that the fatima has arrived but it is the life 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.530
 huh 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.430
 want to know more about this news access the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.570
 link is in the description for this video 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.520
 young emotional find car 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.010
 ghost left by his father in the game of 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.170
 because he is a young man from a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.630
 Xbox in 2001 that one of the boxy 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.790
 he had and when he made six 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.400
 years old his father unfortunately 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.930
 She died and he never found in 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.950
 even because it is a racing game 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.920
 those two 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.739
 the father and son played on the xbox console and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.810
 recently, almost ten years later 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.000
 the death of the father he took the console took 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.280
 the powder and went to play and discovered that he had the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.140
 record time his father in a game yet 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.730
 so he went to play the ghost car 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.620
 because in racing games, the car is 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.630
 ghost until you beat that record 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.250
 So boy got emotional because he did not 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.230
 remembered that he had remembered his father 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.540
 I was just playing a 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.070
 ghost car with record that in case 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 it was your father's 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.329
 This is very interesting, he said in the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.269
 video he made for YouTube and even 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.470
 said that he succeeded at some point 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.420
 beat record 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.220
 only when it arrived at the finish line 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.290
 there when it arrived on my arrival it is well 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.030
 abundant well but let's continue when 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.739
 arrived on my arrival he brake with 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.040
 all because he did not want to lose the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.560
 record of the late father looks what I 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.590
 I miss it now, try to hit it there. 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.799
 In the trash 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.360
 he knows how to do searches on google poll the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.710
 planet, that's if you thought 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.510
 do that school work and 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.310
 college on google is ecologically 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.590
 Correct, I'm going to ruin your party. 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.750
 because a beloved American 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 physical scientist discovered after 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.530
 a long time that Google pollutes yes 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.110
 planet and more than yahoo and bing 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 Why is google the fastest? 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.860
 everyone to give that answer that 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.960
 You both wait so he uses a 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.390
 It's a difficult system for that, he's using a 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.250
 differentiated system of servers 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.750
 integrated approach that makes the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.709
 is faster and also pollutes a lot 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.239
 more the planet 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.340
 if you want to be eco-friendly 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.780
 correct use and the street and bingo or any 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.300
 Unfortunately, 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.130
 that we will not want to do this for 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.500
