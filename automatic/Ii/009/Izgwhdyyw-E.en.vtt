00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.860
 today is a very good day 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 we can once again take a grab 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.800
 do from the indicating candy jar from 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.800
 mercedes-benz the hague 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.530
 and we have a very tasty candy too 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.910
 to grab 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.650
 the cls 63 amg shooting brake 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.250
 And then we also have the most 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.910
 brute version black to black black 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.270
 rims 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.500
 black body color and treated see 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.500
 that makes things bold 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.409
 he is equipped with a very for us 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.439
 known 5 to 518 bi-turbo 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.369
 5 158 hp and seven hundred twenty minutes 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.619
 meter and yes then just has 2p tickets 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.619
 less than the audi a6 and the ww and 5 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.380
 but just 40 minutes more and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.959
 you can feel that from the real piece more 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 pushing power than, for example, the er 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.200
 five 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.320
 striking that one should therefore how should that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.860
 controls how nicely it controls and yes best 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 well exactly i will mind it 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 where the 163 reason 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.770
 yes that send not super bit lol 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.180
 and this feels really delicious 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.180
 also said that the formatting is 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.780
 Yes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 the full of and take care of that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.459
 you can always use tracking 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.549
 but it does n't cause you to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.440
 and that is the sharpness of the knees 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.390
 and that makes it even sharper and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.390
 better to send than audi rs6 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.460
 you will have the cls 63 amg shooting turned out 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.220
 not see very often but if you want him 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.390
 see how my tanks wait young because yes 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.390
 you must do pretty 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.210
 but then refueled with your eyes closed 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.210
 we can continue 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.470
 and then you can use it in the driveway 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.690
 of the best function of this car 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.690
 the launch control what should you do 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.390
 sp must have sports mode 5 CDs to s 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.390
 panel on it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.420
 and thank you for mac he threw a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.110
 day to on board 3 point 8 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.110
 that is really bizarre 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.880
 yes what a fantastic car this is 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.310
 And I mean really this specific 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.370
 copy because if you see it as 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.319
 you were going to shove it out 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.450
 respect that he looks so tasty 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.060
 Sleek out when you see the curves 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.239
 purchase a black-colored artevelde 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.190
 nice roofline perfect where does this stand 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.190
 co well that would be all my sense bands and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.720
 her little tom and he says rested 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.669
 all tasty options you want 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.620
 have the passage seats that also really 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.200
 those are the best massage seats that they have 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.110
 its better because some jack eye bmf audi 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.410
 what else do you have seat ventilation 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.960
 seat heating 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.550
 seat heater behind uncle tom 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.750
 sound system 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.750
 there really feel necessary so 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.060
 yeah i can't stop your blood 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.030
 just have a formatting 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.979
 you can therefore use many more 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.500
 you can use the power much better 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.690
 because if you were to chip this thing 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.240
 what would happen then we will 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.949
 invent soon because we are about to 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.639
 a few weeks with the chip tuning 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:07.060
 longest so a chip 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.419
 cls 63 amg 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.419
