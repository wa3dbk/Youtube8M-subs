out of the car

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.940 
out of the car
in<00:01:20.450> fact<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.080> touring<00:01:21.470> model<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.830> we're

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
in fact this touring model that we're

driving it's about 23

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.750 
driving it's about 23
that's<00:01:24.380> super<00:01:24.770> lightweight<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.369> these<00:01:25.520> days

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
that's super lightweight in these days

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.400 
that's super lightweight in these days
and<00:01:26.210> what<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.479> does<00:01:26.660> is<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:26.960> makes<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.229> car

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
quicker and also helps when it comes to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.840 
quicker and also helps when it comes to
fuel<00:01:29.450> economy<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:30.229> fact<00:01:30.500> we<00:01:30.740> expect<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:31.130> mid<00:01:31.430> 30
