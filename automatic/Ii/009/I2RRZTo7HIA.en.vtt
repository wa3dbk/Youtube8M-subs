00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.170
 I follow this event since 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.010
 first edition then this is the third 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.750
 edition I have always participated 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.869
 if I'm still here because I believe in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 this event the speech 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 online music instrument we say that there 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 we are almost by chance met with 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 thomas from an initial exchange of ideas e 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.950
 then we were immediately in tune and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 this is where this has grown 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.910
 collaboration with an online tool 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 professional collaboration is one 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.850
 friendly cooperation we say with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 music of and the community of months what is there 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.719
 you can say maybe something about the products and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 on the new product that is presented today 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.210
 here we produce we say everything turns 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 around the fact that we have 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.570
 studied new circuits 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.590
 unpublished using transistors but 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.110
 designing in mode let's say 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.440
 then take out a sound 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.000
 this tube is based a little bit all 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.130
 our production 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 so much so that also on the homepage of the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 our site we say that valves are 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 obsolete i really believe in this thing e 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.950
 there is no I do not say that they are no longer needed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 angular is not this the speech is not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.010
 but you don't know how much to throw them away 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.619
 today it makes more sense to continue 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.990
 design valves for me here for the lo 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.100
 less for me for my later experience 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.840
 the super clean 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 the super overdrive we have completed a 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 what the range of sounds is not 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.970
 let's say with the super overdrive 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.970
 we have all the blues fusion sounds 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.049
 precisely the overdrive sounds with the clean 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.300
 we have the classic American sound 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.550
 clean e 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.610
 it lacked the british and therefore we have 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.130
 made the super british which is the sound the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.990
 English crunch 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.080
 the history of rock that the history of 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.510
 rock hard rock 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 by jimi hendrix what you want me to tell you 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.980
 jimmy page 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.140
 it's just what we say a little while ago 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.240
 around the music of mi community 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.490
 is enjoying this thing is coming 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.720
 out a beautiful friendship a nice relationship 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.940
 and I have every intention of carrying it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 forward and deepen it even more 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.880
 this relationship of friendship with the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.880
 music of community
