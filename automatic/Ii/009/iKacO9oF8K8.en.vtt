00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.149
 what is just the wonder 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.180
 the wonder of being immersed in a 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.690
 romantic forest at the beginning of climbing 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.210
 this long avenue brings pia up and then 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.110
 to arrive in front of the villa and to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.150
 find yourself almost suddenly on the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.800
 Italian garden terrace that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.699
 opens onto the splendid Gulf of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.510
 tigullio 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.329
 my garden is kept at bay 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.110
 guardians the quartians are rocks 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.470
 that we found there doing the excavations 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.030
 and then the traveler is sent to us 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.640
 we who make this journey 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.119
 symbolized in a fountain that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.790
 colorful green and yellow lemon yellow 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.220
 because the harshness of the journey and green 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.580
 because it is hoped that this trip goes 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 well 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 in our garden there are the pergolas e 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.820
 all terraces are connected by 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.119
 pergolas in chestnut and bamboo covered with 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.610
 wisteria covered with rose bank covered 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.369
 I really like the bougainvillea 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.340
 therefore our Mediterranean area 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.590
 of the gardens of the sun and the smells of the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.580
 different sage rosemary 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.430
 spices and those are perhaps the essences 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.200
 which I also associate with the garden 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.830
 for example odors lavender 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:02.360
 Mediterranean in that word he has 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.979
 written s closes the garden and for whom 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.770
 he comes to visit her for those who do not know him 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.280
 completely totally a surprise 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.860
 unexpected because everything develops 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.670
 behind a facade of this building 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.830
 eighteenth century that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.170
 it doesn't show anything in mine 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.080
 garden there is a lot of water there are stadiums 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.590
 there are chat rivers and there are ponds 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.860
 because water is life for me 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.770
 we are made of water and therefore we say 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.520
 creates a lot of energy around this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.630
 garden came to mind space for the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.380
 possibility of having prospects 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.860
 completely different certain point you 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.580
 check a minaret so you're in the east 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.870
 or there is the esoteric zone the part 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.620
 where the statue is the sarcophagus 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 we have recovered a beautiful curious 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.260
 building an old ice house a 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.840
 small circular building of which the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.459
 part above ground from 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.350
 archive we discovered that in the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.090
 seven hundred was called la casina del 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.340
 coffee evidently tris grandparents great-grandparents 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.950
 they didn't use to have coffee and go there 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.540
 maybe even the chocolate they were 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.730
 greedy what we found 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.040
 traces in this archive 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.520
 hernesto save 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.160
 just like secret garden respect 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:41.460
 to an aggression both of the noises of the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.600
 city ​​traffic is 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.930
 building speculation that has it 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.540
 surrounded and despite all this 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.130
 continues to offer peace and peace 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.060
 joy in a totally way 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:59.770
 unexpected with his quiet with his 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.470
 peace with its gentle sounds I would look for 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.770
 to enjoy feeling the sun on 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.890
 skin to transpose then give a little 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.490
 time in the garden to love us 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.590
 with all its beauties the perfumes la 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.470
 people who work there the little dog who 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.320
 escapes that is a child that was a day 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.670
 to pretend it's our garden that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.670
 if the garden of our company 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.500
 no
