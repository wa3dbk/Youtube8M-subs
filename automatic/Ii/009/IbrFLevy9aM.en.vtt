honey I see this fuses behind us
I<00:00:42.500> see<00:00:43.070> seahorses<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.699> are<00:00:43.940> very<00:00:44.180> very<00:00:44.420> small

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
I see seahorses that are very very small

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.680 
I see seahorses that are very very small
all<00:00:45.409> the<00:00:45.469> way<00:00:45.589> up<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.949> decent<00:00:46.309> sized<00:00:46.690> seahorses

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
all the way up to decent sized seahorses

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.360 
all the way up to decent sized seahorses
that<00:00:47.719> we<00:00:47.899> might<00:00:48.079> see<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.350> our<00:00:48.469> displays<00:00:48.829> so

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
that we might see in our displays so

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.430 
that we might see in our displays so
tell<00:00:49.699> me<00:00:49.850> what<00:00:50.000> we<00:00:50.120> have<00:00:50.269> here<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.989> littlest

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
tell me what we have here the littlest

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.319 
tell me what we have here the littlest
guys<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:51.949> I<00:00:51.980> see<00:00:52.250> these<00:00:52.850> guys<00:00:53.059> are

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
guys that I see these guys are

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.509 
guys that I see these guys are
hippocampus<00:00:53.960> erectus<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.739> they<00:00:55.129> were<00:00:55.190> born

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
hippocampus erectus and they were born

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.930 
hippocampus erectus and they were born
about<00:00:55.699> 15<00:00:56.120> days<00:00:56.360> ago<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.289> they<00:00:57.860> are<00:00:58.070> we<00:00:58.760> have

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
about 15 days ago so they are we have

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.819 
about 15 days ago so they are we have
them<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.149> very<00:00:59.390> small<00:00:59.809> pseudo<00:01:00.170> kreizel<00:01:00.440> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
them in a very small pseudo kreizel and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.490 
them in a very small pseudo kreizel and
they<00:01:01.399> cannot<00:01:01.789> wear<00:01:02.239> they<00:01:02.360> can<00:01:02.510> swim<00:01:03.170> freely

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
they cannot wear they can swim freely

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.690 
they cannot wear they can swim freely
and<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.699> get<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.509> proper<00:01:05.840> nutrition<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:10.520> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
and and get the proper nutrition so the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.700 
and and get the proper nutrition so the
seahorses<00:01:11.240> can't<00:01:11.750> get<00:01:11.899> stuck<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.319> corner

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
seahorses can't get stuck that corner

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.399 
seahorses can't get stuck that corner
and<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.429> flow<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:13.940> very<00:01:14.119> low<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:14.990> they<00:01:15.229> don't

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
and the flow is very low so they don't

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.510 
and the flow is very low so they don't
get<00:01:15.590> caught<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:17.800> yeah<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.979> flow<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.490> flow

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
get caught up yeah the flow the flow

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.120 
get caught up yeah the flow the flow
helps<00:01:20.060> them<00:01:20.270> move<00:01:20.960> around<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.380> tank<00:01:21.649> they<00:01:21.950> can

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
helps them move around the tank they can

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.520 
helps them move around the tank they can
they<00:01:22.460> can<00:01:22.640> hold<00:01:22.880> on<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.330> holdfast<00:01:23.780> which<00:01:24.380> of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
they can hold on to a holdfast which of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.190 
they can hold on to a holdfast which of
the<00:01:24.590> hold<00:01:24.770> fast<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:25.310> our<00:01:25.600> piece<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.780> a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the hold fast is just our piece of a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.070 
the hold fast is just our piece of a
fern<00:01:27.830> here<00:01:28.130> basically<00:01:28.759> or<00:01:29.149> plant<00:01:29.509> material

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
fern here basically or plant material

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.309 
fern here basically or plant material
and<00:01:30.280> they<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:31.429> hold<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.789> there<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.299> if<00:01:33.020> they

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
and they can hold on there but if they

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.350 
and they can hold on there but if they
had<00:01:33.500> let<00:01:33.710> go<00:01:33.860> of<00:01:34.009> their<00:01:34.130> hold<00:01:34.340> fast<00:01:34.580> they<00:01:35.149> can

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
had let go of their hold fast they can

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
had let go of their hold fast they can
just<00:01:35.539> rotate<00:01:35.990> around<00:01:36.319> the<00:01:36.590> tank<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.280> very

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
just rotate around the tank in a very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.580 
just rotate around the tank in a very
free<00:01:37.909> manner<00:01:38.209> and<00:01:38.630> not<00:01:38.869> get<00:01:39.080> stuck<00:01:39.319> in<00:01:39.470> any

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
free manner and not get stuck in any

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.240 
free manner and not get stuck in any
corner<00:01:43.450> okay<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.509> from<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.500> little<00:01:45.799> guys<00:01:46.009> that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
corner okay so from the little guys that

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.310 
corner okay so from the little guys that
are<00:01:46.310> only<00:01:46.430> 15<00:01:46.909> days<00:01:46.939> old<00:01:47.420> what's<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.110> next

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
are only 15 days old what's the next

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.010 
are only 15 days old what's the next
stage<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.920> seahorses<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.939> have<00:01:50.119> well<00:01:50.899> as

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
stage of seahorses that you have well as

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.300 
stage of seahorses that you have well as
they<00:01:51.200> get<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.380> little<00:01:51.619> bit<00:01:51.710> bigger<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.189> they

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
they get a little bit bigger and they

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.709 
they get a little bit bigger and they
can<00:01:52.460> maneuver<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.939> little<00:01:53.149> bit<00:01:53.240> better<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.630> a

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
can maneuver a little bit better in a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.170 
can maneuver a little bit better in a
crys<00:01:54.020> L<00:01:54.259> which<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.680> kreizel<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.609> larger

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
crys L which a kreizel is just a larger

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.870 
crys L which a kreizel is just a larger
a<00:01:56.390> larger<00:01:57.310> pseudo<00:01:58.310> kreizel

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a larger pseudo kreizel

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.929 
a larger pseudo kreizel
so<00:01:59.359> as<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.170> span<00:02:00.439> gets<00:02:00.710> larger<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.700> turns

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
so as the span gets larger here it turns

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.660 
so as the span gets larger here it turns
into<00:02:02.149> more<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.600> kreizel<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:03.950> these<00:02:04.460> guys

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
into more of a kreizel so as these guys

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.190 
into more of a kreizel so as these guys
get<00:02:04.939> a<00:02:04.969> little<00:02:05.060> bit<00:02:05.240> bigger<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:05.899> they<00:02:06.020> can

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
get a little bit bigger and they can

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
get a little bit bigger and they can
adjust<00:02:06.679> swim<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.700> theirs<00:02:07.880> better<00:02:08.149> swim

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
adjust swim have theirs better swim

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.140 
adjust swim have theirs better swim
behaviors<00:02:09.079> will<00:02:09.649> move<00:02:09.829> them<00:02:09.979> up<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.459> larger

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
behaviors will move them up to a larger

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.130 
behaviors will move them up to a larger
a<00:02:11.180> larger<00:02:11.540> system

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.229 

yeah<00:02:18.140> these<00:02:18.470> guys<00:02:18.739> they've<00:02:19.640> developed<00:02:19.970> a

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
yeah these guys they've developed a

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.729 
yeah these guys they've developed a
little<00:02:20.359> bit<00:02:20.540> more<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.049> have<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> little

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
little bit more so they have a little

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.670 
little bit more so they have a little
bit<00:02:21.920> easier<00:02:22.820> time<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.299> swim<00:02:23.510> around<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.500> as

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
bit easier time to swim around so as

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.229 
bit easier time to swim around so as
they<00:02:24.859> get<00:02:25.040> as<00:02:25.190> they<00:02:25.489> get<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.820> bit<00:02:26.030> larger

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
they get as they get a little bit larger

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.599 
they get as they get a little bit larger
and<00:02:26.690> probably<00:02:26.989> about<00:02:27.079> 20<00:02:27.530> 25<00:02:27.829> days<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.430> can

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
and probably about 20 25 days we can

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.370 
and probably about 20 25 days we can
actually<00:02:28.880> move<00:02:29.030> them<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> larger<00:02:29.870> aquarium

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
actually move them to a larger aquarium

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.510 
actually move them to a larger aquarium
so<00:02:30.769> how<00:02:30.980> many<00:02:31.040> sea<00:02:31.609> horses

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
so how many sea horses

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.100 
so how many sea horses
ah<00:02:32.580> regretted<00:02:33.300> them<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
ah regretted them one time as you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.160 
ah regretted them one time as you
consider<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.830> what<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.100> call<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:36.170> well

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
consider and what do you call that well

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.020 
consider and what do you call that well
these<00:02:37.320> these<00:02:37.590> seahorses<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:38.430> hippocampus

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
these these seahorses are hippocampus

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.760 
these these seahorses are hippocampus
erectus<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.440> anywhere

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
erectus and they can have anywhere

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.340 
erectus and they can have anywhere
between<00:02:40.830> two<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.490> three<00:02:41.550> hundred<00:02:41.990> broodstock

about<00:02:49.890> fifty<00:02:50.430> days<00:02:52.160> because<00:02:53.160> they<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.460> such<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
about fifty days because they are such a

small animal the brood stock as you see

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610 
small animal the brood stock as you see
here<00:02:56.580> they<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.750> caught<00:02:57.990> up<00:02:58.140> very<00:02:58.410> well<00:02:58.470> in

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
here they can get caught up very well in

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
here they can get caught up very well in
the<00:02:58.890> filtration<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.730> we're<00:03:00.660> absolutely

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the filtration and we're absolutely

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.070 
the filtration and we're absolutely
trying<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> perfect<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.090> does<00:03:03.300> they

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
trying to perfect it but it does they

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.950 
trying to perfect it but it does they
can<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.440> caught<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.860> they<00:03:05.660> there<00:03:06.660> might<00:03:06.930> be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
can get caught up they there might be

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.050 
can get caught up they there might be
issues<00:03:07.320> with<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.830> nutritional<00:03:08.310> diets<00:03:08.730> they

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
issues with the nutritional diets they

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.030 
issues with the nutritional diets they
might<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.570> eating<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.960> whole<00:03:10.110> time<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.590> we

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
might not be eating the whole time so we

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
might not be eating the whole time so we
do<00:03:11.220> lose<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.520> percentage<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.480> seahorses<00:03:13.230> over

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
do lose a percentage of seahorses over

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:24.170 
do lose a percentage of seahorses over
time<00:03:21.800> well<00:03:22.800> an<00:03:22.920> adult<00:03:23.280> seahorse<00:03:23.790> would<00:03:24.030> be

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
time well an adult seahorse would be

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.200 
time well an adult seahorse would be
reach<00:03:24.390> maturity<00:03:25.190> but<00:03:26.190> their<00:03:26.430> maturity<00:03:26.970> would

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
reach maturity but their maturity would

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.130 
reach maturity but their maturity would
take<00:03:27.480> anywhere<00:03:28.290> between<00:03:29.510> six<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.720> seven

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
take anywhere between six to seven

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.110 
take anywhere between six to seven
months<00:03:31.320> where<00:03:32.070> they<00:03:32.250> could<00:03:32.430> actually<00:03:32.580> get<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
months where they could actually get to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.840 
months where they could actually get to
a<00:03:33.660> medium<00:03:34.470> range<00:03:34.650> which<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.340> which

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
a medium range which would be which

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.570 
a medium range which would be which
would<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.180> these<00:03:36.360> guys<00:03:36.570> would<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.840> sub<00:03:37.200> adult

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
would be these guys would be sub adult

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.580 
would be these guys would be sub adult
seahorses<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:39.990> mature<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.380> little

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
seahorses and as they mature a little

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.130 
seahorses and as they mature a little
bit<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.130> would<00:03:41.580> say<00:03:41.790> another<00:03:42.180> thirty<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.810> forty

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
bit I would say another thirty to forty

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.050 
bit I would say another thirty to forty
days<00:03:43.350> they<00:03:44.040> would<00:03:44.220> start<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.520> reach<00:03:44.760> sexual

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
days they would start to reach sexual

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930 
days they would start to reach sexual
maturity

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.150 

yeah<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.780> can<00:03:49.930> see<00:03:50.110> here<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.440> this<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:50.980> just

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
guys can be displayed as long as the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.699 
guys can be displayed as long as the
flows<00:03:56.200> are<00:03:56.230> proper<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:58.230> they<00:03:59.230> have<00:03:59.350> even

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
seahorses seahorses are very they don't

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.009 
seahorses seahorses are very they don't
like<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:14.980> bugged<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.570> can't<00:04:16.840> really

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
have a lot of fishing with seahorses so

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.330 
have a lot of fishing with seahorses so
you<00:04:19.810> really<00:04:20.109> want<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.410> concentrate<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:20.919> on

tinea to live brine and Cyclopes and
some<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.860> these<00:04:32.950> things<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.400> frozen<00:04:33.700> my

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
some of these things can be frozen my

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.900 
some of these things can be frozen my
acid's<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.160> have<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.340> feed<00:04:36.700> them

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
acid's but you really have to feed them

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
acid's but you really have to feed them
a<00:04:36.940> couple<00:04:37.330> times<00:04:37.450> several<00:04:38.050> times<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.500> day

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
a couple times several times a day

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.230 
a couple times several times a day
because<00:04:39.250> these<00:04:39.610> animals<00:04:39.820> don't<00:04:40.120> have

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
because these animals don't have

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.330 
because these animals don't have
stomachs<00:04:40.780> they<00:04:41.020> really<00:04:41.350> want<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.680> they<00:04:42.010> it's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
stomachs they really want to they it's

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.880 
stomachs they really want to they it's
they're<00:04:42.790> just<00:04:43.479> station<00:04:43.840> cycle<00:04:44.350> or<00:04:44.590> they're

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
they're just station cycle or they're

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.590 
they're just station cycle or they're
their<00:04:45.850> gut<00:04:46.690> transit<00:04:47.260> time<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.970> very<00:04:48.970> very

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
their gut transit time is very very

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.840 
their gut transit time is very very
minimal<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.229> they<00:04:50.710> they<00:04:51.040> produce<00:04:51.280> they

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
minimal so they they produce they

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.450 
minimal so they they produce they
produce<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.300> rather<00:04:52.570> quickly<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.830> no<00:04:53.860> stomach

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
produce it rather quickly so no stomach

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.620 
produce it rather quickly so no stomach
stuff<00:04:54.700> no<00:04:55.210> stomachs<00:04:55.690> on<00:04:55.810> these<00:04:55.960> guys<00:04:57.630> these

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
stuff no stomachs on these guys these

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.530 
stuff no stomachs on these guys these
guys<00:04:58.690> are<00:04:58.960> eating<00:04:59.380> our<00:05:00.100> t<00:05:00.430> mia<00:05:00.669> which<00:05:01.330> are

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
guys are eating our t mia which are

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.330 
guys are eating our t mia which are
basically<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.680> hatch<00:05:03.190> brine<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:04.110> but<00:05:05.110> very

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
new trim do we have any here we actually

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.440 
new trim do we have any here we actually
do<00:05:13.930> this<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.440> uh<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.340> right<00:05:15.789> now<00:05:15.970> this<00:05:16.240> is

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
do this is uh this is right now this is

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.409 
do this is uh this is right now this is
the<00:05:16.630> arty<00:05:17.050> MIA<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.940> beginning

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
the arty MIA and this is the beginning

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.969 
the arty MIA and this is the beginning
stages<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:20.130> hatch<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.430> brine<00:05:21.700> so<00:05:22.390> it's<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.770> very

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
stages of hatch to brine so it's a very

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.810 
stages of hatch to brine so it's a very
microscopic<00:05:25.169> material<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:27.340> that's<00:05:27.610> what

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
microscopic material and and that's what

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.480 
microscopic material and and that's what
we're<00:05:28.240> feeding<00:05:28.630> these<00:05:28.750> guys<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.470> what<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.010> this

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
we're feeding these guys so what so this

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.100 
we're feeding these guys so what so this
must<00:05:30.760> be<00:05:30.820> hatched<00:05:31.060> bright<00:05:31.330> as<00:05:31.450> well<00:05:31.600> right

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
must be hatched bright as well right

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.600 
must be hatched bright as well right
that's<00:05:32.410> hatched<00:05:32.680> Ryan<00:05:33.010> but<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.340> is<00:05:33.520> the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
that's hatched Ryan but this is the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.520 
that's hatched Ryan but this is the
adult<00:05:33.910> stage<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.450> hatch<00:05:34.600> Brian<00:05:34.930> that's<00:05:35.260> pretty

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
adult stage of hatch Brian that's pretty

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.560 
adult stage of hatch Brian that's pretty
cool<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.830> can<00:05:35.979> see<00:05:36.520> them<00:05:36.640> more<00:05:37.090> presently

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
cool so you can see them more presently

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.180 
cool so you can see them more presently
swimming<00:05:37.960> around<00:05:38.110> yeah<00:05:38.560> now<00:05:38.770> these<00:05:38.919> guys

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
swimming around yeah now these guys

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.330 
swimming around yeah now these guys
would<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.610> too<00:05:39.820> big<00:05:40.260> for<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.620> juvenile

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
would be too big for the juvenile

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.490 
would be too big for the juvenile
seahorses

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.920 

great<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.400> learn<00:05:46.550> more<00:05:46.700> about<00:05:46.760> seahorses<00:05:47.090> and

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
great to learn more about seahorses and

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.290
