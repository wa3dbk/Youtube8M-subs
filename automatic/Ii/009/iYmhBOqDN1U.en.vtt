it's<00:02:45.060> not<00:02:45.239> like<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.440> damage

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
it's not like that and a bit of damage

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.160 
it's not like that and a bit of damage
done<00:02:47.040> games<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:50.599> think<00:02:51.599> most<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.049> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
done games do and I think most of you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.890 
done games do and I think most of you
probably<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:53.129> what<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.579> DPS<00:02:54.239> tank<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
probably know what the DPS tank and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.569 
probably know what the DPS tank and
healer<00:02:55.620> are<00:02:55.889> for<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.639> group<00:02:56.909> but<00:02:57.510> uh<00:02:58.579> I'll

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
healer are for a group but uh I'll

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.580 
healer are for a group but uh I'll
probably<00:02:59.760> explain<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.269> later<00:03:00.359> because<00:03:01.260> it's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
probably explain it later because it's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.610 
probably explain it later because it's
kind<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.250> hard<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> explain<00:03:02.609> it<00:03:02.940> yes<00:03:03.620> but

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
kind of hard to explain it yes but

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
kind of hard to explain it yes but
paladin's<00:03:05.190> they<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.519> they<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:05.849> perform

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
paladin's they can they can perform

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
group just like a druid or shaman maybe

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.379 
group just like a druid or shaman maybe
and<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.829> that's<00:03:14.040> really<00:03:14.250> cool<00:03:14.400> that's

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
and that that's really cool that's

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.569 
and that that's really cool that's
pretty<00:03:15.540> awesome<00:03:15.659> you<00:03:16.379> should<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.159> so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
pretty awesome you should be like so

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.909 
pretty awesome you should be like so
much<00:03:18.060> easier<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.599> find<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.870> group<00:03:19.019> with<00:03:19.650> that

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
much easier to find a group with that

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:26.089 
much easier to find a group with that
cannot<00:03:20.220> couch<00:03:23.959> know<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.079> class<00:03:25.290> every<00:03:26.069> I

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
cannot couch know the class every I

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.770 
cannot couch know the class every I
thought<00:03:26.430> every<00:03:26.849> class<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.480> ups<00:03:27.660> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
thought every class has some ups and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.740 
thought every class has some ups and
downs<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.169> guess<00:03:28.970> think<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.150> only<00:03:30.299> ups<00:03:30.569> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
downs I guess think the only ups and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:42.240 
downs I guess think the only ups and
downs<00:03:30.870> I've<00:03:31.049> ever<00:03:31.199> seen<00:03:31.410> Rosa

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.630 

they<00:03:42.790> don't<00:03:42.940> have<00:03:43.060> any<00:03:43.240> range<00:03:43.480> abilities

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
they don't have any range abilities

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.220 
they don't have any range abilities
that's<00:03:45.640> why<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.820> like<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.390> would<00:03:46.780> have<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.080> get

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
that's why I like you would have to get

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.290 
that's why I like you would have to get
a<00:03:47.260> gun<00:03:47.470> or<00:03:47.770> bow<00:03:48.370> something<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.970> pull<00:03:49.150> people

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
a gun or bow something to pull people

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.730 
a gun or bow something to pull people
instead<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:51.120> hitting<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.540> Holy<00:03:53.320> attack

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
instead of just hitting the Holy attack

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.320 
instead of just hitting the Holy attack
or<00:03:53.950> something<00:03:54.160> or<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.880> could<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.150> your

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
or something or you could if your

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.080 
or something or you could if your
protection<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.080> had<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.790> avenger<00:03:57.790> shield

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
protection and you had a avenger shield

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.960 
protection and you had a avenger shield
but<00:03:58.420> that's<00:03:58.780> different<00:03:59.700> everything<00:04:00.700> else<00:04:00.820> you

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
but that's different everything else you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.080 
but that's different everything else you
have<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:02.040> either<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.340> rush<00:04:03.580> in<00:04:03.730> there<00:04:03.880> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
have to either just rush in there and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.050 
have to either just rush in there and
pull<00:04:04.240> like<00:04:04.420> five<00:04:04.630> knobs<00:04:05.020> or<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:06.060> you'll

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
pull like five knobs or just you'll

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.160 
pull like five knobs or just you'll
shoot<00:04:07.330> again<00:04:07.600> pull<00:04:08.020> one<00:04:08.320> mob<00:04:08.530> at<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.770> time<00:04:08.950> I

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
shoot again pull one mob at the time I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.960 
shoot again pull one mob at the time I
suppose<00:04:11.170> that's<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.470> only<00:04:11.709> downfall<00:04:11.890> but<00:04:12.850> you

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
suppose that's the only downfall but you

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.800 
suppose that's the only downfall but you
