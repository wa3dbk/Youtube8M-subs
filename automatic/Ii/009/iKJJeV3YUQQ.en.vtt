00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.719
 hello everyone today I'm going to make you 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.539
 fillets chicken roy stack the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.820
 ingredients that we need are steaks 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.539
 of chicken or if you prefer you can do it 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.779
 also with bread crumbs a couple 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.730
 of eggs a bechamel bay leaf 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.109
 that I already have prepared that does not have to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.429
 be my company but not very 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:34.270
 liquid you see this is the salt thickness 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.270
 oil and a little water 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 know our steaks for this I have 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.190
 put the water in a saucepan 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.190
 in fact salt 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.920
 I put the bay leaf 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.230
 and me all the steaks 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.380
 and now we're going to let it cook as they are 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 steaks with five minutes cooking is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 enough if they were breasts that you know 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.930
 that are fatter you will have to have them 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.930
 about 12 minutes cooking 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.770
 once they are cooked 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 we take them to a plate 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 and we have to wait for them to cool 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.930
 to continue with the next step 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.880
 we have the cold steaks and now what 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.780
 let's do is put them 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780
 in the bechamel 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.430
 so that they cover themselves well 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.410
 to a layer 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.610
 and we deposit it 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.910
 in a tray to cool 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 and the bechamel is cold you see in the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.180
 stain we have to pass it through egg bread 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.670
 grated and fry them look at a trick to 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.280
 Do not expect anything from your fingers 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.520
 you catch, I do not know, you have me a little 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.520
 Water 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.600
 so you can work it 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.600
 much easier 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.849
 with the egg 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.969
 the screens 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.720
 here it is necessary to light it lengthens not us 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.720
 there is another 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.770
 duckies then breadcrumbs 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.920
 Y 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.920
 a pan with plenty of oil 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.920
 to fry 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.250
 good that we already have our list 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.170
 steaks the eagle roy I like 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.310
 accompany him with a little pisto or 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.709
 natural tomato as you prefer 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.450
 this recipe has another option if you want 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.730
 Freeze it once you have it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.519
 passed through the egg and breadcrumbs what 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.470
 you put in a tupper we cover it well and what 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.690
 you put in the freezer and it's great 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.209
