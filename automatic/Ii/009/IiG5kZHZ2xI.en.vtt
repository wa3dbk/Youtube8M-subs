00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
solid go around the weight difference is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.310 
solid go around the weight difference is
just<00:03:20.740> being<00:03:21.370> enormous<00:03:22.120> but<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.020> can<00:03:23.170> tell

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
just being enormous but you can tell

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.110 
just being enormous but you can tell
they're<00:03:23.470> featherweight<00:03:23.950> at<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:24.280> point<00:03:24.610> you

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
they're featherweight at this point you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.570 
they're featherweight at this point you
can<00:03:25.240> actually<00:03:25.570> hear<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.200> seeds<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.830> them<00:03:27.010> at

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
can actually hear the seeds on them at

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.190 
can actually hear the seeds on them at
this<00:03:27.790> point<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.210> can<00:03:28.360> simply<00:03:28.720> pill<00:03:28.960> and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
this point you can simply pill and

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.020 
this point you can simply pill and
