00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
the book it ended up being nothing like

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.899 
the book it ended up being nothing like
what<00:00:47.019> I<00:00:47.140> thought<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.949> may<00:00:48.159> have<00:00:48.190> been<00:00:48.640> very

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
what I thought it may have been very

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.820 
what I thought it may have been very
different<00:00:49.210> from<00:00:49.659> anything<00:00:50.050> else<00:00:50.260> I've<00:00:50.500> read

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
different from anything else I've read

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.820 
different from anything else I've read
from<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.129> time<00:00:51.550> period<00:00:51.580> um<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:53.350> think<00:00:53.710> it's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
from that time period um I think it's

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.890 
from that time period um I think it's
considered<00:00:54.250> one<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.790> earliest<00:00:55.239> feminist

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
considered one of the earliest feminist

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.320 
considered one of the earliest feminist
novels<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.739> can<00:00:56.979> see<00:00:57.190> why<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.790> won't<00:00:58.150> go<00:00:58.300> into

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
novels and I can see why I won't go into

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.810 
novels and I can see why I won't go into
too<00:00:58.510> much<00:00:58.629> detail<00:00:58.780> but<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.739> do<00:00:59.860> recommend<00:01:00.519> it

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
too much detail but I do recommend it

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.210 
too much detail but I do recommend it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.399 
it didn't ruin the rest of it for me but
it's<00:02:58.799> not<00:02:58.889> what<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.489> would<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.849> hoped<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.750> guess
