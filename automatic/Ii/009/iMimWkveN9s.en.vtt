let<00:02:18.380> me<00:02:18.560> explain<00:02:18.920> about<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.610> site<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.430> bamboo

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
let me explain about the site the bamboo

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.090 
let me explain about the site the bamboo
stick<00:02:23.360> shows<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.520> angle<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.300> line<00:02:27.100> then

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
stick shows the angle of the line then

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.010 
stick shows the angle of the line then
both<00:02:29.000> arms<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:32.210> chains<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:35.020> chain

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
both arms have the chains so chain

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.660 
both arms have the chains so chain

horizontal membranes to assemble them
vertical<00:04:04.340> ones<00:04:04.580> would<00:04:05.030> have<00:04:05.230> one<00:04:06.230> sided<00:04:08.230> cut

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
vertical ones would have one sided cut

half cut other horizontal ones they

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.250 
half cut other horizontal ones they
would<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:20.090> cut<00:04:20.450> from<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.200> bottom<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:23.260> if

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
would have a cut from the bottom so if

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.620 
would have a cut from the bottom so if
they<00:04:24.590> are

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
they are

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.300 
they are
fit<00:04:26.380> sit<00:04:27.340> together<00:04:28.470> therefore<00:04:29.470> surface<00:04:30.070> you

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
fit sit together therefore surface you

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
fit sit together therefore surface you
will<00:04:30.430> find<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:31.450> parabolic<00:04:33.030> curve<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
will find the parabolic curve the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.810 
will find the parabolic curve the
surface<00:04:38.550> now<00:04:39.550> we<00:04:40.270> have<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.660> grew<00:04:41.820> reflector

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
surface now we have to grew reflector

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.800 
surface now we have to grew reflector
but<00:04:44.010> we<00:04:45.010> have<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.340> cut<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:48.210> for<00:04:49.210> each<00:04:49.450> section

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
but we have to cut it for each section

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.690 
but we have to cut it for each section
because<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.280> different<00:04:51.880> each<00:04:52.390> other<00:04:53.700> and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
because it is different each other and

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.400 
because it is different each other and
because<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.390> we<00:04:55.870> use<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.380> light<00:04:56.760> membrane<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
because of we use the light membrane the

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.900 
because of we use the light membrane the
space<00:05:00.310> for<00:05:00.670> glue<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:02.460> reflecting<00:05:04.170> sheet<00:05:05.910> is

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
space for glue the reflecting sheet is

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.740 
space for glue the reflecting sheet is
not<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.810> wide<00:05:08.200> enough<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:11.310> actually<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.750> hero

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
not that wide enough so actually a hero

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.830 
not that wide enough so actually a hero
will<00:05:14.080> still<00:05:14.500> call<00:05:14.740> him<00:05:14.940> he<00:05:15.940> put<00:05:16.240> this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
will still call him he put this

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:25.710 
will still call him he put this
cardboard<00:05:19.920> on<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.580> membrane<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:24.480> he<00:05:25.480> got

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
cardboard on the membrane so he got

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.930 
cardboard on the membrane so he got
wider<00:05:27.060> here<00:05:28.060> we<00:05:28.240> had<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.600> be<00:05:29.230> glued<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:32.950> bit

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
wider here we had to be glued a bit

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.200 
wider here we had to be glued a bit
patient<00:05:34.750> work<00:05:35.260> quite<00:05:36.160> a<00:05:36.190> number<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:38.040> sections

to<00:05:40.210> be<00:05:40.450> good<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.940> let<00:05:46.180> me<00:05:46.420> repeat<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:46.900> then

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
to be good so let me repeat it then

improvements necessary to here for the
solar<00:07:10.950> cooker<00:07:17.510> now<00:07:18.510> this<00:07:19.170> is<00:07:19.350> a<00:07:21.470> very<00:07:22.470> bad<00:07:22.680> the

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
solar cooker now this is a very bad the

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.420 
solar cooker now this is a very bad the
choice<00:07:23.100> of<00:07:23.490> material<00:07:24.180> if<00:07:24.480> the<00:07:25.170> focus<00:07:25.680> thing

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
choice of material if the focus thing

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.560 
choice of material if the focus thing
was<00:07:26.700> a<00:07:26.730> mist<00:07:27.120> then<00:07:28.020> the<00:07:28.860> wood<00:07:29.130> started<00:07:30.060> to<00:07:30.270> burn

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
was a mist then the wood started to burn

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.980 
was a mist then the wood started to burn
but<00:07:31.410> it<00:07:31.620> says<00:07:31.980> shows<00:07:32.400> the<00:07:33.060> temperature<00:07:33.690> is<00:07:33.750> so

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
but it says shows the temperature is so

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.780 
but it says shows the temperature is so
high<00:07:34.940> we<00:07:35.940> have<00:07:35.970> to<00:07:36.180> change<00:07:36.630> it<00:07:36.930> and<00:07:37.200> if<00:07:38.190> we

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790 
high we have to change it and if we

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.880 
high we have to change it and if we
change<00:07:39.150> it<00:07:39.800> with<00:07:40.800> all<00:07:41.280> the<00:07:41.670> burnt<00:07:42.590> membrane<00:07:43.590> of

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
change it with all the burnt membrane of

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.010 
change it with all the burnt membrane of
wood<00:07:44.330> then<00:07:45.330> we<00:07:45.780> get<00:07:45.990> more<00:07:46.680> heat
