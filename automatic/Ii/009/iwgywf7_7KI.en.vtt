00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:10.256
I've built an APRS transmitter into my car,

00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:15.042
which means you can see my car's position on a Google Maps interface.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.759
It's here in the trunk.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:18.405
This is the whole stuff,

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:22.930
The transmitter is here.

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:26.005
It receives the coordinates from the GPS system and then retransmits them on radio

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.950
which are received and posted to the internet by the amateur radio APRS system.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.429
Here are the two antennas needed for APRS:

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.467
the GPS and the VHF antenna.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:48.902
This is the TinyTrak which encodes the coordinates.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:52.846
This is the GPS module.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:58.763
This is the GPS module.

00:00:50.874 --> 00:01:00.735
And this is the relay for the power. If there's 
 ignition the TinyTrak transmits the position every 15 seconds,

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:12.567
and if I turn off the ignition it transmits position every 30 secs 
 for additional 2 minutes with a different icon on the map.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:18.484
The transmitter is there, bolted into the carpet.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:24.400
It's a Grundig FK105 with 14 watts output.

00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:31.317
Now we're connected to the TinyTrak using the serial port.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:36.233
And here's the setup,

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:44.120
this is an old laptop without display which has a 
 normal serial port so I can program the TinyTrak.

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:50.040
The other laptop is here for the internet, 
 because the old one doesn't have wifi.

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:55.950
I need to turn on the ignition because the TinyTrak has no power.

00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:03.840
You can hear the APRS beacons on the radio.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.790
And now the TinyTrak can be configured using this software.
