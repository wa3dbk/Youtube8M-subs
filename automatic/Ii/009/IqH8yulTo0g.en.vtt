00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.189
 that's what winners look like yesterday evening it was in the pcc stadium for the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.070
 Spectators again a fun evening and for the guests there was again 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.249
 did not seem to pick 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.170
 but at first the acts did make this goal difficult for HSV to play 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 with then but the hoped for leadership by Linda Bresonik after a double pass with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.220
 Alexander Popp 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 1 0 for the FCB from 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.890
 in the 28th minute it was again Alexander Popp Stipe Sonneck served the second 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.130
 Goal of the national team the Finns on the go to the next round 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.140
 The most controversial scene in the game was followed by the HSV gate 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.130
 wear through yes Vreden was not because of an alleged offside position 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.220
 accepted 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 the reclamation of Aferdita Kameraj focused on it prematurely from the square 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.130
 a 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.830
 Final score 2 1 and we are should have lost the game because I thought I think 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.350
 we are 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.430
 Until this is in the area was a pretty good players 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.210
 Mosimann only scored ten and Pittsburgh animals ringed two to zero 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 So that's for me already playing tickets situation 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 Round the end of their play certainly can keep longer open 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490
 if double the referee of the important with their divorce 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 united in their workday self-measurement agenda grinder on a wall once hung 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.420
 one completely different really alone on a second half then the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.869
 ex-trainer Taliban Christina Hengster Once I have a small one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.500
 tell dealers 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.380
 the writers the cheering Charlene Hartmann 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680
 On it she had another opportunity but narrowly failed 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.000
 the eleven of Martina Voss are now constantly in the forward Kay in the 67 minute 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.650
 brought the coaches Fassbind Khalid Sheikh and Marith PrieÃŸen 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 only minutes on the pitch ensured Kai she is on double pass also 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.419
 Substitute Turid Knaak for the 14 o'clock 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.979
 I find it inappropriate 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.569
 again customers 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.909
 but in the team and Duisburg the EBT in technical-tactical area 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.959
 Percent in my view should be the best team are the Emser 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.769
 I could not rest that was not done by me, so I'm really 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.369
 Percent was very happy with the game 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:43.560
 after a wonderful pass from Bresonik Mark made the final point 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.180
 even if more was possible Duisburg remains clearly on success 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.129
 ahead 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.840
 We have agreed in the cabin all want to Berlin and the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.839
 right now the latter is not active 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:59.719
 You can then help percent of the 2 so the team has shown from the 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.529
 first moment and then it will be nice if the broadcast Eischnee whether 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.429
 he then in two or five new bands anyway is just our philosophy 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.769
 to play forward that he spent a long time in two Monser Vervoort and other times the 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.189
 tackle last task in Munich and we want to semi-finals I treasures 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.629
 they have taxes as with minors and recorded since that they have too 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.409
 the time story as a reason became 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.989
 and therefore not so that it can do that too 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.909
 This looks quite similar to his colleagues who also earned much praise otherwise 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.549
 I find it very clear that nobody really learns him a lot 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.659
 Trust tastes 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.349
 Above all, yes, there are also the young players very much hurt Mondsee 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.930
 Absolutely excellent training made perfect percent of good communication fit 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.329
 just everything else 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 So who is supposed to incentivize their roles 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:50.509
 Michelle's parents
