take advantage of these gains as they

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.850 
take advantage of these gains as they
target<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.610> steam<00:02:20.849> OS<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:22.170> their<00:02:22.440> new<00:02:22.680> and

what<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.640> OS<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.090> likely<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.600> be<00:03:33.720> attached<00:03:34.109> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
what the OS is likely to be attached to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.550 
what the OS is likely to be attached to
which<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.859> steam<00:03:35.220> box<00:03:35.459> which<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:36.870> far<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.319> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
which is a steam box which as far as I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.370 
which is a steam box which as far as I
can<00:03:37.620> tell<00:03:37.980> right<00:03:38.010> now<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:38.670> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.000> be<00:03:39.380> sort

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
can tell right now it's going to be sort

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740 
can tell right now it's going to be sort
of<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.560> small<00:03:40.920> PC<00:03:41.489> built<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.239> living<00:03:42.569> room

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
of a small PC built for the living room

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.990 
of a small PC built for the living room
that<00:03:43.230> again<00:03:43.500> will<00:03:44.100> allow<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.670> stream

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that again will allow you to stream

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.400 
that again will allow you to stream
games<00:03:45.359> from<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:46.200> computer<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:48.109> take<00:03:49.109> advantage

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
games from a computer and take advantage

games from a computer and take advantage
of<00:03:49.620> everything<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.040> computer<00:03:50.370> has<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.670> offer

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
of everything the computer has to offer

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.640 
of everything the computer has to offer
I<00:03:50.970> just<00:03:51.329> think<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.780> could<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
I just think that this could really be a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.830 
I just think that this could really be a
very<00:03:53.160> big<00:03:53.489> thing<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.510> if

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
very big thing if they do it right if

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.809 
very big thing if they do it right if
they<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> right<00:03:55.470> price<00:03:55.709> point<00:03:56.069> once<00:03:56.670> we

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
they get a right price point once we

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.090 
they get a right price point once we
find<00:03:57.180> out<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.750> again<00:03:58.200> expected<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.920> later

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
find out it is again expected that later

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.530 
find out it is again expected that later
this<00:03:59.280> week<00:03:59.489> we're<00:03:59.670> gonna<00:03:59.730> find<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.120> exactly

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
this week we're gonna find out exactly

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.210 
this week we're gonna find out exactly

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
make changes we have the closed systems

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
make changes we have the closed systems
in<00:04:22.140> Microsoft<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.970> Sony<00:04:24.240> consoles<00:04:24.950> these

in Microsoft and the Sony consoles these

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.870 
in Microsoft and the Sony consoles these
things

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
things

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.390 
things
sometimes<00:04:27.360> there<00:04:28.110> are<00:04:28.140> significant<00:04:28.890> barriers

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
sometimes there are significant barriers

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.210 
sometimes there are significant barriers
when<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.820> comes<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.500> developers<00:04:31.500> pushing<00:04:32.100> out

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
when it comes to developers pushing out

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.100 
when it comes to developers pushing out
updates<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.850> their<00:04:33.000> games<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.450> example<00:04:33.540> and

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
updates to their games for example and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.080 
updates to their games for example and
because<00:04:34.890> it's<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.100> lot<00:04:35.250> easier<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.670> do<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.970> on

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
because it's a lot easier to do that on

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.840 
because it's a lot easier to do that on
PC<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.660> will<00:04:36.750> then<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.950> a<00:04:37.980> lot<00:04:38.190> easier<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.520> do<00:04:38.730> it

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
PC it will then be a lot easier to do it

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.330 
PC it will then be a lot easier to do it
through<00:04:39.000> steam<00:04:39.270> OS<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.960> again<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.040> steam

through steam OS and again on the steam
box<00:04:41.610> once<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.120> eventually<00:04:42.540> gets<00:04:42.690> announced

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
box once that eventually gets announced

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.240 
box once that eventually gets announced
now<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.320> still<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> few<00:04:43.920> big<00:04:44.100> major

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
now we still have a few big major

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.440 
now we still have a few big major
announcements<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.000> come<00:04:45.030> throughout<00:04:45.330> the

announcements to come throughout the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.630 
announcements to come throughout the
course<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.900> week<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.350> once<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.430> does

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
course of this week and once that does

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.950 
course of this week and once that does
happen<00:04:47.850> I'll<00:04:48.120> be<00:04:48.240> sure<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.510> update<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.810> guys

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
happen I'll be sure to update you guys

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.040 
happen I'll be sure to update you guys
as<00:04:49.560> well<00:04:50.000> but<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.180> think<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.570> is<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.750> step

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
as well but that I think this is a step

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.290 
as well but that I think this is a step
in<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.290> really<00:04:52.560> exciting<00:04:52.890> direction<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:54.180> know

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
in a really exciting direction you know

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.750 
in a really exciting direction you know
even<00:04:54.780> if<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.350> aren't<00:04:55.890> necessarily<00:04:56.070> someone

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
even if you aren't necessarily someone

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.480 
even if you aren't necessarily someone
who<00:04:56.940> likes<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.390> game<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.170> couch<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:59.130> front<00:04:59.370> of

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
who likes to game on a couch in front of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.820 
who likes to game on a couch in front of
a<00:04:59.550> TV<00:04:59.790> like<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.450> console<00:05:00.870> gaming<00:05:01.080> experience

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
a TV like the console gaming experience

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.400 
a TV like the console gaming experience
this<00:05:02.460> could<00:05:02.700> be<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.850> big<00:05:03.210> shake-up<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:04.170> and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
this could be a big shake-up and and

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.700 
this could be a big shake-up and and
this<00:05:04.680> could<00:05:04.890> be<00:05:04.940> really<00:05:06.200> we're<00:05:07.200> looking<00:05:07.230> at

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
this could be really we're looking at

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.190 
this could be really we're looking at
potentially<00:05:08.310> valve<00:05:08.610> entering<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.570> space<00:05:09.870> of
