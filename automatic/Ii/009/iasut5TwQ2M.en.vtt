00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
character development team so we could

so<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.920> far<00:00:35.100> he<00:00:35.219> hasn't<00:00:35.370> done<00:00:35.550> too

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
so for here so far he hasn't done too

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030 
so for here so far he hasn't done too
much<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.210> can't<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.570> judge<00:00:36.809> him<00:00:37.140> he

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
much so we can't really judge him he

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.369 
much so we can't really judge him he
looks<00:00:38.250> beastly<00:00:38.700> though<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.719> also<00:00:39.930> have

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
looks beastly though then we also have

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
looks beastly though then we also have
the<00:00:40.800> previously<00:00:41.550> chikage<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.270> seemingly

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the previously chikage what seemingly

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
the previously chikage what seemingly
was<00:00:43.050> sealed<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.980> seem<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.610> some

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
was sealed but there seem to be some

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
was sealed but there seem to be some
mystique<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.200> where<00:00:46.920> he<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.430> had<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
mystique about it where he was had a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
mystique about it where he was had a
couple<00:00:48.120> extra<00:00:48.270> words<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> say<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
couple extra words to say I'm still and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
couple extra words to say I'm still and
then<00:00:50.789> he<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.329> sealed<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.050> maybe<00:00:52.350> there's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
then he got sealed up so maybe there's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
then he got sealed up so maybe there's
more<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.489> meets<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> eye

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
more to it than meets the eye

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
more to it than meets the eye
and<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.579> there's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and then we also had let's see there's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
and then we also had let's see there's
no<00:00:56.850> Hokage<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.660> had<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.109> cog<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.620> Kazakh

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
no Hokage we had the right cog a Kazakh

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.209 
no Hokage we had the right cog a Kazakh

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
cog a the suci cog a and then there's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.509

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
my opinion this episode one of the big

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.180 
my opinion this episode one of the big
downward<00:02:51.540> spirals<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.410> or<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
downward spirals of it or one of the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.980 
downward spirals of it or one of the
things<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.520> disliked<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.390> most<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
things that I disliked the most was the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.360 
things that I disliked the most was the
music<00:02:55.260> Robbie<00:02:55.470> himself<00:02:55.950> maybe<00:02:56.130> I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
music Robbie himself maybe I'm

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.110 
music Robbie himself maybe I'm
overreacting

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
overreacting

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.050 
overreacting
but<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.990> just<00:02:58.050> didn't<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.800> him<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.190> felt

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
but I just didn't like him I just felt

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.700 
but I just didn't like him I just felt
like<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.930> much<00:03:01.080> filler<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:01.560> him

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
like there was so much filler with him

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.160 
like there was so much filler with him
and<00:03:01.890> he<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.070> did<00:03:02.640> not<00:03:02.880> seem<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.690> too<00:03:03.990> much

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and he just did not seem like too much

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.540 
and he just did not seem like too much
of<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.380> formidable<00:03:04.680> threat<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.190> mean<00:03:05.370> really

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
of a formidable threat I mean really

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.880 
of a formidable threat I mean really
he's<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.240> hiding<00:03:06.450> with<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> clam<00:03:07.200> while

techniques but for me

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.030 
techniques but for me
planetary<00:05:06.690> Rasengan<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.410> where<00:05:07.590> is<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.740> and

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
planetary Rasengan is where is that and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.200

what sort of the moves that normal to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.540 
what sort of the moves that normal to
add<00:05:09.330> because<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.870> love<00:05:10.260> how<00:05:10.440> Naruto<00:05:11.160> has<00:05:11.340> like

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550

variations<00:05:13.230> of<00:05:13.290> Rasengan<00:05:13.890> but<00:05:14.070> they<00:05:14.190> look

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
variations of Rasengan but they look

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.770 
variations of Rasengan but they look
pretty<00:05:14.940> different<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.510> they<00:05:15.570> look

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
pretty different and they look

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.080 
pretty different and they look
action-packed<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.980> get<00:05:17.100> cool<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.700> that's<00:05:17.940> one

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
action-packed to get cool and that's one

action-packed to get cool and that's one
