00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
just for me it just seems to be the best

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.579

one<00:00:05.580> so<00:00:05.819> far<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.720> course<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.200> always<00:00:07.350> one

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
one so far of course it is always one

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.110 
one so far of course it is always one
around<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> corner<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:08.730> seems<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
around the corner but this one seems to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.810 
around the corner but this one seems to
work<00:00:09.269> I'll<00:00:09.450> tell<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> why<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.590> when<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> use
