ramp<00:02:10.170> oh<00:02:11.090> yeah<00:02:12.090> isn't<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> pretty<00:02:12.720> sight

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
ramp oh yeah isn't that a pretty sight

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.020 
ramp oh yeah isn't that a pretty sight
if<00:02:13.320> for<00:02:13.770> those<00:02:13.890> who<00:02:13.920> don't<00:02:14.160> know<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.730> memory

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
if for those who don't know what memory

management means if you get a blue
screen<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.830> death<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.160> means<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.520> one<00:02:17.640> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
screen of death it means that one of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.630 
screen of death it means that one of
your<00:02:17.880> sticks<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.450> ram<00:02:18.690> has<00:02:18.960> died<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.620> fact<00:02:20.430> two

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
your sticks of ram has died in fact two

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.700 
your sticks of ram has died in fact two
sticks<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> my<00:02:21.120> REM<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.570> actually<00:02:22.020> died<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
sticks of my REM have actually died and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
sticks of my REM have actually died and
they<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.040> both<00:02:23.430> came<00:02:23.670> out<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> same

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
they actually both came out of the same

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.330 
they actually both came out of the same
package<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.500> makes<00:02:25.650> me<00:02:25.800> wonder<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.190> there

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
package so that makes me wonder if there

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480 
package so that makes me wonder if there
is<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> manufacturer<00:02:27.270> defect<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
is a manufacturer defect so here I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.690 
is a manufacturer defect so here I
managed<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.050> record<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.440> testing<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.490> RAM

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
managed to record the testing of the RAM

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700 
managed to record the testing of the RAM
to<00:02:32.850> see<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.210> was<00:02:33.270> actually<00:02:33.660> dead<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.020> not<00:02:34.140> so

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
to see if it was actually dead or not so

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.730 
to see if it was actually dead or not so
i<00:02:34.740> used<00:02:35.010> memtest86<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.600> test<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.050> just

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
i used memtest86 for this test and just

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.140 
i used memtest86 for this test and just
have<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> look<00:02:38.040> at<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> results<00:02:38.670> guys<00:02:38.820> it's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
have a look at the results guys it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970 
have a look at the results guys it's
really<00:02:39.750> mind-blowing<00:02:40.110> what<00:02:40.470> happened<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> my

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
really mind-blowing what happened to my

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.610 
really mind-blowing what happened to my
ram<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> clarify<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.110> boost<00:02:43.290> any<00:02:43.560> of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
ram just to clarify it and boost any of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
ram just to clarify it and boost any of
the<00:02:43.740> voltage<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.640> didn't<00:02:45.000> overclock<00:02:45.420> my

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the voltage and I didn't overclock my

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
the voltage and I didn't overclock my
ram<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.900> ran<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.380> at<00:02:46.470> eighteen<00:02:46.860> sixty<00:02:47.190> six

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
ram i ran it at eighteen sixty six

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
ram i ran it at eighteen sixty six
megahertz<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> don't<00:02:48.240> think<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.600> caused<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
megahertz so I don't think I caused the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.790 
megahertz so I don't think I caused the
problem

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.440 

as<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.099> see<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.520> screen<00:02:58.640> memtest86

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
recognized that my ram was bad now just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.290 
recognized that my ram was bad now just
have<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> look<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.980> how<00:03:04.129> many<00:03:04.190> errors<00:03:04.610> that

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
memtest gives me for my ram it's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.670 
memtest gives me for my ram it's
ridiculous<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.750> amount<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.050> errors<00:03:09.500> that

ridiculous the amount of errors that

is<00:03:11.500> mind-boggling<00:03:12.500> now<00:03:13.040> these<00:03:13.190> errors

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
is mind-boggling now these errors

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.380 
explain why I've had such a difficult
time<00:03:15.530> trying<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.099> edit<00:03:16.640> video<00:03:17.150> together

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
time trying to edit video together

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.000 
time trying to edit video together
because<00:03:17.959> every<00:03:18.319> time<00:03:18.349> I<00:03:18.530> edit<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.890> video

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
because every time I edit a video

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.920 
because every time I edit a video
together<00:03:19.340> my<00:03:19.940> computer<00:03:20.300> would<00:03:20.450> crash<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
together my computer would crash and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
together my computer would crash and
give<00:03:21.050> me<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.319> blue<00:03:21.650> screen<00:03:21.950> message<00:03:22.310> the

give me this blue screen message the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.800 
give me this blue screen message the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
memory management screen that I showed

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.410 
memory management screen that I showed
earlier<00:03:24.340> after<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.640> trouble<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:26.030> did<00:03:26.269> go

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
earlier after all that trouble I did go

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.210 
earlier after all that trouble I did go
out<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.660> buy<00:03:26.750> another<00:03:26.900> kit<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.530> RAM<00:03:27.769> from

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
out and buy another kit of RAM from

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.890 
out and buy another kit of RAM from
Coursera<00:03:28.790> now<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:28.970> think<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.330> was<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.720> fluke

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
Coursera now I think it was just a fluke

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.449 
Coursera now I think it was just a fluke
that<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.170> got<00:03:30.410> these<00:03:30.590> sticks<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.040> ram<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.370> were

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
that I got these sticks of ram that were

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.250 
that I got these sticks of ram that were
bad<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:32.299> that's<00:03:32.660> something<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.959> keep<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.200> mind

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
bad but that's something to keep in mind

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.660 
bad but that's something to keep in mind
when<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.560> guys<00:03:33.680> by<00:03:33.950> memory<00:03:34.340> because<00:03:34.579> you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
when you guys by memory because you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.220 
when you guys by memory because you
can't<00:03:34.880> return<00:03:35.000> memory<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.690> want<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.959> buy<00:03:36.200> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
can't return memory you want to buy it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.559 
can't return memory you want to buy it
so<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:36.950> hope<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> guys<00:03:37.459> enjoyed<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:38.000> unboxing
