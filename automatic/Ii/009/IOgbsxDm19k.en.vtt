00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 hello today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.110
 make an orange dessert that comes out 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.820
 delicious and you can do it with 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.040
 ingredients that you have in the house as well 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.080
 which is very economical besides what 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
 you can do in 20 minutes is ready 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.430
 I'm going to tell you the ingredients that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.650
 let's use let's use a 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.520
 liter of orange juice as you see me 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.650
 apart a little in a glass afterwards 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 I will say for a liter of juice 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.470
 orange we're going to need a twig of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.340
 cinnamon two and a half teaspoons of 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.560
 maizena and we will occupy four to 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.070
 six tablespoons of sugar depending on 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.020
 how well they want it good from 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.590
 utensils we are going to occupy a spoon 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.200
 to move and a well where we can 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.300
 heat the juice first thing we're going to 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.510
 to do is to empty 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.020
 the three quarts of orange juice in 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.020
 the well 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.470
 we already make our orange juice in the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.390
 well let's learn our stove 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.360
 at high heat and let's wait for 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 takes good while our juice 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.440
 orange boils what we're going to do with 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.740
 our orange juice that we set aside 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.910
 that is cold let's add the two 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.940
 teaspoons and cornstarch and we're going to 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.370
 perfectly dissolve two tablespoons and 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.010
 good media in this case as they are very 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 then only two if the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.960
 they put races would be two and a half and we're going to 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.970
 start to show in the ruber to move 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.270
 until they completely disappear 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.270
 lumps 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.940
 already 10 minutes passed and the juice 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.710
 of orange is already boiling now what 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.860
 what we are going to do is put the slit 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.240
 cinnamon and let's measure with a spoonful 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.970
 tureen let's put 4 5 or 6 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.940
 spoonfuls of sugar I'm going to put 4 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.010
 because the orange juice was sweet 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.580
 it's orange season but when it's 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.530
 very well you do not have to put 5 or 6 as 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.990
 they will know how much sugar they are going to put 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.680
 well they are going to dissolve together they are going to 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.020
 dissolve the sugar in the juice and they go to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.300
 try a little bit carefully so as not to 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.250
 burn should be a little bit more 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.020
 sweet what you want 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.890
 be because when it's time to cool 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.110
 means a little sweet 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.560
 once you have poured the sugar and 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.170
 they moved they threw the cinnamon now they go to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.200
 pour the juice to that dissolved the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.830
 two and a half tablespoons of cornstarch 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 to take the juice that is already boiling and 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.330
 they're going to lower the average flame now they're going to 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.970
 be here moving it from 5 to 7 minutes 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.340
 they must be moving it because as 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.650
 we miss the mais in this is going to start 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.840
 thicken as if it were an atole and if 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.110
 they stop moving will hit in the background 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.710
 and you will see to burn from 5 to 7 minutes 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.960
 we will be moving every 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.360
 every little while so it does not stick 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.110
 well now it's kids for 7 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.820
 minutes 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.880
 and you can see since he took another 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.680
 consistency and appears more stunned or 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.379
 gelatin when this cool is going to stay 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.079
 Well with a harder consistency now 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.230
 what remains is turning off and letting 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.420
 cool 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.709
 I do not know at room temperature one hour and 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.200
 then put it at another time the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.200
 fridge 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.500
 and because this dessert was finished good 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.980
 this is the texture that remains of the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.820
 dessert although it looks like jello and also 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.820
 knows 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.820
 delicious 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.130
 not serving a glass and decorating it with 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.950
 a bit of orange 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.150
 also because it is this dish for them to 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.729
 like my girls at home 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.729
 occupy the cascaritas de nadal
