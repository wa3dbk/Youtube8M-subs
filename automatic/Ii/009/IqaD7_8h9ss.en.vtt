00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.880 

I<00:00:02.070> think<00:00:02.760> I<00:00:03.090> think<00:00:04.050> when<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.290> all<00:00:04.410> over<00:00:04.470> it

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
I think I think when it's all over it

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.059 
I think I think when it's all over it
just<00:00:05.130> comes<00:00:05.310> back<00:00:05.399> in<00:00:05.730> flashes<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.390> know<00:00:07.069> it's

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
just comes back in flashes you know it's

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.789 
just comes back in flashes you know it's
like<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> kaleidoscope<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.210> memories<00:00:09.500> it<00:00:10.500> just

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
like a kaleidoscope of memories it just

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:19.640 
like a kaleidoscope of memories it just
all<00:00:10.980> comes<00:00:11.160> back<00:00:13.100> but<00:00:14.100> he<00:00:14.309> never<00:00:14.549> does

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.920 

I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:20.490> part<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.789> me<00:00:20.939> knew<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.300> second<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> saw

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I think part of me knew the second I saw

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560 
I think part of me knew the second I saw
him<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.470> happen

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.010 

it's<00:00:26.050> not<00:00:26.170> really<00:00:26.470> anything<00:00:26.890> he<00:00:27.010> said<00:00:27.340> or

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
it's not really anything he said or

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.880 
it's not really anything he said or
anything<00:00:29.020> he<00:00:29.230> did<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.789> was<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.320> feeling<00:00:32.770> that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
anything he did it was the feeling that

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.100 
anything he did it was the feeling that
came<00:00:33.100> along<00:00:33.370> with<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:36.510> crazy<00:00:37.510> thing<00:00:37.840> is<00:00:37.960> I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
came along with it and crazy thing is I

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.210 
came along with it and crazy thing is I
don't<00:00:38.170> know<00:00:38.379> if<00:00:38.500> I'm<00:00:38.590> ever<00:00:38.620> gonna<00:00:38.920> feel<00:00:39.190> that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.680 
don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that
way<00:00:39.520> again

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
way again

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.520 
way again
but<00:00:42.320> I<00:00:42.350> don't<00:00:42.620> know<00:00:42.739> if<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:43.010> should

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.069 

how<00:00:46.489> can<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.820> devil<00:00:47.149> be<00:00:47.270> pulling<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.719> towards

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
how can the devil be pulling you towards

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.240 
how can the devil be pulling you towards
someone<00:00:48.410> who<00:00:48.500> looks<00:00:50.379> so<00:00:51.379> much<00:00:51.500> like<00:00:51.559> an<00:00:51.829> angel

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
someone who looks so much like an angel

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.010 
someone who looks so much like an angel
when<00:00:52.370> he<00:00:52.460> smiles<00:00:52.820> at<00:00:53.120> you

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.300 

maybe<00:01:00.710> he<00:01:00.920> knew<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.600> when<00:01:02.600> he<00:01:02.660> saw<00:01:02.900> me

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.620 

I<00:01:07.369> guess<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:08.390> lost<00:01:08.509> my<00:01:08.780> balance<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:10.630> think

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
I guess I just lost my balance I think

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.749

that<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.680> worst<00:01:12.860> part<00:01:13.189> of<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.369> all<00:01:13.490> wasn't

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
that the worst part of it all wasn't

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:40.450 
that the worst part of it all wasn't
losing<00:01:14.210> him<00:01:15.789> was<00:01:16.789> losing<00:01:17.119> me
