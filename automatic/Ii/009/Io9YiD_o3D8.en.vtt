side and then another one a little bit
shorter

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:25.779 
shorter

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.230 
shorter
that's<00:05:26.779> an<00:05:26.960> interesting<00:05:27.199> start<00:05:27.710> we<00:05:28.639> also<00:05:28.819> have

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
that's an interesting start we also have

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.320 
that's an interesting start we also have
some<00:05:29.599> some<00:05:30.560> pieces<00:05:31.039> of<00:05:31.219> foliage<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:32.000> stem

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
some some pieces of foliage and stem

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.320 
some some pieces of foliage and stem
left<00:05:32.629> from<00:05:32.930> our<00:05:33.169> iris<00:05:33.650> so<00:05:34.550> let's<00:05:34.759> place<00:05:35.060> one

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
left from our iris so let's place one

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.170 
left from our iris so let's place one
over<00:05:35.629> here<00:05:36.199> that<00:05:36.460> gives<00:05:37.460> us<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.729> little<00:05:37.939> bit<00:05:38.060> of

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
over here that gives us a little bit of

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.510 
over here that gives us a little bit of
a<00:05:38.270> backing<00:05:38.719> to<00:05:38.839> that<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.319> I<00:05:40.099> don't<00:05:40.129> like<00:05:40.310> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
a backing to that and I don't like to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.639 
a backing to that and I don't like to
waste<00:05:40.669> anything<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.449> let's<00:05:41.629> take<00:05:41.900> a<00:05:42.139> stemming

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:42.649 
waste anything so let's take a stemming

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:46.260 
waste anything so let's take a stemming
over<00:05:43.009> here<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.729> work<00:05:44.689> it<00:05:44.899> over<00:05:45.169> on<00:05:45.319> that<00:05:45.500> side

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
over here and work it over on that side

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.909 
over here and work it over on that side
now<00:05:47.270> of<00:05:47.449> course<00:05:47.719> you're<00:05:48.139> wondering<00:05:48.529> when<00:05:48.800> is

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
now of course you're wondering when is

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.610 
now of course you're wondering when is
he<00:05:48.979> going<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.250> use<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.520> daffodils<00:05:50.149> well<00:05:50.960> time

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
daffodils down and we're going to work

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.969 
daffodils down and we're going to work
some<00:05:55.939> daffodils<00:05:56.479> in<00:05:56.719> here<00:05:56.960> as<00:05:57.080> well<00:05:57.349> but<00:05:57.830> my

some daffodils in here as well but my
daffodils<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.699> this<00:05:58.849> particular<00:05:59.360> case<00:05:59.569> I'm

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
daffodils in this particular case I'm

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.749 
daffodils in this particular case I'm
going<00:05:59.899> to<00:05:59.960> use<00:06:00.020> as<00:06:00.319> a<00:06:00.349> focal<00:06:00.830> area<00:06:01.159> because

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
going to use as a focal area because

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.670 
going to use as a focal area because
dash<00:06:02.000> can<00:06:02.330> be<00:06:02.360> used<00:06:02.689> for<00:06:02.870> all<00:06:02.990> kinds<00:06:03.379> of<00:06:03.469> things

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
dash can be used for all kinds of things

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.980 
dash can be used for all kinds of things
we<00:06:03.830> can<00:06:04.009> use<00:06:04.039> them<00:06:04.339> for<00:06:04.550> linear<00:06:04.849> effects<00:06:05.300> but

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
we can use them for linear effects but

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.889 
we can use them for linear effects but
they<00:06:06.139> also<00:06:06.349> make<00:06:07.279> a<00:06:07.310> great<00:06:07.639> focal<00:06:08.210> flower<00:06:08.569> as

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:08.899 
they also make a great focal flower as

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:11.260 
they also make a great focal flower as
well<00:06:09.169> and<00:06:09.860> I'm<00:06:10.159> just<00:06:10.189> cutting<00:06:10.639> a<00:06:10.819> few<00:06:11.029> down

here<00:06:11.899> and<00:06:12.050> I'm<00:06:12.649> using<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:13.189> as<00:06:13.339> a<00:06:13.370> focal<00:06:13.849> point

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:14.149 
here and I'm using it as a focal point

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:16.240 
here and I'm using it as a focal point
right<00:06:14.240> on<00:06:14.419> this<00:06:14.719> side<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.349> I'm<00:06:15.860> going<00:06:16.069> to<00:06:16.099> do

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:19.399 
the exact same thing in terms of cutting

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.350 
the exact same thing in terms of cutting
it<00:06:19.610> down<00:06:19.639> and<00:06:20.229> creating<00:06:21.229> a<00:06:21.319> focal<00:06:21.770> area<00:06:22.360> over
