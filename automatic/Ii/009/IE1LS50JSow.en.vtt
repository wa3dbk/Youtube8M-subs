00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.460 
without like a shedding like dandruff
shetty<00:03:45.209> but<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.359> was<00:03:46.480> still<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.900> my<00:03:46.930> hair<00:03:47.320> and

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
shetty but it was still in my hair and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.030 
shetty but it was still in my hair and
then<00:03:48.430> probably<00:03:49.200> after<00:03:50.200> about<00:03:50.410> three<00:03:50.739> days<00:03:50.859> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
then probably after about three days I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.470 
then probably after about three days I
co<00:03:51.220> wash<00:03:51.400> my<00:03:51.609> hair<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.970> finally<00:03:52.239> got

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
co wash my hair and I finally got

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.569 
co wash my hair and I finally got
everything<00:03:52.840> out<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.950> process<00:03:54.160> was

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
everything out so that process was

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.319 
everything out so that process was
really<00:03:55.239> really<00:03:55.450> hectic<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:56.200> me<00:03:56.370> um<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.430> don't

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
really really hectic for me um I don't

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.020 
really really hectic for me um I don't
really<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:59.890> kind<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.280> took<00:04:00.430> away<00:04:00.670> from<00:04:00.730> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
really it kind of took away from the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.830 
really it kind of took away from the
experience<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.640> also<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.940> reason<00:04:04.359> why<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.480> don't

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
experience and also a reason why I don't

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.350 
experience and also a reason why I don't
know

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
know

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.770

I'll be repeating this process I saw a
tutorial<00:04:09.230> by<00:04:09.740> this<00:04:10.010> aesthetic<00:04:10.630> after<00:04:11.630> I

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
tutorial by this aesthetic after I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.640 
tutorial by this aesthetic after I
divine<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.920> she<00:04:13.730> actually<00:04:14.000> used<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:15.110> cheese

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
divine and she actually used a cheese

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.910 
divine and she actually used a cheese
grater<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:17.239> grind<00:04:17.570> her<00:04:17.840> up<00:04:18.049> before<00:04:18.230> she<00:04:18.470> using

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
grater to grind her up before she using

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.530 
grater to grind her up before she using
and<00:04:19.100> she<00:04:19.579> said<00:04:19.820> she<00:04:19.970> had<00:04:20.090> an<00:04:20.239> excellent

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.750 
they turned into like a blondish
concolor<00:05:25.130> so<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.210> was<00:05:26.330> really<00:05:26.360> nice<00:05:27.610> but<00:05:28.610> at

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
concolor so that was really nice but at

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.969 
concolor so that was really nice but at

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
the same time I did miss my gray hair

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.540 
the same time I did miss my gray hair
curl<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.760> my<00:05:31.790> gray<00:05:32.120> hair<00:05:32.390> so<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.890> also<00:05:34.130> has<00:05:34.400> an

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
curl of my gray hair so that also has an

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.830 
curl of my gray hair so that also has an
impact<00:05:34.729> or<00:05:34.910> whether<00:05:35.090> i'll<00:05:35.270> be<00:05:35.419> doing<00:05:35.570> this

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
impact or whether i'll be doing this

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.200
