we're at least 30 minutes later than
they<00:02:28.680> ought<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> guys<00:02:29.670> take<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.000> pretty

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
they ought so you guys take this pretty

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390 
they ought so you guys take this pretty
seriously<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.050> obviously<00:02:31.710> heat<00:02:32.070> up<00:02:32.250> your

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
seriously you obviously heat up your

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.390 
seriously you obviously heat up your
tires<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.970> are<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> running<00:02:34.400> okay

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
tires what are you running okay

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.140 
tires what are you running okay
basically<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.360> tires<00:02:36.660> are<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:38.670> need<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.970> heat

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
basically the tires are we need to heat

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.700 
basically the tires are we need to heat
up<00:02:39.180> because<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.780> temperature<00:02:40.320> outside<00:02:40.350> is

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
up because the temperature outside is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.440 
up because the temperature outside is
air<00:02:41.190> conditioned<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.880> then<00:02:43.070> our<00:02:44.210> tires<00:02:45.210> need

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
air conditioned and then our tires need

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.620 
air conditioned and then our tires need
to<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.720> hit<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.170> 40<00:02:46.500> degrees<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.070> run

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
to be hit up to 40 degrees to run

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.620
