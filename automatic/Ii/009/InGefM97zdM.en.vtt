hey guys def Medicare so we're back at
the<00:00:04.440> towers<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.460> game<00:00:06.210> update<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.720> change<00:00:06.990> just

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the towers a game update for change just

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.410 
the towers a game update for change just
came<00:00:07.440> out<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.859> patch<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:09.059> they<00:00:09.150> made<00:00:09.300> some

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
came out the patch and they made some

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.150 
came out the patch and they made some
changes<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.840> jumping<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> wanted<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.889> review

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
changes to jumping so I wanted to review

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160 
changes to jumping so I wanted to review
some<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.460> my<00:00:11.639> other<00:00:11.730> videos<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> stuff

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
some of my other videos see if the stuff

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.259 
some of my other videos see if the stuff
still<00:00:13.410> worked<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.670> noticed<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.059> few<00:00:15.210> things

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
still worked and I noticed a few things

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.040 
still worked and I noticed a few things
that<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.680> change<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
that are going to change about it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.460 
that are going to change about it
specifically<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> tower<00:00:19.470> climb<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:21.260> if<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
specifically the tower climb so if you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.140 
specifically the tower climb so if you
watch<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:22.980> tower<00:00:23.160> climb<00:00:23.369> video<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
watch the first tower climb video you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.670 
watch the first tower climb video you
know<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.289> tower<00:00:25.470> from

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
know that you can get up the tower from

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
know that you can get up the tower from
the<00:00:25.800> outside<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.539> back

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the outside and if you want to go back

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
the outside and if you want to go back
and<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> old<00:00:28.230> way<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> doing<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.949> go

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and see the old way of doing that go

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
and see the old way of doing that go
back<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.210> watch<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.510> other<00:00:30.539> video<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
back and watch my other video and if you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.280 
back and watch my other video and if you
watched<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.570> recent<00:00:33.750> videos<00:00:34.110> you've

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
watched some of my recent videos you've

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
watched some of my recent videos you've
probably<00:00:34.500> seen<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.890> jump<00:00:35.190> move<00:00:35.399> mechanics

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
probably seen the jump move mechanics

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
probably seen the jump move mechanics
video<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> made<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.140> kind<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> shows<00:00:37.710> how

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
video that I made that kind of shows how

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.780 
video that I made that kind of shows how
jumping<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> inclines<00:00:39.000> works<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.100> came<00:00:41.460> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
jumping on inclines works so I came in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
jumping on inclines works so I came in
wanted<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> test<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> tower<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
wanted to test the tower see if you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
wanted to test the tower see if you
could<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.040> still<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> outside

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
could actually still get out the outside

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
could actually still get out the outside
which<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.250> realized<00:00:47.910> something

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
which you can but I realized something

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.860 
which you can but I realized something
works<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.980> couldn't<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.460> before

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
works now that you couldn't do before

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.970 
works now that you couldn't do before
they<00:00:51.870> made<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.140> changes<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.530> jumping

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
they made some changes to jumping

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.970 
they made some changes to jumping
specifically<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.910> player<00:00:54.180> model<00:00:54.570> does<00:00:54.809> not

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
specifically the player model does not

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
specifically the player model does not
physically<00:00:55.980> look<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.610> high<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.750> i

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
physically look as high now which i

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
physically look as high now which i
think<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.379> combat<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.070> people<00:00:59.699> jump

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
think is to combat the people jump

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.380 
think is to combat the people jump
around<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> combat<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.180> change

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
around in combat but they didn't change

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210 
around in combat but they didn't change
the<00:01:03.690> actual<00:01:03.840> height<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> jump<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the actual height that you jump so that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
the actual height that you jump so that
means<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> still<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> same

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
means that you can still make the same

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
means that you can still make the same
jumps<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> we've<00:01:08.010> done<00:01:08.220> before<00:01:08.659> however

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
jumps that we've done before however

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
jumps that we've done before however
they<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.020> made<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.100> walk<00:01:11.340> up

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they have made it so you can walk up

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
they have made it so you can walk up
steeper<00:01:11.970> inclines<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> means<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
steeper inclines and what this means is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
steeper inclines and what this means is
before<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.840> climb<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> tower<00:01:16.350> would

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
before we would climb the tower would

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
before we would climb the tower would
use<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.070> incline<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
use this incline here but we can

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
use this incline here but we can
actually<00:01:18.720> walk<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> incline<00:01:19.950> now

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
actually walk on this incline now

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.510 
actually walk on this incline now
without<00:01:21.000> falling<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.950> that's<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> give

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
without falling and that's going to give

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.350 
without falling and that's going to give
us<00:01:23.780> an<00:01:24.860> option<00:01:25.860> combined<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> jump

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
us an option combined with the jump

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
us an option combined with the jump
mechanic<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.920> shorten

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
mechanic that's going to really shorten

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859 
mechanic that's going to really shorten
this<00:01:29.460> tower<00:01:29.670> climb<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> make<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this tower climb that's going to make it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
this tower climb that's going to make it
really<00:01:31.110> effective<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.310> let's<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
really effective so let's see if we can

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.370 
really effective so let's see if we can
do<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.090> real<00:01:33.270> quick<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.549> new<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.380> its

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
do that real quick it is new so I'm its

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.810 
do that real quick it is new so I'm its
kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> knew<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.340> we're<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> jump

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
kind of knew this so we're going to jump

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.440 
kind of knew this so we're going to jump
on<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.030> first<00:01:39.270> inclined<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:41.450> jump

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
on this first inclined here jump

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
on this first inclined here jump
straight<00:01:42.689> over<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> top<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
straight over the top and some what I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
straight over the top and some what I
was<00:01:44.220> planning<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> jump<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.390> first

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
was planning to jump on this first

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020 
was planning to jump on this first
inclined<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.290> jump<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.579> onto<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

white incline here and this this little
black<00:01:52.770> part<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.220> protrudes<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:54.000> bit

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
black part here protrudes a little bit

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.039 
black part here protrudes a little bit
so<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.899> bit

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so you want to take a little bit

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.810 
so you want to take a little bit
cautious<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:56.070> once<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.520> above<00:01:56.670> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
cautious but once you get above that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
cautious but once you get above that
you're<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> sprint<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.649> being

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you're just going to sprint up being

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.800 
you're just going to sprint up being
climb<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> jump<00:01:59.520> between

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
climb and jump between

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.340 
climb and jump between
and<00:02:01.200> I'll<00:02:01.409> put<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> straight<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.280> um

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and I'll put you straight up here um

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.530 
and I'll put you straight up here um
let's<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.829> quickly

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.170 

perfect<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.130> how<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> sticks<00:02:14.849> I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
perfect if you can see how that sticks I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
perfect if you can see how that sticks I
mean<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.900> much<00:02:16.080> faster<00:02:16.620> than<00:02:16.800> what

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
mean it's just so much faster than what

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.699 
mean it's just so much faster than what
the<00:02:17.130> previous<00:02:17.489> Tyra<00:02:17.700> climb<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.330> mean<00:02:18.870> it's

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
the previous Tyra climb is I mean it's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.410 
the previous Tyra climb is I mean it's
almost<00:02:19.950> faster<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.489> go<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.819> outside<00:02:20.970> than

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
almost faster to go up the outside than

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
almost faster to go up the outside than
it<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.750> go<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.050> inside<00:02:22.260> stairs<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:23.489> long

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it is to go up the inside stairs as long

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.199 
it is to go up the inside stairs as long
as<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.790> hit<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> jump<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> correctly<00:02:26.209> now

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
as you hit the jump to correctly now

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
as you hit the jump to correctly now
let's<00:02:27.390> try<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.690> no<00:02:27.840> max<00:02:33.049> well<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
let's try it no max well that was a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.199 
let's try it no max well that was a
match<00:02:34.769> climbing<00:02:35.250> outside<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> tower<00:02:35.970> in

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
match climbing outside of the tower in

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.059 
match climbing outside of the tower in
about<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:37.470> second<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:39.470> hopefully<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
about one second so hopefully this is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.430 
about one second so hopefully this is
gonna<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.400> useful<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.910> guys<00:02:42.260> leave<00:02:43.260> me<00:02:43.410> a
