getting tensed up and things aren't
going<00:00:17.080> your<00:00:17.290> way<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.580> very<00:00:18.730> easy<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.180> start

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
going your way it's very easy to start

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.390 
going your way it's very easy to start
looking<00:00:19.690> down<00:00:19.930> at<00:00:20.320> your<00:00:20.410> bike<00:00:20.650> or<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:21.190> start

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
looking down at your bike or you start

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.429 
looking down at your bike or you start
looking<00:00:21.580> down<00:00:21.910> at<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.480> top<00:00:22.720> of<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:23.020> jump<00:00:23.199> or

looking down at the top of the jump or
past<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:24.039> jump<00:00:24.279> or<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:25.150> know<00:00:25.240> if<00:00:25.330> you're

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
past the jump or you know if you're

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.939 
past the jump or you know if you're
jumping<00:00:25.779> a<00:00:25.840> double<00:00:26.199> where<00:00:26.380> there's<00:00:26.590> nothing

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
jumping a double where there's nothing

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.109 
jumping a double where there's nothing
in<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.130> middle<00:00:27.369> sometimes<00:00:27.730> you'll<00:00:27.880> start

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
in the middle sometimes you'll start

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.700 
in the middle sometimes you'll start
going<00:00:28.480> down<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.840> looking<00:00:29.109> in<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.289> gap<00:00:29.470> and

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
going down and looking in the gap and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.529 
going down and looking in the gap and
really<00:00:30.070> that's<00:00:30.640> not<00:00:30.880> where<00:00:31.090> you<00:00:31.210> want<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.449> be

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
really that's not where you want to be

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.049 
really that's not where you want to be
looking<00:00:32.129> essentially<00:00:33.129> what<00:00:33.400> will<00:00:33.550> happen<00:00:33.879> is

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
looking essentially what will happen is

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.940 
looking essentially what will happen is
that<00:00:34.090> your<00:00:34.360> body<00:00:34.630> is<00:00:34.750> going<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.110> follow<00:00:35.380> where

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
that your body is going to follow where

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.229 
that your body is going to follow where
it<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:36.430> look<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:36.790> this<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:37.000> basic

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
it is that you look and this is a basic

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.430 
it is that you look and this is a basic
lesson<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:37.899> learn<00:00:38.110> when<00:00:38.320> you're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
lesson that you learn when you're

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.799 
lesson that you learn when you're
driving<00:00:38.710> among<00:00:39.219> other<00:00:39.399> things<00:00:39.520> but<00:00:40.360> basically

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
driving among other things but basically

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.010 
driving among other things but basically
you<00:00:41.320> want<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.710> keep<00:00:41.829> your<00:00:42.730> eyesight<00:00:43.239> exactly

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
you want to keep your eyesight exactly

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.170 
you want to keep your eyesight exactly
where<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.290> want<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.640> if<00:00:45.969> you're

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
where you want to go so if you're

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.389 
where you want to go so if you're
jumping<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> new<00:00:47.170> Jump<00:00:47.440> even<00:00:48.160> if<00:00:48.250> you're

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
jumping on a new Jump even if you're

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.950 
jumping on a new Jump even if you're
going<00:00:48.700> too<00:00:48.969> slow<00:00:49.210> you're<00:00:49.420> going<00:00:49.660> too<00:00:49.780> fast

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
going too slow you're going too fast

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.380 
going too slow you're going too fast
whatever<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.800> case<00:00:50.950> may<00:00:51.190> be<00:00:51.219> you<00:00:52.149> want<00:00:52.329> to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
whatever the case may be you want to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.910 
whatever the case may be you want to
make<00:00:52.480> sure<00:00:52.539> that<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.020> you<00:00:53.140> come<00:00:53.379> up<00:00:53.530> over<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
make sure that is you come up over the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.950 
make sure that is you come up over the
top<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.579> jump<00:00:54.789> and<00:00:55.000> you<00:00:55.570> start<00:00:55.840> getting

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
top of the jump and you start getting

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.590 
top of the jump and you start getting
airborne<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:57.340> want<00:00:57.520> to<00:00:57.610> look<00:00:57.760> down<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.270> see

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
airborne you want to look down and see

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.270 
airborne you want to look down and see
right<00:00:59.020> about<00:00:59.199> where<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.530> want<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.800> land<00:00:59.980> and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
right about where you want to land and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.310 
right about where you want to land and
once<00:01:01.059> you<00:01:01.270> know<00:01:01.359> once<00:01:01.570> you're<00:01:01.719> headed<00:01:02.079> there

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
once you know once you're headed there

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.920 
once you know once you're headed there
and<00:01:02.559> you're<00:01:03.039> about<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.370> touch<00:01:03.670> down<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.750> you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and you're about to touch down then you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.480 
and you're about to touch down then you
actually<00:01:05.289> want<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.500> look<00:01:05.680> out<00:01:05.830> farther<00:01:06.190> down

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
actually want to look out farther down

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually want to look out farther down
towards<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.850> bottom<00:01:06.939> of<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.390> landing<00:01:07.659> so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
towards the bottom of the landing so

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.570 
towards the bottom of the landing so
that<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.320> don't<00:01:08.500> get<00:01:08.619> balled<00:01:08.890> up<00:01:09.040> as<00:01:09.250> soon<00:01:09.430> as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
that you don't get balled up as soon as

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.270 
that you don't get balled up as soon as
you<00:01:09.729> land<00:01:09.909> because<00:01:10.750> ultimately<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:12.159> you're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
you land because ultimately when you're

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.240 
you land because ultimately when you're
jumping<00:01:12.640> stuff<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.600> real<00:01:13.780> goal<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.740> sort

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
jumping stuff the real goal is to sort

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.490 
jumping stuff the real goal is to sort
of<00:01:15.369> flow<00:01:15.700> through<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> objects<00:01:16.689> you<00:01:17.320> know<00:01:17.439> you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
of flow through the objects you know you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.620 
of flow through the objects you know you
don't<00:01:17.770> ever<00:01:18.070> want<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.460> focus<00:01:18.790> on<00:01:19.060> one<00:01:19.330> point

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
don't ever want to focus on one point

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.539 
don't ever want to focus on one point
each<00:01:19.869> motion<00:01:20.170> should<00:01:20.500> flow<00:01:20.799> into<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.130> next

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
each motion should flow into the next

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.780 
each motion should flow into the next
and<00:01:21.700> if<00:01:22.180> all<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.540> sudden<00:01:22.840> you're<00:01:23.140> looking<00:01:24.040> to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
and if all of a sudden you're looking to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.510 
and if all of a sudden you're looking to
close<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.659> inhibits<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.280> flow

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
close to you it inhibits that that flow

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.429 
close to you it inhibits that that flow
from<00:01:27.549> happening<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.360> I'll<00:01:28.630> demonstrate<00:01:28.840> again

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
from happening so I'll demonstrate again

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:37.260 
from happening so I'll demonstrate again
looking<00:01:30.220> farther<00:01:30.490> ahead

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.569 

see<00:01:37.960> right<00:01:38.140> now<00:01:38.170> I'm<00:01:38.560> looking<00:01:39.070> at<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.399> take

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
see right now I'm looking at the take

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.770 
see right now I'm looking at the take
off<00:01:39.759> because<00:01:40.119> that's<00:01:40.329> where<00:01:40.539> I<00:01:40.570> want<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.869> be

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
off because that's where I want to be

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.300 
off because that's where I want to be
i'm<00:01:43.780> up<00:01:43.990> over<00:01:44.170> looking<00:01:44.619> at<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.799> landing<00:01:45.159> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
i'm up over looking at the landing and
