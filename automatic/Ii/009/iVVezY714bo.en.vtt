00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.060
 to action with a new chapter of a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.090
 video of the information on the xbox 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.680
 one as you will know on May 21 were 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.080
 taking information shortly after 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.450
 since in an hour they could not give much 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.100
 information needed then this one with 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.490
 the interviews and all that were 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 revealing more information also achieve 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.920
 retain information about 5 the others 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.650
 five games out of the 15 that will be drawn 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.830
 in this year 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.840
 that for example in the last chapter of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.180
 about the information exposed about five 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.860
 today I will expose another five that between 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.670
 they will be sting and bungie 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.809
 hey the five of 343 industries 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.239
 assassin's creed 4 that I think is from 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.739
 Ubisoft sends light I'm not sure 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.800
 which company is the same 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.790
 docs same way as ubisoft 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.620
 they are also to be able to be 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.760
 video conferencing via skype and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.680
 that's great for gamers because of 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.809
 Suddenly it gives you a bit of trouble the former 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.280
 loop to see and all that I do not know if they continue 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.610
 with the same or already flat out hurry 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.220
 skype share 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.570
 so it would be very good all that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.390
 skype aspect also something else I do not know 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.760
 why do I go through something else in the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.430
 xbox one console is going to have more than 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.910
 who more than 5000 million 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.890
 transistors is going to be amazing too 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.280
 will have integrated blu ray and 8 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.780
 gigabytes of ram memory that is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.859
 Fantastic personally I think a 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.200
 amazing news 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.460
 is going to be this kind of this kind of 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.770
 consoles is going to be like it's a 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 computer in a few words will have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.789
 too many things another one of the company 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 of microsoft is going to have more than 15,000 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.750
 servers in the first year of xbox live 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.890
 and in the future it will have more than 300,000 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.380
 servers without more than 300 thousand servers 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.289
 imagine more than what more servers 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.200
 of those that existed in 1999 in matters of 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.500
 the pc computer imagine are 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.880
 too many also microsoft announced a 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.680
 new television series of his 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.069
 halo franchise in association with 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.310
 steven spielberg that's going to be great 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.010
 week are a bit silly one more series 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.890
 apart from the forward in city but 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.500
 I I'm a big fan of halo me 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.120
 I 'm going to see it 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.040
 I'm going to miss a single chapter 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.290
 apart is going to be in partnership with 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.000
 steven spielberg is going to be amazing 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.980
 will also have a command called 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.319
 snap that could do two things at the same 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.879
 time on your home screen either 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.170
 play and watch your favorite movie or 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.959
 talk with your friends 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.870
 in skype as this news says we can 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.579
 be playing hey we do it to count and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.590
 suddenly we say amerena is 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.329
 appearing those here in the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000
 videogame let's see more or less how 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.280
 it was this story we went to a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.290
 movie or something like that we switched to 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.689
 youtube or we saw the series of forward to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.040
 down and we see the lask and how it was that 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.230
 it was improving things like that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.930
 and nothing else to it seems a very 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.659
 good idea that of the snap command 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 also guanghai lets you search 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.230
 television programs on the network to 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.780
 through your voice and create a guide 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.180
 personalized good as we already have the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.760
 TV only in the US but suffice 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.640
 let's tell that we are Americans 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.790
 and we say it is good and it goes straight 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.090
 to the espiel channel that's going to be great 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.319
 we will also be able to say antivir and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.560
 it goes here and it's going to change 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.299
 automatically to the mtv channel without 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.659
 need no control only with your 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.650
 voice command is going to be amazing 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:49.330
 also this type of command one guide 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.400
 is going to have this 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.870
 do you call a custom guide 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 these favorite channels are the most 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.590
 seen that that's going to be very used for 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.080
 the American community since they are 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.740
 of the people who more than most use 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.940
 the television for what it is and they are going 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.100
 to help a lot 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.670
 well this I'm not sure that this is 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.680
 the information so far so too 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.610
 I forgot to add that the company of 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.590
 Ubisoft on their official facebook page 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.150
 this one shared a link that says you 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.550
 liked the recent announcement of xbox one 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.990
 we from ubisoft will launch 6 games 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.090
 during the first year of life of the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.610
 console between them you are enrolled 4 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.510
 black flag and watch dax as I already know 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.940
 said 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.120
 I'm fascinated since he's going to get the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.270
 ubisoft company this assassin's creed and 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.510
 then he's going to draw three more games 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.300
 move to be amazing amazing is going to 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.630
 to be great just like this tells us if I 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.630
 they were liking 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.120
 I also think that they are going to make a new 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.950
 rabbit game 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.340
 just as ubisoft I'm not sure which one is 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.590
 his real name 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.520
 but if it's going to be one of raids I do not 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.740
 agreement how exactly it is but yes I 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.300
 I think they're going to take it out 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:16.030
 also to the one that I am now reviewing 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.199
 the ubisoft facebook page since 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.229
 to cooperative mode for two players 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.599
 of splinter cell black list no no no 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.550
 a good basis if I have more 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.810
 good information I'm going to cut the video 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.180
 and if I have more information, we follow 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.130
 very well because it manages to gather so much 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.380
 information about what is going to come more 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.810
 things about the xbox and between them is going to 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.750
 be an 8-core processor by the 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 md company that is going to be fantastic and 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.430
 that personally I would like to have a 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.860
 it will also have 500 gigabytes of 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.360
 memory that was going to be amazing too 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:55.800
 for example in the xbox of the slim xbox 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.810
 has 7 8 12 and 7 8 gigabytes and that does not 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.330
 I liked nothing nothing nothing nothing I had to 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.430
 buy a memory of 305 gigabytes 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.370
 so that I could install everything 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.530
 I need I also found two more games 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.630

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.950
