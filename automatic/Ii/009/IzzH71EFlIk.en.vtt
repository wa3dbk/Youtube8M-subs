00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
seems to be pretty high but actually

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
seems to be pretty high but actually
what<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.280> battery<00:01:29.280> which

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what you get here is the battery which

what you get here is the battery which

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
would actually develop your capacity

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.830 
would actually develop your capacity
which<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:32.880> important<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
which is very important because the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
which is very important because the
current<00:01:34.110> battery<00:01:34.409> gives<00:01:34.860> me<00:01:35.040> around<00:01:35.250> 20<00:01:35.430> for

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
current battery gives me around 20 for

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.510 
current battery gives me around 20 for
20<00:01:35.759> hours<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.390> usage<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> full<00:01:38.280> charge

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
20 hours of usage for the full charge

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300 
20 hours of usage for the full charge
and<00:01:38.930> this<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.380> literally<00:01:40.650> doubled<00:01:41.130> or

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and this would be literally doubled or

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.700 
and this would be literally doubled or
either<00:01:42.119> increase<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.049> bit<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.560> than

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
either increase a little bit more than

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
either increase a little bit more than
double<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> capacity<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.759> also<00:01:44.909> more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
double because the capacity is also more

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.010 
double because the capacity is also more
than<00:01:45.360> double<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.040> heavy<00:01:47.369> battery

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
than double so this is the heavy battery

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
than double so this is the heavy battery
from<00:01:49.020> Mugen<00:01:49.380> power<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.220> here's<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
from Mugen power so here's the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
from Mugen power so here's the
difference<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.509> terms<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> size<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
difference in terms of the size it's the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
difference in terms of the size it's the
same<00:01:52.710> except<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> difference<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.240> terms<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
same except the difference in terms of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
same except the difference in terms of
the<00:01:54.899> thickness<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.250> quite<00:01:56.490> thick<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the thickness so it's quite thick as you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.800 
the thickness so it's quite thick as you
can<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.070> quite<00:01:59.250> heavy<00:01:59.490> too<00:01:59.810> now

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
can see you and it's quite heavy too now

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
can see you and it's quite heavy too now
one<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> best<00:02:02.159> part<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.909> backer

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
one of the best part is that the backer

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.499 
one of the best part is that the backer
which<00:02:03.570> comes<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.790> package<00:02:05.790> also

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
which comes with the package also

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.520 
which comes with the package also
supports<00:02:07.049> NFC

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
supports NFC

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
supports NFC
so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> worry<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.119> most

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so you don't have to worry because most

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.580 
so you don't have to worry because most
of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.840> covers<00:02:10.110> which<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.379> can't

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of the back covers which you can't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.930 
of the back covers which you can't
really<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.979> support

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
really don't support

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
really don't support
NFC<00:02:12.360> feature<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.380> actually

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
NFC feature but this one actually

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
NFC feature but this one actually
support<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.250> pretty<00:02:14.460> much

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
support so that's pretty much

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.690 
support so that's pretty much
interesting<00:02:15.180> now<00:02:15.750> let<00:02:15.990> me<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.490> insert<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
interesting now let me just insert the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.800 
interesting now let me just insert the
battery<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:19.550> which<00:02:20.550> literally<00:02:20.910> stands<00:02:21.540> out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
battery here which literally stands out

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.270 
battery here which literally stands out
of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.020> smartphone<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.800> also<00:02:23.070> makes

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
of the smartphone and also makes

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
of the smartphone and also makes
smartphone<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> bit<00:02:24.120> heavier<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.690> again<00:02:25.380> what

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
smartphone a bit heavier but again what

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
smartphone a bit heavier but again what
you<00:02:26.070> get<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.960> battery<00:02:27.960> capacity

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
you get here is the battery capacity

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.070 
you get here is the battery capacity
which<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> mentioned<00:02:29.970> earlier<00:02:30.420> so

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
which is what I mentioned earlier so

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.710 
which is what I mentioned earlier so
here<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.620> go<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.610> insertion<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.150> very<00:02:33.420> easy

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
here we go the insertion is very easy

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.040 
here we go the insertion is very easy
the<00:02:34.490> back<00:02:35.490> panel<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.940> also<00:02:36.060> perfectly<00:02:36.570> set<00:02:36.840> up

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the back panel is also perfectly set up

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
the back panel is also perfectly set up
the<00:02:37.740> only<00:02:37.890> difference<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.550> phone

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the only difference is that the phone

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.610 
the only difference is that the phone
doesn't<00:02:39.000> look<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.690> normal<00:02:39.720> s4<00:02:40.410> right

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
doesn't look like your normal s4 right

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
doesn't look like your normal s4 right
now<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.040> looks<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.880> bit<00:02:41.910> different<00:02:42.270> when<00:02:42.690> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
now it looks a bit different when you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.410 
now it looks a bit different when you
look<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.050> from<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> backside<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.420> one

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
look it from the backside and one

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
look it from the backside and one
advantage<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.830> camera<00:02:47.220> is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
advantage of this is that the camera is

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
advantage of this is that the camera is
actually<00:02:47.460> saved<00:02:48.240> now<00:02:48.420> because<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.050> can

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
actually saved now because as you can

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.370 
actually saved now because as you can
see<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:50.100> totally<00:02:50.760> inside<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.570> area<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
see it's totally inside this area in the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.250 
see it's totally inside this area in the
back<00:02:52.800> cover<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.690> that's<00:02:54.690> pretty<00:02:54.900> much<00:02:55.080> safe

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
back cover and that's pretty much safe

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.600 
back cover and that's pretty much safe
for<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> camera<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.100> case<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> phone

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
for the camera so in case the phone

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.690 
for the camera so in case the phone
drops<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.750> camera<00:02:58.080> won't<00:02:58.230> be<00:02:58.410> hit<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.370> that's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
drops the camera won't be hit so that's

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.360 
drops the camera won't be hit so that's
the<00:03:00.000> Mugen<00:03:00.930> powers<00:03:01.170> battery<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> Samsung
