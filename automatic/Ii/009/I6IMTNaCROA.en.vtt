if<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.459> were<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.849> look<00:02:01.149> at<00:02:01.359> those<00:02:01.539> who<00:02:01.719> argue

we'll<00:02:02.319> hang<00:02:02.529> on<00:02:02.739> there's<00:02:03.399> no<00:02:03.669> way<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.119> they

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
we'll hang on there's no way that they

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.819 
we'll hang on there's no way that they

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.080 
stars are too far away you were but that
sort<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.080> thinking<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:11.950> what

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
hundred years ahead of us in which case

hundred years ahead of us in which case
it's<00:02:16.660> impossible<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.650> them<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> reach<00:02:18.580> us

it's impossible for them to reach us

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's impossible for them to reach us
but<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.569> there<00:02:20.140> are<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.410> thousand<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.310> million

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
but if there are a thousand a million

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.699 
but if there are a thousand a million
years<00:02:22.540> ahead<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.200> us

then<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.459> laws<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:25.120> physics<00:02:25.629> begin<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.290> open

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
then you laws of physics begin to open

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.380 
then you laws of physics begin to open
up<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.370> open<00:02:27.550> our<00:02:27.879> mind<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
up so we have to open our mind to the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
up so we have to open our mind to the
possibility<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.590> they're<00:02:29.830> not<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.069> a
