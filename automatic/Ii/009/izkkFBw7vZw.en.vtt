00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
session before I trade typically so I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.310 
session before I trade typically so I
saw<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.939> we've<00:01:24.479> been<00:01:24.659> basically<00:01:24.810> him<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
saw that we've been basically him in a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.640 
saw that we've been basically him in a
downtrend<00:01:25.740> most<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.880> prior<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
downtrend most of the time prior to that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so now we just step along and we've got

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
so now we just step along and we've got
a<00:01:32.070> breach<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> trendline<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> first

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a breach of the trendline so the first

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
a breach of the trendline so the first
thing<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.159> he<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.850> over

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
thing I'm going to do is he don't over

in 540 HP trend lines going upwards and
we<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> rules<00:02:00.869> getting<00:02:01.259> meat

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
we just just got the rules getting meat

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
we just just got the rules getting meat
for<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:02.460> shore<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.210> which<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> fast

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for down shore here which is the fast

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
for down shore here which is the fast
tricks<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.469> crossing<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> slow<00:02:05.100> tricks<00:02:05.430> in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

tricks is crossing the slow tricks in
the<00:02:05.759> fast<00:02:05.969> tricks<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> crossing<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> zero

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the fast tricks is crossing the zero

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
the fast tricks is crossing the zero
nice<00:02:08.280> angle<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> fast<00:02:09.149> tricks<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.690> we're

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
nice angle on the fast tricks so we're

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.240 
nice angle on the fast tricks so we're
going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.989> get

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
going to get

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.760 
going to get
good<00:02:10.460> separation<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.480> spreads<00:02:12.290> apart<00:02:12.410> on

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
good separation as this spreads apart on

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.970 
good separation as this spreads apart on
this<00:02:12.890> way<00:02:13.040> down<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:14.140> moving<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.440> along<00:02:15.770> here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this way down just moving on along here

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.260 
this way down just moving on along here
right<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.190> was<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.520> time<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.970> look<00:02:20.090> at

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
right this was the time to look at

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.910 
right this was the time to look at
training<00:02:20.540> even<00:02:20.960> though<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.350> were<00:02:21.470> below<00:02:21.770> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
training even though we were below the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.140 
training even though we were below the
crowd<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.460> below<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.850> coral<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:24.170> know<00:02:24.290> I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
crowd and below the coral I you know I

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.100 
crowd and below the coral I you know I
still<00:02:26.150> wouldn't<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:26.360> gotten<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:26.900> here

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
still wouldn't have gotten back here

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.810 
still wouldn't have gotten back here
because<00:02:27.440> there's<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> trendline<00:02:28.040> I've<00:02:28.580> got<00:02:28.730> to

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
because there's a trendline I've got to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.460 
because there's a trendline I've got to
see<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> break<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.420> streamline<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:30.020> well<00:02:30.200> so

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
see a break of the streamline as well so

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.580 
see a break of the streamline as well so
some<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.400> guys<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.970> say<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.810> me<00:02:33.020> th<00:02:33.260> but

he's not really working for you or
whatever<00:02:35.450> well<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.050> fact<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.470> th<00:02:36.950> B<00:02:37.220> has

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
whatever well the fact is that th B has

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.580 
whatever well the fact is that th B has
to<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.060> balanced<00:02:38.630> up<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:38.930> other<00:02:39.170> good

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
to be balanced up with other good

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.550 
to be balanced up with other good
trading<00:02:40.090> techniques<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.870> case<00:02:42.170> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
trading techniques so in this case the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.140 
trading techniques so in this case the
trading<00:02:42.950> technique<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.459> used<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:43.970> was<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
trading technique are used here was a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.560 
trading technique are used here was a
trend<00:02:44.480> line<00:02:44.630> break<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> even<00:02:46.550> though<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
trend line break so even though the the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.610 
trend line break so even though the the
rules<00:02:48.260> were<00:02:49.070> met<00:02:49.340> 40<00:02:50.180> HP<00:02:50.360> at<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:51.050> point<00:02:51.350> along

rules were met 40 HP at some point along

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.800 
rules were met 40 HP at some point along
here<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:51.860> even<00:02:52.310> here<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.730> rules<00:02:52.940> 40<00:02:53.300> HP<00:02:53.450> are

clearly we below the core below the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.840 
clearly we below the core below the
cloud<00:03:08.540> we've<00:03:09.140> broken<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.680> trendline<00:03:10.010> and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
cloud we've broken the trendline and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.680 
cloud we've broken the trendline and
we've<00:03:11.209> got<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.980> Trix<00:03:13.280> rules<00:03:13.550> me<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.360> I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
we've got the the Trix rules me so I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.620 
we've got the the Trix rules me so I
entered<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.049> trade<00:03:15.290> i<00:03:15.940> eated<00:03:16.940> basically<00:03:17.420> on

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
entered the trade i eated basically on

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.900 
entered the trade i eated basically on
the<00:03:17.870> wither<00:03:18.200> yellow<00:03:18.560> horizontal<00:03:19.100> liner<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.670> I

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the wither yellow horizontal liner so I

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.210 
the wither yellow horizontal liner so I
entered<00:03:20.360> basically<00:03:20.900> pretty<00:03:21.560> much<00:03:21.650> on<00:03:22.070> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
entered basically pretty much on the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.949 
entered basically pretty much on the
break<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.700> line<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.090> could<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.930> was

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
break of that line I could see it was

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.600 
break of that line I could see it was
inevitable<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:26.000> go<00:03:26.150> down<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.450> m1<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> on

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
inevitable so I just go down to m1 so on

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.710 
inevitable so I just go down to m1 so on
m5<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> rules<00:03:30.170> were<00:03:30.350> basically<00:03:30.680> met<00:03:30.980> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
m5 all the rules were basically met and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.170 
m5 all the rules were basically met and
but<00:03:32.720> rules<00:03:33.350> won't<00:03:33.620> meet<00:03:33.830> on<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.130> one<00:03:34.340> yet<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:34.790> we

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
but rules won't meet on in one yet so we

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.570 
but rules won't meet on in one yet so we
just<00:03:35.510> needed<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.049> happening<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:36.620> off

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
just needed to see that happening so off

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.979 
just needed to see that happening so off
we<00:03:37.850> go<00:03:37.880> we're<00:03:38.269> watching<00:03:38.630> watching<00:03:38.810> watching

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
we go we're watching watching watching

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.340 
we go we're watching watching watching
we<00:03:39.590> get<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:40.340> breach<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.810> trendline

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
we get the breach of the trendline

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.390 
we get the breach of the trendline
here<00:03:43.280> with<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.209> candle<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:45.110> not<00:03:45.950> happy<00:03:46.280> to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
here with this candle but not happy to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.830 
here with this candle but not happy to
yet<00:03:46.880> because<00:03:47.150> they<00:03:47.209> haven't<00:03:47.239> got<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.630> cross

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
yet because they haven't got the cross

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.009 
yet because they haven't got the cross
over<00:03:48.049> it<00:03:48.320> could<00:03:48.500> have<00:03:48.590> been<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.769> false<00:03:49.340> break

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
over it could have been a false break

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.910 
over it could have been a false break
but<00:03:51.019> as<00:03:51.110> soon<00:03:51.290> as<00:03:51.380> they've<00:03:51.470> got<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> cross

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
but as soon as they've got the cross

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.720 
but as soon as they've got the cross
over<00:03:52.220> here<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:53.950> looked<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.130> it's<00:03:55.370> solidly

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
over here and looked like it's solidly

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.090 
over here and looked like it's solidly
down<00:03:56.030> through<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.660> entered<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.410> trade<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.010> you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
down through I entered the trade so you

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.580 
down through I entered the trade so you
can<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.370> range<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.850> trade<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.590> yellow

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
can see range of the trade on the yellow

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.140 
can see range of the trade on the yellow
horizontal<00:04:01.280> we're<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:02.209> carry<00:04:02.989> on

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
horizontal we're so carry on

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
and as the trade develops we're watching

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.289 
and as the trade develops we're watching
watching<00:04:06.790> watching<00:04:08.819> didn't<00:04:09.819> really<00:04:09.970> go<00:04:10.090> back

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
watching watching didn't really go back

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.460 
watching watching didn't really go back
he<00:04:10.420> danced<00:04:10.629> me<00:04:10.810> very<00:04:11.049> much

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
he danced me very much

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.819 
he danced me very much
quite<00:04:12.400> pleased<00:04:12.610> with<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.720> clearly<00:04:14.560> we<00:04:14.799> got

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
quite pleased with it so clearly we got

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.800 
quite pleased with it so clearly we got
the<00:04:15.189> break<00:04:15.400> out<00:04:15.640> in<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.030> retesting<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the break out in the retesting of the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.650 
the break out in the retesting of the
trend<00:04:17.019> line<00:04:17.199> which<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.530> what<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.799> expect<00:04:18.220> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
trend line which is what we expect and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.360 
trend line which is what we expect and
then<00:04:19.660> we<00:04:19.870> just<00:04:20.019> carry<00:04:20.829> on<00:04:20.949> following<00:04:21.280> the

then we just carry on following the

then we just carry on following the
trade<00:04:21.639> through<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.810> I'm<00:04:23.380> just<00:04:23.530> watching<00:04:23.770> this

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
trade through and I'm just watching this

on the em1 at the moment and as we

on the em1 at the moment and as we
carried<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:27.479> you<00:04:28.479> know<00:04:28.570> we're<00:04:28.780> making<00:04:31.860> lower

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
carried on you know we're making lower

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
highs all the way through now you would

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.500 
highs all the way through now you would
have<00:04:35.979> known<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.610> if<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.060> watched<00:04:37.270> my<00:04:37.360> other

have known that if you watched my other

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.390 
have known that if you watched my other
video<00:04:37.840> for<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.169> same<00:04:38.380> day<00:04:38.590> on<00:04:38.889> that<00:04:39.100> on<00:04:39.280> the

video for the same day on that on the
Euro<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:40.000> actually<00:04:40.419> moved<00:04:40.780> my<00:04:40.930> stop<00:04:41.229> to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
Euro I actually moved my stop to

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.200 
Euro I actually moved my stop to
break-even<00:04:41.620> kind<00:04:42.610> of<00:04:42.729> somewhere<00:04:43.030> down<00:04:43.180> here

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
break-even kind of somewhere down here

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.230 
break-even kind of somewhere down here
now<00:04:43.889> again<00:04:44.889> I<00:04:45.160> could<00:04:45.580> have<00:04:45.669> got<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:45.970> on<00:04:46.120> this

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
now again I could have got out on this

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.560 
now again I could have got out on this
trade<00:04:46.539> for<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.949> good<00:04:47.949> twenty<00:04:48.310> nine<00:04:48.970> pups<00:04:49.360> at

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
trade for a good twenty nine pups at

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.590 
trade for a good twenty nine pups at
this<00:04:49.720> point<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.710> probably<00:04:50.949> should<00:04:51.250> have

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
this point and I probably should have

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.920 
this point and I probably should have
but<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:52.660> didn't<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.910> trim<00:04:55.180> down<00:04:55.449> was<00:04:55.690> just

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
but I didn't and the trim down was just

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.670 
but I didn't and the trim down was just
so<00:04:56.110> strong<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:58.030> didn't<00:04:58.750> mind<00:04:59.020> holding

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
so strong that I didn't mind holding

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.219 
so strong that I didn't mind holding
holding<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.580> position<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:01.360> bit<00:05:01.630> more<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:01.990> fact

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
holding this position a bit more in fact

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.870 
holding this position a bit more in fact
I<00:05:02.500> was<00:05:02.860> starting<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.250> look<00:05:03.460> at<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:03.699> is<00:05:03.849> a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
I was starting to look at this is a

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.439 
I was starting to look at this is a
longer-term<00:05:04.240> trade<00:05:04.720> on<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> m15<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.009> I

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
longer-term trade on the m15 so I

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.800 
longer-term trade on the m15 so I
carried<00:05:07.449> on<00:05:07.590> sticking<00:05:08.590> into<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.220> as<00:05:09.789> it<00:05:10.510> as

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
carried on sticking into it and as it as

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.290 
carried on sticking into it and as it as
it<00:05:11.080> developed<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.070> went<00:05:12.460> further<00:05:12.669> down<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
it developed and went further down I

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.939 
it developed and went further down I
finally<00:05:13.960> got<00:05:14.080> out<00:05:14.139> down<00:05:14.500> here<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:16.949> probably

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
finally got out down here and probably

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.379 
finally got out down here and probably
would<00:05:18.130> have<00:05:18.190> been<00:05:18.340> just<00:05:18.669> as<00:05:18.820> good<00:05:18.849> getting

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
would have been just as good getting

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.750 
would have been just as good getting
getting<00:05:19.810> out<00:05:19.960> back<00:05:20.229> here<00:05:20.470> because<00:05:21.280> in<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.550> end

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
getting out back here because in the end

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.339 
getting out back here because in the end
I<00:05:22.000> only<00:05:22.240> got<00:05:22.570> about<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.050> same<00:05:23.080> amount<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:25.349> here

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
I only got about the same amount so here

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.320 
I only got about the same amount so here
we<00:05:26.440> go<00:05:26.650> about<00:05:27.010> twenty<00:05:27.340> five<00:05:27.490> pups<00:05:28.030> when<00:05:28.240> you

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
we go about twenty five pups when you

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.730 
we go about twenty five pups when you
take<00:05:28.510> into<00:05:28.750> account<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.020> spread<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:31.740> that's

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
take into account the spread so that's

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.800 
take into account the spread so that's
that's<00:05:33.159> how<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.430> one<00:05:33.639> unfolded<00:05:34.270> now<00:05:34.479> I've

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
that's how that one unfolded now I've

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.040 
that's how that one unfolded now I've
just<00:05:35.080> switched<00:05:35.199> back<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.830> m5<00:05:36.729> just<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:37.930> as

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
just switched back to the m5 just so as

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.800 
just switched back to the m5 just so as
he<00:05:38.199> as<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.590> m5<00:05:39.190> unfolded<00:05:41.789> we<00:05:42.789> kind<00:05:43.090> of<00:05:43.270> drop

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
he as the m5 unfolded we kind of drop

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.020 
he as the m5 unfolded we kind of drop
down<00:05:44.280> probably<00:05:45.280> should<00:05:45.430> have<00:05:45.520> got<00:05:45.669> up<00:05:45.699> down

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
down probably should have got up down

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.730 
down probably should have got up down
here<00:05:46.300> there<00:05:46.479> was<00:05:46.570> plenty<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.260> profit<00:05:47.440> being

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
here there was plenty of profit being

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.159 
here there was plenty of profit being
made<00:05:47.919> at<00:05:48.070> that<00:05:48.099> point<00:05:48.630> but<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.690> left<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:50.020> done

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
made at that point but I left it done

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.159 
made at that point but I left it done
with<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.349> stop<00:05:50.880> but<00:05:51.880> but<00:05:52.419> naught<00:05:52.659> he<00:05:52.810> should

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
with a stop but but naught he should

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.500 
with a stop but but naught he should
have<00:05:53.289> taken<00:05:53.590> it<00:05:53.650> out<00:05:54.090> there<00:05:55.090> was<00:05:55.210> no<00:05:55.330> other

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
have taken it out there was no other

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.779 
have taken it out there was no other
opportunity<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.349> take<00:05:56.530> it<00:05:56.560> out<00:05:56.830> there<00:05:57.099> and<00:05:57.639> I

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
opportunity to take it out there and I

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.879 
opportunity to take it out there and I
didn't<00:05:58.180> this<00:05:58.539> is<00:05:58.720> how<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:58.960> can<00:05:59.229> lose<00:05:59.470> money<00:05:59.500> if

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
didn't this is how you can lose money if

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.640 
didn't this is how you can lose money if
you're<00:06:00.010> not<00:06:00.039> too<00:06:00.310> careful<00:06:00.550> but<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:02.169> trend<00:06:02.470> was

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
you're not too careful but the trend was

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.370 
you're not too careful but the trend was
down<00:06:03.520> anyway<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:04.090> what<00:06:04.630> I<00:06:04.659> was<00:06:04.840> looking<00:06:05.139> for

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
down anyway so what I was looking for

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.559 
down anyway so what I was looking for
was<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:06.250> we'd<00:06:06.400> made<00:06:06.639> a<00:06:06.669> low

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
was that we'd made a low

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.689 
was that we'd made a low
lo<00:06:07.779> than<00:06:08.050> previously<00:06:08.619> and<00:06:08.979> then<00:06:09.339> we<00:06:09.490> made<00:06:09.669> a

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
lo than previously and then we made a

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.389 
lo than previously and then we made a
lower<00:06:10.059> higher<00:06:10.539> than<00:06:10.929> previously<00:06:11.529> so<00:06:12.219> it's

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
lower higher than previously so it's

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.040 
lower higher than previously so it's
quite<00:06:12.580> happy<00:06:12.879> to<00:06:12.909> kind<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.360> whole<00:06:13.539> gun<00:06:13.779> here

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
quite happy to kind of whole gun here

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.169 
quite happy to kind of whole gun here
because<00:06:14.379> to<00:06:14.649> me<00:06:14.830> trended<00:06:15.399> definitely<00:06:15.849> change

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:16.179 
because to me trended definitely change

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:19.350 
because to me trended definitely change
direction<00:06:16.539> so<00:06:17.529> and<00:06:18.249> then<00:06:19.059> we<00:06:19.149> made<00:06:19.330> another

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
direction so and then we made another

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.779 
direction so and then we made another
lower<00:06:19.899> low<00:06:20.199> so<00:06:20.619> the<00:06:20.740> expectation<00:06:21.429> is<00:06:21.550> on<00:06:21.669> the

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
lower low so the expectation is on the

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.399 
lower low so the expectation is on the
next<00:06:22.029> part<00:06:22.270> it<00:06:22.449> could<00:06:22.629> make<00:06:22.839> even<00:06:23.169> another

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
next part it could make even another

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.679 
next part it could make even another
wire<00:06:23.679> high<00:06:23.979> but<00:06:24.309> by<00:06:24.490> this<00:06:24.550> point<00:06:24.729> I'm<00:06:25.360> thinking

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
wire high but by this point I'm thinking

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.439 
wire high but by this point I'm thinking
it's<00:06:26.469> getting<00:06:26.589> close<00:06:26.949> to<00:06:27.309> another<00:06:27.849> major<00:06:28.089> news

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
it's getting close to another major news

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.749 
it's getting close to another major news
announcement<00:06:29.050> I'm<00:06:29.800> going<00:06:30.039> to<00:06:30.099> get<00:06:30.249> out<00:06:30.399> and

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
that's what I did looking at the

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.249 
that's what I did looking at the
analysis<00:06:34.449> on<00:06:34.599> the<00:06:34.629> m15<00:06:35.819> we<00:06:36.819> we<00:06:37.419> just<00:06:37.449> see<00:06:38.110> that

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
analysis on the m15 we we just see that

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.230 
analysis on the m15 we we just see that
going<00:06:38.499> through<00:06:38.709> the<00:06:38.889> motions<00:06:39.279> broke<00:06:39.849> through

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
going through the motions broke through

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.570 
going through the motions broke through
I<00:06:40.449> entered<00:06:40.990> I've<00:06:41.649> drawn<00:06:41.949> where<00:06:42.189> I<00:06:42.219> entered

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
I entered I've drawn where I entered

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.209

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
know if I had to move my stop to

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.790 
know if I had to move my stop to
break-even<00:06:46.809> I<00:06:47.020> would<00:06:47.139> have<00:06:47.229> been<00:06:47.319> taken<00:06:47.680> out

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
break-even I would have been taken out

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.790 
break-even I would have been taken out
but<00:06:48.099> my<00:06:48.610> stop<00:06:48.909> was<00:06:49.059> above<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.449> trend<00:06:49.689> line<00:06:49.800> so

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800

got<00:06:55.749> out<00:06:55.959> here<00:06:56.259> it<00:06:56.680> could<00:06:56.919> have<00:06:57.009> ended<00:06:57.159> up<00:06:57.339> with

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
got out here it could have ended up with
