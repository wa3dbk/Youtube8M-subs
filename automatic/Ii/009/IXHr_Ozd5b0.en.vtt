00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
divide this into three sections even

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
divide this into three sections even
sections<00:01:40.579> because<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> be

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
sections because you're going to be

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.700 
sections because you're going to be
making<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.329> four<00:01:42.570> strand<00:01:42.840> braid<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.530> the

ribbon in the second position on the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
ribbon in the second position on the
left<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.970> gonna<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.390> number<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.200> two

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
left so it's gonna be number one two

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.880 
left so it's gonna be number one two
three<00:01:49.799> four<00:01:50.299> starting<00:01:51.299> from<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> left<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.320> on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
three four starting from the left so on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170

the right though you're gonna pass
number<00:01:54.600> four<00:01:54.960> over<00:01:55.380> number<00:01:55.649> three<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.340> then

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
number four over number three and then

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.020 
number four over number three and then
under<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> ribbon<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.320> number<00:01:58.740> two

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
under the ribbon which is number two

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.610

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
and you'll want to tuck that tail up so

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.930 
and you'll want to tuck that tail up so
it's<00:03:19.290> hidden<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.769> well<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.370> her<00:03:20.489> hair<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.760> long

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it's hidden as well and her hair is long

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.449 
it's hidden as well and her hair is long
enough<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.840> wrap<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.320> full<00:03:22.590> time

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.089 

so<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.629> use<00:03:34.780> hair<00:03:34.989> pins<00:03:35.290> or<00:03:35.530> bobby<00:03:35.739> pins

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099
