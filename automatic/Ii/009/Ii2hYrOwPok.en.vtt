00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the of the top piece of wood is actually

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.639 
the of the top piece of wood is actually
thicker<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.659> thinner<00:02:00.719> excuse<00:02:01.320> me<00:02:01.439> than<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
thicker or thinner excuse me than the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.020 
thicker or thinner excuse me than the
treble<00:02:01.950> side<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.369> actually<00:02:02.729> brings<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
treble side which actually brings the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.389 
treble side which actually brings the
two<00:02:03.270> wavelengths<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:04.079> balance<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
two wavelengths into balance we do

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.010 
two wavelengths into balance we do
something<00:02:05.759> similar<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.659> electric

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
something similar with the electric

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749 
something similar with the electric
bodies<00:02:07.380> except<00:02:07.770> we're<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.099> doing<00:02:08.610> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
bodies except we're actually doing that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.330 
bodies except we're actually doing that
by<00:02:09.030> chambering<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.379> underside<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.160> piece

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
by chambering the underside of the piece

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160 
by chambering the underside of the piece
so<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> backside<00:02:12.080> actually

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so the backside actually

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.160 
so the backside actually
has<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.380> shallow<00:02:13.860> bass<00:02:14.730> chamber<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.990> goes

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
has a shallow bass chamber that goes

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.199 
has a shallow bass chamber that goes
along<00:02:16.440> with<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> deeper<00:02:17.069> treble<00:02:17.670> chamber<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
along with a deeper treble chamber that

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.670 
along with a deeper treble chamber that
when<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.810> play<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.650> really

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
when you play it it just it really

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.440 
when you play it it just it really
really<00:02:20.190> brings<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.910> balance<00:02:21.270> out

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
really brings that the balance out

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.699 
really brings that the balance out
that's<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.140> number<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.470> thing<00:02:22.500> we're

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that's that's the number one thing we're

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.350 
that's that's the number one thing we're
trying<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.920> accomplish<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.430> balance<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
trying to accomplish is balance and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.430 
trying to accomplish is balance and
another<00:02:24.630> thing<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.870> shows<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.410> know
