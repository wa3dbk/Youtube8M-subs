side<00:04:04.650> yes<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.459> suppose<00:04:05.850> also<00:04:06.150> they'll<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.600> to

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
side yes I suppose also they'll have to

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.780 
side yes I suppose also they'll have to
get<00:04:06.780> all<00:04:06.930> these<00:04:07.200> things<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.800> code<00:04:08.280> changes

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
get all these things and code changes

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.280 
get all these things and code changes
and<00:04:08.940> everything<00:04:09.209> right<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.690> done<00:04:09.900> first

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
and everything right and done first

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.540 
and everything right and done first
before<00:04:10.530> they<00:04:10.739> can<00:04:10.890> add<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.070> mobs<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.400> other

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.070 
before they can add the mobs and other
little<00:04:11.790> things<00:04:11.940> well<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.239> suppose<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.930> but

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
little things well I suppose it but

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.780 
little things well I suppose it but
hence<00:04:13.260> videos<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.739> might<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.220> as<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.580> year
