 light peanut vinaigrette that results 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.339
 terrific especially for women 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.960
 because they are fatty acids that are going to 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.510
 benefit you are from the ingredients of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.730

 cup of chopped peanuts and salt 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.989

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 hahaha this me robert you should not know 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 which is very difficult when you are in 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.390
 the university have the best 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.090
 salads or things you can cook 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.979

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 easy is very very easy to do and with 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.240
 a pot that has a pan cited a 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.190
 bit and for cooking you can already 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.770
 make a salad or warm say 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 what if they do not have everything raw goes and 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.630
 it's super good, it's just as good 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.049
 to put some oil in the pan 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.329
 that I should not even put them in 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.100
 waivers times that is at the maximum 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.329
 pan very very hot so that it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.000
 find our mushrooms well let's 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.090
 season with a little salt and pepper and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.799
 let's let them fill up and while 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.970

 mix it a little with the salt and the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.190
 pepper to incorporate and this we are going to 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:33.040
 flirt with lille olive oil 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.820
 not without first giving a spin to our 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.060
 mushrooms to burn 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.840
 Similar 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.849
 and keep beating I tell you this is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.670
 salad is rich in protein because 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.040
 It has a lot of mushrooms and also 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 has fatty acids that benefit us 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.180
 a lot especially women 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 Peanut has incredible properties 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.480

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.299
 the population of blood for 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.750
 men will also serve them 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:17.690
 kids cholesterol kids cholesterol 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.040
 peanut is peanut from the pretty 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.939
 peanuts and that's it 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.219
 the silence until rich not with a chela 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:40.590
 with a clear chela if a shrill 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:44.310
 hahaha this since it was 2 for 1 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.379
 a shoe no no because it has sugar there 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.319
 to use the peanut as they see it 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.900
 here of nice and cool look and if 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.250
 find low in sodium is that better 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.680
 they know what the best peanuts are 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.319
 those of the Christmas piÃ±atas 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.299
 those are the ones in shell those that 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.660
 you have to peel exactly I'm going to put the 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.500
 half of the peanuts here 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.540
 with my mushrooms 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.110
 and to this I am going to add also a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.110
 little garlic 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.770
 or 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.770
 let's put some scallion 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.730
 they are my interactive guys so I like 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.130
 I will remove from heat because my 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.010
 taste is good 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.180
 This mushroom, in my opinion, has not 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.300
 released a lot of water then if they set 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.750
 does not have water so it 's like the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.210
 right at your point you already saw that's what 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.790
 we want in your fire retreat 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.140
 I turn off here and now they come now 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.770
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.140
 to do is that what we are going to do 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.480
 they dried up to understand this now what 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.560
 let's do what we're going to do 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:03.900
 a plate and I almost break it 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.900
 let's put some spinach 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.370
 in the vinaigrette and we will mix it 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.139
 so that it is direct to the vinaigrette 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.510
 we need is this are fatty acids 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.190
 that we are going to use to take away that 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.110
 cholesterol above that nobody guys 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.300
 cholesterol 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.180
 to get that cholesterol off of us 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.930
 that nobody wants 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.190
 thank you very much I'm going to tell you the fat 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.410
 it is necessary for the operation 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.340
 brain is necessary for the 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:40.550
 functioning of all the muscles of 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.590
 everything is now yes that is what we 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.270
 that keeps us energized we have to 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.200
 take it from here we will put some 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.870
 Apple 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.610
 green apple with all the red green 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.800
 yellow the one you want with everything 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.160
 and shell so they do not rust 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.590
 I recommend a little bit of this lemon or 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.340
 milk to that we will also put a 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.340
 little goat cheese 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:08.999
 you already feel screechy very well and this 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:12.449
 we are going to add our mushrooms 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:15.919
 which are so the product of 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.239
 hot star protein products and 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:22.739
 hot and we're going to make a game of 

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:26.869
 warm the warm cold so that in the mouth 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:31.049

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:33.929

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:35.369
 easy and is this is the good cabin 

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:38.969

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:43.580
