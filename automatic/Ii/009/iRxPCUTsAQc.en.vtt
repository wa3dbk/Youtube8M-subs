00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.730
 in the oven so I'm going to show you now how do they proceed 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.620
 so as you explained you have two points a small and large 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.509
 water that we will ask as you see 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.709
 the manometer on 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.220
 the little one in order to look at the group this trouble and guy is planting there as one can 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.970
 to find it below the blue zone, that is to say there actually a 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.399
 problem of gas so we remove the manometer at first 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.629
 then we open the ball very important to power I would say put the 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:32.910
 bottle to fill 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.590
 put the gas refill so we pull it to the end with respect to the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.560
 turf problem but so the gas bottle 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.260
 we give a small check 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 then we said 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.250
 slowly 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880
 from the moment we run flaesch 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.500
 e a small rear train then 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 we put back 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.230
 before that on ko the manometer is well fixed 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.440
 that's what we can see also a lot of stables 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 then we lose the can 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 the gas then went on so we do not lose it at the chips exchange 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.120
 and from the moment 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 or that the bottle losses could go to the end as one could 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.900
 believe at that time 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.440
 we will start ap unscrewed 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.220
 for the gas since it passed quietly and as you will 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.410
 see so the stable starts to move the gas is coming in and 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.530
 the recharge of 445 be made 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 so we completely empty the bottle 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.400
 until the end 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 so you always see that the stable is moving 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 we wait for the bottle to empty 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 so there you always see the left executive 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.650
 so the refill is being done properly there is no problem 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.580
 alas cook them six years the 40 which is actually the hall the dose 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.550
 perfect 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.670
 then 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 remove the manometer 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.210
 the bottle is free and we just remove the bottle and here is your 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 shoe size is simply sought in gas hochart I pardon in gas lo
