get all this out of the way and focus on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.520 
get all this out of the way and focus on
the<00:02:17.970> screen<00:02:18.209> protector<00:02:18.330> itself<00:02:19.140> which<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the screen protector itself which is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.290 
the screen protector itself which is
right<00:02:19.709> here<00:02:20.220> I'm<00:02:20.640> gonna<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
right here I'm gonna get it out of the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.120 
right here I'm gonna get it out of the
packaging<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.900> first<00:02:22.200> show<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
packaging and first show you the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.699 
packaging and first show you the
thickness<00:02:23.430> again<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.450> measures<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.020> at<00:02:25.200> point

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
thickness again it measures in at point

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.000 
thickness again it measures in at point
12<00:02:26.250> millimeters<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.630> remarkably<00:02:28.380> thin<00:02:28.739> for

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
12 millimeters it's remarkably thin for

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.130 
12 millimeters it's remarkably thin for
a<00:02:29.069> glass<00:02:29.310> screen<00:02:29.550> protector<00:02:30.150> honestly<00:02:30.989> it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
a glass screen protector honestly it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.870 
a glass screen protector honestly it
doesn't<00:02:31.470> feel<00:02:31.650> much<00:02:31.980> thicker<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.489> good

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
doesn't feel much thicker than a good

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.820 
doesn't feel much thicker than a good
quality<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:34.019> regular<00:02:34.290> screen

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
quality you know regular screen

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.650 
quality you know regular screen
protector<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.280> you're<00:02:35.519> used<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.910> except

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
protector that you're used to except

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.449 
protector that you're used to except
this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.989> made<00:02:37.170> from<00:02:37.500> tempered<00:02:37.739> glass<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
this is made from tempered glass so that

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.240 
this is made from tempered glass so that
means<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.910> hardness<00:02:39.390> rating<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:40.220> 8h

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
means it has a hardness rating of 8h

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.000 
means it has a hardness rating of 8h
which<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.300> regular<00:02:43.019> tempered<00:02:43.470> glass<00:02:43.590> ones

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
which the regular tempered glass ones

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.130 
which the regular tempered glass ones
the<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.400> thick<00:02:44.580> ones<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.060> 9h<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.019> you're

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the really thick ones are 9h so you're

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.380 
the really thick ones are 9h so you're
only<00:02:46.319> sacrificing<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.100> tiny<00:02:47.430> bit<00:02:47.790> still

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
only sacrificing a tiny bit still

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
only sacrificing a tiny bit still
getting<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:49.019> shock<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.620> impact

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
getting that good shock and impact

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.070 
getting that good shock and impact
protection<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.700> some<00:02:51.660> oleophobic

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
protection and some oleophobic

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
protection and some oleophobic
properties<00:02:52.920> as<00:02:53.130> well<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:54.330> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
properties as well so that's the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.910 
properties as well so that's the
thickness<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.110> again<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.590> see<00:02:55.769> it's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
thickness and again you can see it's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
thickness and again you can see it's
flexible<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:57.030> move<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> around<00:02:57.720> which

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
flexible so I can move it around which

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.289 
flexible so I can move it around which
really<00:02:58.440> makes<00:02:58.680> installing<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> easier<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
really makes installing it easier and I

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.880 
really makes installing it easier and I
was<00:03:00.450> able<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.750> put<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.110> down<00:03:01.319> using<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
was able to put this down using that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
was able to put this down using that
taco<00:03:02.220> method<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.330> for

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
taco method just like this for

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.530 
taco method just like this for
installation<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.830> let<00:03:05.370> me<00:03:05.459> slide<00:03:05.700> my<00:03:05.880> iPhone<00:03:06.239> 5

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
installation so let me slide my iPhone 5

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.990 
installation so let me slide my iPhone 5
in<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.019> already<00:03:07.380> have<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.739> installed

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
in here I already have this installed

in here I already have this installed
it's<00:03:09.000> gonna<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.330> obviously<00:03:09.690> hard<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.080> make<00:03:10.230> out

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
it's gonna be obviously hard to make out

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.740 
it's gonna be obviously hard to make out
on<00:03:10.410> camera<00:03:11.010> even<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.700> move<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
literally cannot tell there's a screen

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.229 
literally cannot tell there's a screen

there's<00:03:15.620> simply<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.430> no<00:03:17.640> way<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.970> knowing

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
there's simply really no way of knowing

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.840 
there's simply really no way of knowing
the<00:03:18.750> screen<00:03:19.079> feels<00:03:19.410> amazing<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.100> feels<00:03:20.160> just

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
the screen feels amazing it feels just
