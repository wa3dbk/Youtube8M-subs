cream<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.380> well<00:00:38.030> well<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> first

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
cream as well well one of the first

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
cream as well well one of the first
things<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.780> need<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> identify<00:00:40.610> where

things you need to do is identify where
we're<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> install<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.140> new<00:00:43.230> damp

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
we're going to install our new damp

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.790 
we're going to install our new damp
proof<00:00:44.190> course<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.230> basically<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.680> need

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
proof course and basically what we need

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
proof course and basically what we need
to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> outside<00:00:49.050> brick

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to do is that if it's the outside brick

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
to do is that if it's the outside brick
wall<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:50.309> remember<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.149> inject

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
wall because remember that we can inject

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.170 
wall because remember that we can inject
the<00:00:51.930> cream<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.309> single<00:00:53.699> brick<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the cream with it's a single brick or a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
the cream with it's a single brick or a
double<00:00:54.480> brick<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.780> triple<00:00:55.079> brick<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> do

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
double brick or triple brick we can do

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
double brick or triple brick we can do
it<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> cream<00:00:56.910> system<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it from one side of the cream system and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.910 
it from one side of the cream system and
I'll<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.230> further<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
I'll go into that further in just a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.549 
I'll go into that further in just a
moment<00:00:59.250> so<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> outside<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
moment so if it's the outside we want to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.070 
moment so if it's the outside we want to
carp<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> first<00:01:02.370> brick<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.899> want

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
carp about the first brick and we want

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.679 
carp about the first brick and we want
to<00:01:04.140> install<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.339> first<00:01:05.610> mortar<00:01:06.479> line

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to install it in the first mortar line

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
to install it in the first mortar line
here<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.119> need<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> drill

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here now what we do is we need to drill

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
here now what we do is we need to drill
a<00:01:09.869> 12<00:01:10.619> millimeter<00:01:11.070> diameter<00:01:11.310> hole<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a 12 millimeter diameter hole and we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
a 12 millimeter diameter hole and we
need<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.560> every<00:01:13.799> 80<00:01:13.979> Mills<00:01:14.280> apart<00:01:14.670> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
need to do that every 80 Mills apart so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.530 
need to do that every 80 Mills apart so
you<00:01:15.479> need<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> 12<00:01:16.320> millimeter<00:01:16.650> diameter

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
you need a 12 millimeter diameter

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
you need a 12 millimeter diameter
masonry<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> drill<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
masonry bit and you want to drill this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
masonry bit and you want to drill this
hole<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.630> through<00:01:21.750> except<00:01:22.229> for

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hole all the way through except for

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
hole all the way through except for
about<00:01:22.439> 10<00:01:22.799> mil<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.820> 10<00:01:24.030> mil<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
about 10 mil so at about 10 mil off so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.090 
about 10 mil so at about 10 mil off so
you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> measure<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> off<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you want to measure off that off the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
you want to measure off that off the
side<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.520> brick<00:01:26.729> maybe<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
side of a brick maybe you might want to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.359 
side of a brick maybe you might want to
get<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> bit<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.140> tape<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> tape<00:01:28.650> around<00:01:29.130> there

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
get a bit of tape and tape around there

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
get a bit of tape and tape around there
so<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.700> where<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> stop<00:01:30.350> drill<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so you know where to stop drill that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.690 
so you know where to stop drill that
through<00:01:32.540> alright<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.650> works<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.460> about

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
through alright as it works out at about

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
through alright as it works out at about
three<00:01:36.030> holes<00:01:36.329> per<00:01:37.200> brick<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.700> you've

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
three holes per brick and once you've

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
three holes per brick and once you've
done<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> important<00:01:40.140> step<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
done that then the important step is to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.060 
done that then the important step is to
make<00:01:41.189> sure<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.549> vacuum<00:01:42.119> those<00:01:42.810> holes<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.470> now

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
make sure you vacuum those holes out now

of<00:01:53.640> brickwork<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:55.920> now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
of brickwork in the one go all right now

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.270 
of brickwork in the one go all right now
even<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> cavity<00:01:57.840> wall<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:59.040> still

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
even if it's a cavity wall you can still

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.760 
even if it's a cavity wall you can still
do<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.790> way<00:02:00.000> through<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.600> side<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.229> I'll

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
do it this way through one side and I'll

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
do it this way through one side and I'll
show<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.610> drill<00:02:02.850> through<00:02:02.880> both

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
show you as you drill through both

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
show you as you drill through both
courses<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.049> mortar<00:02:04.439> line<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
courses at the mortar line how you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
courses at the mortar line how you
install<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.820> cream<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.390> cavity<00:02:06.780> there

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
install that cream with the cavity there

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.130 
install that cream with the cavity there
but<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.369> our<00:02:08.670> longer

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
but you do that with our longer

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.979 
but you do that with our longer
obviously<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> longer<00:02:10.410> masonry<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.989> once

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
obviously a longer masonry bit once

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.790 
obviously a longer masonry bit once
those<00:02:13.140> holes<00:02:13.349> are<00:02:13.440> drilled

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
those holes are drilled

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
those holes are drilled
need<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> vacuum<00:02:14.220> them<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.600> rid

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
need to vacuum them out when you get rid

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.480 
need to vacuum them out when you get rid
of<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.080> more<00:02:16.410> all<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.070> dust<00:02:17.280> out

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
of all the more all the more to dust out

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.580 
of all the more all the more to dust out
of<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.240> we've<00:02:18.330> got<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.450> clean<00:02:18.870> hole

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of there so that we've got a clean hole

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.460 
of there so that we've got a clean hole
for<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> cream<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:20.820> inserted<00:02:21.270> into<00:02:21.470> when

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
for the cream to be inserted into when

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.100 
for the cream to be inserted into when
you<00:02:22.590> work<00:02:22.860> order<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.550> cartridge<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:24.720> at<00:02:24.870> one

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
you work order your cartridge now at one

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.280 
you work order your cartridge now at one
cartridge<00:02:25.620> will<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> needle<00:02:27.990> meters

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
cartridge will do to the needle meters

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.980 
cartridge will do to the needle meters
of<00:02:28.440> single<00:02:28.830> brickwork<00:02:29.190> or<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.090> will<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.390> half

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
of single brickwork or it will do half

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.540 
of single brickwork or it will do half
at<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.470> double<00:02:31.740> brickwork<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.280> we'll<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.520> one

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
at for double brickwork so we'll do one

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.480 
at for double brickwork so we'll do one
meter<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.990> new<00:02:34.140> meter<00:02:34.410> for<00:02:34.770> double

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
meter one the new meter for double

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.340 
meter one the new meter for double
brickwork<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.840> right<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.140> got<00:02:37.230> your

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
brickwork all right so you got your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.580 
brickwork all right so you got your
cartridge<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.920> get<00:02:38.100> an<00:02:38.820> extension<00:02:39.330> tube<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
cartridge you get an extension tube to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.260 
cartridge you get an extension tube to
do<00:02:40.770> those<00:02:40.950> double<00:02:41.310> britt<00:02:41.490> courses<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.150> you

you're doing is inserting right to the
back<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:48.560> I'll<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.739> move<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:49.980> over

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
back there and I'll just move it over

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.110 
back there and I'll just move it over
there<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.810> do<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.110> we<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.260> start<00:03:52.470> to

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
there what we do is we just start to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.930 
there what we do is we just start to
insert<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.360> cream<00:03:54.870> okay<00:03:55.709> now<00:03:56.670> once<00:03:56.850> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
insert this cream okay now once you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.790 
insert this cream okay now once you
start<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.300> insert<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> cream<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.650> know

start to insert the cream and you know

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.430 
start to insert the cream and you know
it's<00:03:58.980> right<00:03:59.250> at<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.550> back<00:03:59.850> there<00:04:00.350> start<00:04:01.350> to

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
it's right at the back there start to

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.000 
it's right at the back there start to
slowly<00:04:02.420> withdraw<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.480> gun<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.650> muzzle

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
slowly withdraw the gun and the muzzle

slowly withdraw the gun and the muzzle
you<00:04:05.670> can<00:04:05.760> see<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.120> creams<00:04:06.450> coming<00:04:06.720> out<00:04:07.080> and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
you can see that creams coming out and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.470 
you can see that creams coming out and
make<00:04:09.570> sure<00:04:09.600> it's<00:04:09.870> full<00:04:10.940> well<00:04:11.940> it's<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.180> like

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
make sure it's full well it's just like

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.780 
make sure it's full well it's just like
that<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.019> get<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.200> little<00:04:13.320> bit<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.680> run<00:04:14.489> there

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that you get a little bit of run there

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.520 
that you get a little bit of run there
which<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> kay<00:04:15.780> who<00:04:16.140> are<00:04:16.200> all<00:04:16.290> just

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
which is a kay who are all just

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.130 
which is a kay who are all just
absorbing<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> brickwork<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:18.019> then<00:04:19.019> you

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
absorbing to the brickwork and then you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.190 
absorbing to the brickwork and then you
go<00:04:19.290> along<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.040> start<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.090> your<00:04:21.330> second

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
go along and you start to do your second

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.820 
go along and you start to do your second
hole<00:04:22.380> as<00:04:22.650> well

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
hole as well

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.140 
hole as well
after<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> couple<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.370> start<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.730> get<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.880> bit<00:04:27.030> of

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
after a couple you start to get a bit of

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.280 
after a couple you start to get a bit of
an<00:04:27.210> idea<00:04:27.740> how<00:04:28.740> much<00:04:28.980> cream<00:04:29.430> needs<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> go<00:04:30.090> in

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
an idea how much cream needs to go in

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.340 
an idea how much cream needs to go in
just<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.570> just<00:04:33.570> wipe<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.200> off

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
just like that and just wipe it off

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.140 
just like that and just wipe it off
their<00:04:34.650> butter<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:35.100> start<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.790> all<00:04:35.940> just

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
their butter to start it all just

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.050 
their butter to start it all just
penetrates<00:04:36.690> into<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.960> brickwork<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.060> that's

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
penetrates into the brickwork and that's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.790 
penetrates into the brickwork and that's
you<00:04:39.270> go<00:04:39.420> along<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.870> insert<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.260> cream

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
you go along and you insert that cream

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.370 
you go along and you insert that cream
right<00:04:41.220> through<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.790> what<00:04:42.750> happened<00:04:43.230> is

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
right through there what happened is

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.460 
right through there what happened is
that<00:04:43.590> cream<00:04:43.980> will<00:04:44.520> start<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.470> destabilize

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
that cream will start to destabilize

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.740 
that cream will start to destabilize
I'll<00:04:47.280> start<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:47.790> break<00:04:48.060> down<00:04:48.090> into<00:04:48.600> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I'll start to break down into the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.180 
I'll start to break down into the
brickwork<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.350> start<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.710> spread<00:04:49.830> through

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
brickwork and start to spread through

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.480 
brickwork and start to spread through
the<00:04:50.250> mortar<00:04:50.550> line<00:04:50.790> in<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.090> masonry<00:04:51.570> wall<00:04:52.490> you

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
the mortar line in the masonry wall you

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.460 
the mortar line in the masonry wall you
can<00:04:53.610> probably<00:04:53.790> see<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.390> darkening<00:04:54.930> we've

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
can probably see it as a darkening we've

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.020 
can probably see it as a darkening we've
already<00:04:55.590> done<00:04:55.890> Don<00:04:56.070> this<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.400> before<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.970> a

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
already done Don this one before in a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.840 
already done Don this one before in a
previous<00:04:57.060> some<00:04:57.780> demonstration<00:04:58.590> but<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.790> will

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
previous some demonstration but it will

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.520 
previous some demonstration but it will
actually<00:05:00.000> keep<00:05:00.390> taking<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.900> cream<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.350> can

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
actually keep taking the cream you can

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.200 
actually keep taking the cream you can
actually<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:01.920> back<00:05:01.950> time<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.790> time<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.030> time

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
actually go back time and time and time

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.610 
actually go back time and time and time
again<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.630> just<00:05:03.750> keep<00:05:03.840> soaking<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.530> up

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
again and just keep soaking it up

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.220 
again and just keep soaking it up
soaking<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.220> up<00:05:05.310> which<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.210> fantastic<00:05:06.810> so

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
soaking it up which is fantastic so

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.570 
soaking it up which is fantastic so
that's<00:05:07.260> basically<00:05:07.830> gone<00:05:08.040> through<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> width

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
that's basically gone through the width

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.090 
that's basically gone through the width
of<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:09.480> brick<00:05:09.690> wall<00:05:09.720> now<00:05:10.500> obviously<00:05:10.890> if

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
of that that brick wall now obviously if

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.060 
of that that brick wall now obviously if
it<00:05:11.250> was<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.400> double<00:05:12.030> brick<00:05:12.240> wall<00:05:12.690> base<00:05:13.560> what<00:05:13.950> you

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it was a double brick wall base what you

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.980 
it was a double brick wall base what you
do<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.610> would<00:05:15.120> have<00:05:15.240> inserted<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:15.840> all

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
do is you would have inserted that all

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.960 
do is you would have inserted that all
the<00:05:16.080> way<00:05:16.230> through<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.710> double<00:05:16.830> brick<00:05:17.190> if

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
the way through the double brick if

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.790 
the way through the double brick if
there's<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.270> cavity<00:05:18.780> what<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:19.350> might<00:05:19.560> want<00:05:19.740> to

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
there's a cavity what you might want to

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.610 
there's a cavity what you might want to
do<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:21.000> when<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.420> measure<00:05:22.410> off

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
do is that when you get to measure off

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.780 
do is that when you get to measure off
one<00:05:22.890> brick<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.250> I'm<00:05:23.340> going<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.520> put<00:05:23.640> a<00:05:23.670> little

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
one brick and I'm going to put a little

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.210 
one brick and I'm going to put a little
black<00:05:24.390> texture<00:05:24.870> mark<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:25.860> when<00:05:26.100> you're

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
black texture mark so that when you're

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.670 
black texture mark so that when you're
withdrawing<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:27.150> tube<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.290> get<00:05:28.440> to<00:05:28.530> that

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
withdrawing the tube and you get to that

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.770 
withdrawing the tube and you get to that
mark<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.070> know<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.310> just<00:05:29.640> stop<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.540> pressure

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
mark you know to just stop the pressure

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.420 
mark you know to just stop the pressure
a<00:05:30.900> little<00:05:30.990> bit<00:05:31.200> move<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.800> out<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:31.980> bit<00:05:32.100> and<00:05:32.250> then

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
a little bit move it out a bit and then

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.820 
a little bit move it out a bit and then
start<00:05:32.580> again<00:05:32.850> just<00:05:33.030> where<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.510> some<00:05:33.840> cavity

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
start again just where that some cavity

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.690 
start again just where that some cavity
is<00:05:35.900> that's<00:05:36.900> essentially<00:05:37.620> all<00:05:37.830> there<00:05:38.190> is<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.580> it

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
is that's essentially all there is to it

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.500 
is that's essentially all there is to it
it's<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.880> very<00:05:39.090> quick<00:05:39.360> system<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:41.550> it's<00:05:41.850> a<00:05:42.060> very

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
it's a very quick system so it's a very

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.100 
it's a very quick system so it's a very
effective<00:05:42.870> system<00:05:43.230> and<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:45.360> works<00:05:45.690> extremely

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
effective system and it works extremely

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.730 
effective system and it works extremely
well<00:05:46.350> it's<00:05:46.620> stopping<00:05:46.890> rising<00:05:47.880> down<00:05:48.450> now<00:05:49.380> when

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
well it's stopping rising down now when

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.410 
well it's stopping rising down now when
you<00:05:49.830> start<00:05:50.070> getting<00:05:50.220> beyond<00:05:50.730> about<00:05:50.970> six<00:05:51.300> or

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
you start getting beyond about six or

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.020 
you start getting beyond about six or
seven<00:05:51.780> cartridges<00:05:52.380> required<00:05:52.800> for<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.790> wall

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
seven cartridges required for a wall

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.870 
seven cartridges required for a wall
seven<00:05:54.900> meters<00:05:55.260> or<00:05:55.410> so<00:05:55.650> while<00:05:56.250> up<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.580> lineal

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
seven meters or so while up of lineal

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.550 
seven meters or so while up of lineal
meters<00:05:57.180> you're<00:05:57.690> really<00:05:57.960> probably<00:05:58.110> will<00:05:58.440> then

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
meters you're really probably will then

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.810 
meters you're really probably will then
we'll<00:05:58.710> start<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.040> think<00:05:59.250> about<00:05:59.430> whether<00:05:59.580> you

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
we'll start to think about whether you

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.500 
we'll start to think about whether you
use<00:06:00.060> thing<00:06:00.560> five<00:06:01.560> litre<00:06:01.860> tub<00:06:02.400> of<00:06:02.550> cream<00:06:02.730> or<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
use thing five litre tub of cream or the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.740 
use thing five litre tub of cream or the
twenty<00:06:03.870> litre<00:06:04.080> for<00:06:04.920> larger<00:06:05.520> larger<00:06:05.670> jobs<00:06:06.120> the

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
twenty litre for larger larger jobs the

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.650 
twenty litre for larger larger jobs the
five<00:06:07.170> litre<00:06:07.530> will<00:06:08.130> do<00:06:08.310> roughly<00:06:08.880> around<00:06:09.060> 30

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
five litre will do roughly around 30

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.470 
five litre will do roughly around 30
lineal<00:06:10.470> meters<00:06:10.860> okay<00:06:11.550> a<00:06:11.580> single<00:06:12.120> brick<00:06:12.300> work

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
lineal meters okay a single brick work

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.930 
lineal meters okay a single brick work
or<00:06:12.720> it'd<00:06:13.320> be<00:06:13.410> 15<00:06:13.830> meters<00:06:14.010> of<00:06:14.310> double<00:06:14.610> brickwork

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
or it'd be 15 meters of double brickwork

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.450 
or it'd be 15 meters of double brickwork
and<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.900> 21<00:06:16.410> 2011-1<00:06:17.130> that<00:06:17.850> we'll<00:06:17.970> do<00:06:18.120> around

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
and the 21 2011-1 that we'll do around

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.720 
and the 21 2011-1 that we'll do around
120<00:06:20.460> lineal<00:06:21.270> metres<00:06:21.660> and<00:06:22.010> there<00:06:23.010> will<00:06:23.250> be<00:06:23.280> 60

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
120 lineal metres and there will be 60

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.180 
120 lineal metres and there will be 60
metres<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.210> double<00:06:24.810> brickwork<00:06:25.170> and<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:26.040> way

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
metres of double brickwork and the way

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.040 
metres of double brickwork and the way
that<00:06:26.430> that's<00:06:26.610> installed<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.480> we<00:06:27.870> basically

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
that that's installed and we basically

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.160 
that that's installed and we basically
use<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.530> pressure<00:06:29.490> pump<00:06:29.850> system<00:06:30.270> it's<00:06:31.050> like<00:06:31.080> a

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
use a pressure pump system it's like a

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.490 
use a pressure pump system it's like a
weed<00:06:31.470> type<00:06:31.740> sprayer<00:06:32.100> which<00:06:32.340> we<00:06:32.550> we<00:06:32.790> offer<00:06:32.970> to

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
weed type sprayer which we we offer to

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.800 
weed type sprayer which we we offer to
-<00:06:33.590> so<00:06:34.250> with<00:06:34.700> these<00:06:34.910> two<00:06:34.970> probably<00:06:35.390> borrowed

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
- so with these two probably borrowed

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.490 
- so with these two probably borrowed
for<00:06:36.050> you<00:06:36.230> we<00:06:37.040> do<00:06:37.370> a<00:06:37.720> economy<00:06:38.720> one<00:06:38.900> as<00:06:39.140> well<00:06:39.320> as<00:06:39.470> a

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
for you we do a economy one as well as a

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.100 
for you we do a economy one as well as a
pro<00:06:40.070> series<00:06:40.370> one<00:06:40.760> where<00:06:41.480> you're<00:06:41.660> doing<00:06:41.870> a<00:06:41.930> lot

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
pro series one where you're doing a lot

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.180 
pro series one where you're doing a lot
of<00:06:42.140> work<00:06:42.410> when<00:06:42.650> you're<00:06:42.740> doing<00:06:42.950> a<00:06:43.010> lot<00:06:43.160> of

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
of work when you're doing a lot of

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.820 
of work when you're doing a lot of
repetitive<00:06:43.550> work<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.320> will<00:06:45.320> show<00:06:45.500> another

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
repetitive work and will show another

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.100 
repetitive work and will show another
video<00:06:46.220> on<00:06:46.310> how<00:06:46.430> that<00:06:46.760> works<00:06:47.000> as<00:06:47.270> well<00:06:47.840> but

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
video on how that works as well but

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.470 
video on how that works as well but
that's<00:06:48.470> a<00:06:48.650> basic<00:06:48.950> demonstration<00:06:49.100> of<00:06:49.790> how<00:06:49.970> the

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
that's a basic demonstration of how the

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.670 
that's a basic demonstration of how the
protector<00:06:51.110> a<00:06:51.250> DPC<00:06:52.250> creme<00:06:52.610> system<00:06:53.060> works<00:06:53.270> and

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
protector a DPC creme system works and

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.800 
protector a DPC creme system works and
done<00:06:54.680> how<00:06:54.980> you<00:06:55.040> can<00:06:55.220> install<00:06:55.370> a<00:06:56.270> new

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
done how you can install a new

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.230 
done how you can install a new
damp-proof<00:06:57.380> course<00:06:57.410> and<00:06:57.980> stop<00:06:58.550> that<00:06:58.760> rising
