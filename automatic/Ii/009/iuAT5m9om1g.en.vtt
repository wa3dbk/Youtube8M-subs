00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 Good people, I'm going to teach you today. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.070
 there's how to update the drivers 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.970
 right computer is this procedure that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's do it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 works on windows xp windows vista 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.740
 windows 7 windows 8 and 8 point ie 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 and all versions of windows is good 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 there are two procedures you see 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.840
 what can we do to update the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 the first and it would be with the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 windows update for this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.730
 come on it's on my computer now 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 that my computer 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 let's go in properties manager 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.399
 devices toward devices 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 show you there all the drivers of the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 your right computer 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.250
 I usually analyze this team. 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 Personally serving way I'll show 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.770
 for you 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 then another method but I usually 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 use this method here that would be you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.740
 update there one by one of your 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.119
 drivers and you will click here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 for example in the driver update video and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 the system itself will look at the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.580
 internet an updated dragon video 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.990
 for you right 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.700
 reminding you have to be in 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 constant is disconnected 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 You will click here he will search 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 on an updated drive if this drive 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140
 it is out of date if it is 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 is automatically the outdated 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.280
 system will start downloading after having 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.409
 identified the drive will start to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.810
 download and will open the installer for you 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.740
 is installing this you will have to do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 on all drives that are right here 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.490
 he will research there 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.590
 if you start to download this 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.730
 drive here I stopped being updated 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.730
 to show you 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.460
 started downloading here you can see 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 I canceled because I'm going to show 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.330
 for you another method but you can 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 do this here in every other 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.960
 drivers right in case here it is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.610
 I'll show you when 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.260
 driver is already up-to- date what the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.510
 windows will tell you is in this case 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.300
 this drive is up to date 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.310
 He will search but will not find 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.310
 a more up-to-date driver than this 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.230
 then this message will appear to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.360
 you 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.670
 the driver for the device is already 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.980
 installed or is the most updated there 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.840
 so you can do it there 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 in all these drivers here from your 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.330

 use this method here which is more 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.850
 efficient is uncertain 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.100
