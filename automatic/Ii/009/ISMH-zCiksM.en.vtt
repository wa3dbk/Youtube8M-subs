00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sanding but before we get started I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.269 
sanding but before we get started I
wanted<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> address<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.199> couple<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.710> questions

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
wanted to address a couple of questions

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.720 
wanted to address a couple of questions
I<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:21.180> super<00:00:21.990> smart<00:00:22.410> painting<00:00:23.010> friends<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I have super smart painting friends and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
I have super smart painting friends and
they<00:00:24.119> asked<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.539> questions<00:00:24.600> last<00:00:25.140> night

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
they asked these questions last night

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.140 
they asked these questions last night
and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.769> thought<00:00:25.980> okay<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> should<00:00:27.060> have

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and I thought okay I should have

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
and I thought okay I should have
addressed<00:00:27.359> those<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> first<00:00:28.140> video<00:00:28.680> but

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
addressed those in the first video but

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
addressed those in the first video but
better<00:00:29.849> late<00:00:30.269> than<00:00:30.660> never

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
better late than never

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
better late than never
so<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.160> great<00:00:32.399> questions<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.840> first

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so they're great questions and the first

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.280 
so they're great questions and the first
one<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.399> bondo<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.059> used<00:00:36.420> over<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> surface

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
one was can bondo be used over a surface

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
one was can bondo be used over a surface
other<00:00:37.710> than<00:00:38.250> solid<00:00:38.730> wood<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.870> answer<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
other than solid wood and the answer is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
other than solid wood and the answer is
yes<00:00:41.690> bondo<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.379> designed<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
yes bondo is actually designed to be

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.600 
yes bondo is actually designed to be
used<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:45.020> metal<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> vehicle<00:00:47.010> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
used over metal like for a vehicle so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
used over metal like for a vehicle so
it's<00:00:47.820> made<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.390> slick<00:00:48.719> surface<00:00:49.230> I've<00:00:49.500> used<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
it's made for slick surface I've used it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's made for slick surface I've used it
over<00:00:50.520> particleboard<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.719> used<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.440> MDF

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
over particleboard I've used it over MDF

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
over particleboard I've used it over MDF
so<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.210> certainly<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.289> any<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so you can certainly use it over any of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
so you can certainly use it over any of
those<00:00:56.160> surfaces<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.690> second<00:00:58.109> question

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
those surfaces and the second question

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
those surfaces and the second question
was<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.489> prefer<00:00:59.820> bondo<00:01:00.239> over<00:01:00.719> wood

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
was why do you prefer bondo over wood

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170 
was why do you prefer bondo over wood
filler<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.500> there's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.309> couple<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.940> reasons

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
filler and there's a couple of reasons

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
filler and there's a couple of reasons
the<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> I've<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> couple<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the first is that I've had a couple of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
the first is that I've had a couple of
rotten<00:01:05.430> experiences<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.390> wood<00:01:06.600> filler<00:01:06.840> I've

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
rotten experiences with wood filler I've

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310 
rotten experiences with wood filler I've
filled<00:01:07.710> large<00:01:08.130> areas<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:09.030> areas<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.689> after

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
filled large areas small areas and after

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
filled large areas small areas and after
I've<00:01:10.680> completed<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.490> piece<00:01:11.700> I've<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
I've completed the piece I've had it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.960 
I've completed the piece I've had it
crack<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.960> me<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.290> fall<00:01:13.560> out<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.549> absolutely

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
crack on me or fall out and I absolutely

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
crack on me or fall out and I absolutely
hate<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> go<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> redo<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
hate to have to go back and redo a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.330 
hate to have to go back and redo a
project<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> stinks<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.290> once<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.189> found

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
project that stinks so once I found

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
project that stinks so once I found
bondo<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> started<00:01:21.420> using<00:01:21.540> bondo<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.170> never

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
bondo and started using bondo I never

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.960 
bondo and started using bondo I never
had<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> happen<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.490> I've<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.610> never

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
had that happen so I've just never

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.420 
had that happen so I've just never
looked<00:01:24.240> back

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
looked back

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
looked back
the<00:01:26.430> second<00:01:26.790> reason<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.210> prefer<00:01:27.360> bondo<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.170> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the second reason I prefer bondo is that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
the second reason I prefer bondo is that
it<00:01:28.829> doesn't<00:01:29.220> absorb<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> paint<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.630> wood

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it doesn't absorb the paint like wood

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.160 
it doesn't absorb the paint like wood
filler<00:01:31.350> does<00:01:31.650> wood<00:01:32.130> filler<00:01:32.750> absorb<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> paint

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
filler does wood filler absorb the paint

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
filler does wood filler absorb the paint
and<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.759> differently<00:01:35.759> than<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> veneer

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and so differently than the veneer

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.280 
and so differently than the veneer
around<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
around it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.310 
around it
so<00:01:37.560> once<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.159> paint<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> dry<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.960> sometimes

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
so once your paint is dry and sometimes

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.719 
so once your paint is dry and sometimes
the<00:01:40.829> paint<00:01:41.100> won't<00:01:41.220> even<00:01:41.460> look<00:01:41.520> different

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the paint won't even look different

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.429 
the paint won't even look different
sometimes<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> doesn't<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> inconsistency

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
sometimes it doesn't the inconsistency

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.950 
sometimes it doesn't the inconsistency
doesn't<00:01:44.220> show<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.579> until<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.149> wax<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.720> seal

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
doesn't show up until you wax it or seal

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
doesn't show up until you wax it or seal
it<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.799> I've<00:01:47.009> always<00:01:47.369> found<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> looks

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it but I've always found that it looks

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.170 
it but I've always found that it looks
different<00:01:48.869> drives<00:01:49.439> me<00:01:49.649> nuts<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.610> don't<00:01:51.000> have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
different drives me nuts so I don't have

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200 
different drives me nuts so I don't have
that<00:01:51.240> problem<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.990> bondo<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> third<00:01:53.820> reason

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that problem with bondo the third reason

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.230 
that problem with bondo the third reason
is<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.000> able<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is that I really like to be able to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.859 
is that I really like to be able to
manipulate<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.110> products<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.149> add<00:02:00.360> more

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
manipulate my products you can add more
