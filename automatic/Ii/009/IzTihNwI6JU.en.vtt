dancing with these holographic shoes
that<00:02:21.620> are<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.940> don't<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.450> how<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.630> explain

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
that are so I don't know how to explain

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.270 
that are so I don't know how to explain
that<00:02:23.959> show<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.410> feeling<00:02:24.709> thing<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.010> did

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that show the feeling thing I just did

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.190 
that show the feeling thing I just did
but<00:02:25.580> let's<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.600> pretend<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.020> never

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
but let's just pretend that never

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:38.740 
but let's just pretend that never
happened<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:38.150> one's<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.570> like<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
happened so this one's kind of like a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.050 
happened so this one's kind of like a
do-it-yourself<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.800> Tumblr<00:02:40.220> dashboard<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
do-it-yourself a Tumblr dashboard and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.080 
do-it-yourself a Tumblr dashboard and
not<00:02:41.209> kohake<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.040> took<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.370> ton<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.670> images

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
not kohake so I took a ton of images

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.460 
not kohake so I took a ton of images
that<00:02:44.120> were<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.570> related<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.110> ton<00:02:45.440> of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
that were just related to a ton of
fandoms<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.940> threw<00:02:47.420> them<00:02:47.570> on

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
fandoms that I like and threw them on

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.990 
fandoms that I like and threw them on
t-shirt<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.410> at<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> bottom<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.220> wrote<00:02:49.400> fandom

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
t-shirt and at the bottom I wrote fandom

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.150 
t-shirt and at the bottom I wrote fandom
mating<00:02:50.480> cold<00:02:50.720> because<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.739> see<00:02:51.950> someone

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
mating cold because if I see someone

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.190 
mating cold because if I see someone
with<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> t-shirt<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> band<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.810> leg<00:02:53.989> I'm

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
with a t-shirt with a band on my leg I'm

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
with a t-shirt with a band on my leg I'm
gonna<00:02:54.350> say<00:02:54.650> something

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
gonna say something

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.790 
gonna say something
so<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> mating<00:02:56.780> call<00:02:56.930> for<00:02:57.380> people<00:02:57.680> in

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.380 
so it's like a mating call for people in
fandom<00:02:58.190> see<00:02:58.489> see<00:02:58.760> what<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.910> did<00:02:59.030> there

it's<00:03:46.859> like<00:03:47.040> describing<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.909> entire<00:03:48.180> plot

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
it's like describing the entire plot

00:03:48.480 --> 00:04:12.339 
it's like describing the entire plot
with<00:03:48.840> emoji

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.760 

this<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.770> some<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.580> intense<00:04:13.940> music<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.739> I

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
this is some really intense music so I

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.680 
this is some really intense music so I
actually<00:04:16.040> tie-dyed<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.760> white<00:04:17.030> t-shirt<00:04:17.269> dress

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
actually tie-dyed a white t-shirt dress

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.120 
actually tie-dyed a white t-shirt dress
which<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:17.989> totally<00:04:18.290> optional<00:04:18.440> but<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.859> thought

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
which is totally optional but I thought

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.240 
which is totally optional but I thought
it<00:04:19.310> looks<00:04:19.489> just<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:19.940> much<00:04:20.150> cooler<00:04:21.250> I'm

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
it looks just so much cooler I'm

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.560 
it looks just so much cooler I'm
seriously<00:04:22.760> upset<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.210> what's<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.480> my

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
seriously upset that what's on my

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.890 
seriously upset that what's on my
t-shirt<00:04:23.780> isn't<00:04:24.410> true<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:26.360> copied<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
t-shirt isn't true so I copied and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
t-shirt isn't true so I copied and
pasted<00:04:27.200> at<00:04:27.380> this<00:04:27.500> picture<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.980> these<00:04:28.100> at<00:04:28.340> cool

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
pasted at this picture of these at cool

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.220 
pasted at this picture of these at cool
and<00:04:28.820> trendy<00:04:28.910> lips<00:04:29.389> because<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.750> thought<00:04:30.050> that

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
and trendy lips because I thought that

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.020 
and trendy lips because I thought that
they<00:04:30.350> match<00:04:30.620> with<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.919> theme<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.430> then<00:04:31.700> in

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
they match with the theme and then in

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.940 
they match with the theme and then in
this<00:04:32.180> font<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.050> put<00:04:33.260> on<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.440> screen<00:04:33.740> I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
this font that I put on the screen I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.379 
this font that I put on the screen I
decided<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.550> put<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.760> lips<00:04:34.910> in<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.150> sleeves

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
decided to put the lips in the sleeves

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.120 
decided to put the lips in the sleeves
because<00:04:35.540> they<00:04:35.780> looked<00:04:35.960> cooler<00:04:36.320> their<00:04:36.530> answer

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
because they looked cooler their answer

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.409 
because they looked cooler their answer
that<00:04:37.250> they<00:04:37.340> went<00:04:37.520> distract<00:04:37.850> from<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.090> text

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
that they went distract from the text

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:53.080 
that they went distract from the text
because<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.690> must<00:04:39.050> convey<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.650> message

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.490 

again<00:04:54.090> how<00:04:54.240> do<00:04:54.300> wear<00:04:54.480> glasses<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.990> just<00:04:55.170> decided

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
again how do wear glasses I just decided

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.020 
again how do wear glasses I just decided
to<00:04:55.590> wear<00:04:55.770> them<00:04:55.920> because<00:04:56.040> they<00:04:56.340> made<00:04:56.610> me<00:04:56.640> feel
