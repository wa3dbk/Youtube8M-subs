00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.860
 very good files how are you today 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.820
 I bring you a news about a new 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.200
 game mode that they will implement 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.780
 since for me for this 2015 product and 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.209
 us that is what they call control of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.829
 mistakes I comment because I think that 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.210
 they said it a few weeks ago or 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.460
 a few days I do not know very well exactly 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.929
 but nothing but the truth that I do not 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.009
 I had seen before and how I just saw it 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.919
 now and it seems to me a game mode 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.499
 quite revolutionary I bring you a 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.239
 video so you know not and well this 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.940
 Game mode is a game mode 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.489
 online and it's based on what they're going to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.379
 divide the field into three sections worth 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.210
 what is the defense section the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.710
 description of the midfield and the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.750
 exception of the front 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 then imagine that we play with 433 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.230
 of alignment is worth the most 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.270
 compensated let's say for this mode of 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.270
 game 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 and we like to defend 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.780
 imagine that we are defenses 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.060
 we like this facet of the field and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.000
 we want to defend it is worth 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.580
 we played a game a match online and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 in the horns with three three friends three 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.750
 Our allies do not have to be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.250
 friends I logically imagine that there will still be 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 a way to play randomly with 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.340
 people from all over the world but when with 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 3-3 on one team and three on your team 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 those three each will choose an area of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.910
 field one will be ahead of us in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 defense then the midfielder the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.660
 that they choose the defense for example 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 imagine you control the plants and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.540
 lateral ones that choose midfield 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.270
 controls all midfielders who 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.070
 there in that place and field travels 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.410
 front he will play with all 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 front ends etc. then to 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.590
 I find it quite revolutionary 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 because it's a game mode where you do not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.149
 we count a player if we do not count 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 several but on one side of the field alone 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.030
 about an egg facet then this 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.040
 please go help us 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 we have to improve our play of 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280
 team because you can imagine that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.870
 I'm playing with a defender and I get 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 to run like crazy in front 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
 to the empty defense and the forward 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 example has to go down to defend or the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.520
 midfielder does not help in a lot 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.080
 equal in team and the truth to me 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
 excuse this online mode illusion 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.450
 Pretty because I see her 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.950
 revolutionaries especially that has not 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.720
 done nobody still do not know the fifa by 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 example does not usually have the pro 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 how many years are behind in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 how much online about sex because 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.610
 fifa in online mode is brutal is what 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.070
 better than you have then you usually trust 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.860
 quite economy that is fifa but 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.420
 in this case with friend in united the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.040
 office to have gathered that in this 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.530
 year has given you this idea we are going to 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.730
 divide the field into three fractions ones 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 What is the defender? 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.220
 midfield with front axle mode 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.690
 online three against three and the truth is very 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.250
 good looking this game mode to me 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 He liked me quite enough has 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 liked and nothing will have to prove it see 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 how does it work to see how it's going to look 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.680
 if it meets the expectations at the moment 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.870
 good good game modes that are 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.640
 announcing for konami from the bonus to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.740
 my forgiveness and nothing we will see to see how 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.570
 How are you doing? How are you going? 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.730
 that if this ends up liking people if 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.910
 does not end up liking yes yes is what 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.160
 we wait 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.570
 for the moment I like the truth has 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 one half of the game let's see how 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.220
 reacts to our commands and if the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.810
 lag and if the servers work 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.550
 well they are of course the key 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.070
 to be able to enjoy a good way 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.300
 online until the next guys see you guys 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.300
 in the next video chao
