platinum edition now this one here is
high<00:00:21.570> performance<00:00:22.170> Ram<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.920> if<00:00:23.010> you're

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
high performance Ram so if you're

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
high performance Ram so if you're
looking<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.400> four<00:00:23.789> gigabytes<00:00:24.510> kit<00:00:24.990> as

looking for four gigabytes kit as

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
looking for four gigabytes kit as
opposed<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.859> gigabyte<00:00:26.340> kit<00:00:26.640> from

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
opposed to two gigabyte kit from

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
opposed to two gigabyte kit from
somewhere<00:00:27.210> else<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.619> might<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> for

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
somewhere else well this might be it for

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.150 
somewhere else well this might be it for
you<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.760> made<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.660> AMD<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.830> low

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you it's made for AMD it's got low

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.000 
you it's made for AMD it's got low
voltage<00:00:32.669> 1.65<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.110> overclock<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
voltage 1.65 so you can overclock it and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
voltage 1.65 so you can overclock it and
the<00:00:35.820> default<00:00:36.210> timing<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> 777<00:00:37.649> 24<00:00:38.520> okay<00:00:39.120> rated

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the default timing is 777 24 okay rated

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770 
the default timing is 777 24 okay rated
at<00:00:39.840> 1600<00:00:40.620> megahertz<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.270> highest

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
at 1600 megahertz that's the the highest

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.580 
at 1600 megahertz that's the the highest
that<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> rate<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.899> heat

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that you can rate there and the heat

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.840 
that you can rate there and the heat
spreader<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.219> using<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.700> course

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
spreader that it's using is of course

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
spreader that it's using is of course
that<00:00:48.090> platinum<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.460> heat<00:00:50.460> spreader<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that platinum a heat spreader that it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.709 
that platinum a heat spreader that it's
got<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> xt<00:00:51.960> z<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> honeycomb

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
got the xt z and it's got the honeycomb

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.380 
got the xt z and it's got the honeycomb
holes<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.620> across<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.219> dissipate<00:00:56.760> heat<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
holes going across to dissipate heat so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
holes going across to dissipate heat so
that's<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.809> nice<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.260> keeps<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> nice<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that's very nice so it keeps it nice and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
that's very nice so it keeps it nice and
cool<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.940> thing<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.420> about<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
cool one thing that I like about it is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.479 
cool one thing that I like about it is
that<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.230> doesn't<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.739> large<00:01:02.039> heat

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that it doesn't have these large heat

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.939 
that it doesn't have these large heat
sinks<00:01:02.850> necessarily<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> test

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
sinks necessarily so if you have a test

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
sinks necessarily so if you have a test
system<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> using<00:01:06.060> today

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
system like the one that I'm using today

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.960 
system like the one that I'm using today
that<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> latest<00:01:07.970> coolermaster

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that is using the latest coolermaster

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.390 
that is using the latest coolermaster
v10<00:01:09.570> cpu<00:01:10.080> cooler<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> lot<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
v10 cpu cooler there's not a lot of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
v10 cpu cooler there's not a lot of
space<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.060> between<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.869> RAM<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
space there between the RAM and the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
space there between the RAM and the
cooler<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.340> fit<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.729> perfectly<00:01:15.299> with

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
cooler so this fit in perfectly with

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.679 
cooler so this fit in perfectly with
lots<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> air<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.830> spare<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
lots of air to spare on there so this is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
lots of air to spare on there so this is
the<00:01:18.900> system<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.799> i'm<00:01:19.890> running

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the system as you can see i'm running

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.850 
the system as you can see i'm running

my<00:01:27.869> other<00:01:28.049> video<00:01:28.409> reviews<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.549> system

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
my other video reviews so this system

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
my other video reviews so this system
here<00:01:30.180> i'm<00:01:30.329> also<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> compare<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
here i'm also going to compare it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.550 
here i'm also going to compare it
against<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> 2<00:01:32.070> gigabyte<00:01:32.490> kit<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:33.630> king

gigahertz for the cpu the the phenom 2
and<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.920> memory<00:01:50.310> clock<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:51.290> 1333

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and the memory clock is at about 1333

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.319 
and the memory clock is at about 1333
that's<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> had<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> stable<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.240> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that's what I had it stable and then I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's what I had it stable and then I
went<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.229> increase<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> voltage<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
went in and I increase the voltage just

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.270 
went in and I increase the voltage just
a<00:01:56.250> teeny<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:56.969> 1.65<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.200> 1.7<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> then

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
a teeny bit from 1.65 to 1.7 and then

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
a teeny bit from 1.65 to 1.7 and then
went<00:01:59.520> into<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> drm<00:02:00.210> configuration<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
went into the drm configuration and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
went into the drm configuration and
manually<00:02:01.799> set<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> timings<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.990> suggested<00:02:03.990> by

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
manually set the timings as suggested by

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.660 
manually set the timings as suggested by
the<00:02:04.140> manufacturer<00:02:05.420> 2777<00:02:06.420> 24<00:02:07.259> right<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.459> those

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the manufacturer 2777 24 right so those

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
the manufacturer 2777 24 right so those
are<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.060> manual<00:02:09.629> settings<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.170> i<00:02:10.200> went<00:02:10.440> in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
are the manual settings that i went in

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.460 
are the manual settings that i went in
and<00:02:10.709> i<00:02:11.069> change<00:02:11.459> them

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
and i change them

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.500 
and i change them
and<00:02:12.560> anybody<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.520> say<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:13.880> let's<00:02:14.360> just

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
and anybody can just say well let's just

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
and anybody can just say well let's just
increase<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.110> make<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:15.980> overclocked<00:02:16.670> and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
increase and make this overclocked and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.950 
increase and make this overclocked and
hey<00:02:17.840> look<00:02:18.530> at<00:02:18.710> my<00:02:18.800> settings<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.870> doesn't<00:02:20.870> mean

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
hey look at my settings but doesn't mean

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.690 
hey look at my settings but doesn't mean
that<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.200> stable<00:02:21.560> right<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.160> key<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.430> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that it's stable right the key here is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.120 
that it's stable right the key here is
to<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.210> work<00:02:23.870> stable<00:02:24.470> for<00:02:24.620> hours<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
to get it to work stable for hours and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.990 
to get it to work stable for hours and
not<00:02:25.220> crash<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.060> right<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:28.490> is<00:02:28.790> what

not crash on you right so this is what
I've<00:02:29.120> got<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.630> ran<00:02:29.870> stable<00:02:30.530> right<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.280> for

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
I've got that ran stable right so for

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.160 
I've got that ran stable right so for
those<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.270> are<00:02:32.390> wondering<00:02:32.720> oh<00:02:32.840> well

those of you that are wondering oh well
I'm<00:02:33.560> underclocking<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.460> or<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:34.670> overclocking

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I'm underclocking it or I'm overclocking

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.060 
I'm underclocking it or I'm overclocking
it<00:02:35.510> or<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.080> would<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.620> done<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.950> differently

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it or you would have done it differently

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.010 
it or you would have done it differently
well<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:37.940> depends<00:02:38.330> on<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> system<00:02:38.690> not

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
well it depends on the system not

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.420 
well it depends on the system not
everybody<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.530> get<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.800> same<00:02:40.010> settings

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
everybody can get the same settings

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.030 
everybody can get the same settings
right<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.080> depends<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.260> configuration

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
right and depends on your configuration

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.480 
right and depends on your configuration
when<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.670> stress<00:02:44.000> test<00:02:44.330> things<00:02:45.490> everybody

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
when you stress test things everybody

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.070 
when you stress test things everybody
has<00:02:46.670> slightly<00:02:46.910> different<00:02:47.330> settings<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:48.050> I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
has slightly different settings but I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.890 
has slightly different settings but I
went<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.770> OCC<00:02:49.250> forum<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.790> read<00:02:50.270> around

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
went on to the OCC forum I read around

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.810 
went on to the OCC forum I read around
to<00:02:51.110> see<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.380> other<00:02:51.470> people<00:02:51.830> had<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.670> is

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to see what other people had and this is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.930 
to see what other people had and this is
basically<00:02:53.180> what<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.750> agree<00:02:54.530> came<00:02:55.130> stable<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.760> my

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
basically what I agree came stable on my

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.000 
basically what I agree came stable on my
system<00:02:56.360> after<00:02:56.540> writing<00:02:56.930> stress<00:02:57.320> tests<00:02:57.620> on<00:02:57.830> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
system after writing stress tests on it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.090 
system after writing stress tests on it
ok<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.240> again<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.750> through<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.410> cpu<00:03:00.830> z

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
ok so again going through the cpu z

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.130 
ok so again going through the cpu z

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
vantage score was 16 505 a little bit

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.650 
vantage score was 16 505 a little bit
higher<00:03:34.130> than<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.400> kingston<00:03:34.880> which<00:03:35.390> was

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
higher than the kingston which was

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.509 
higher than the kingston which was
running<00:03:35.900> at<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.050> higher<00:03:36.290> speed<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.280> there<00:03:37.430> you

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
running at a higher speed so there you

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.100 
running at a higher speed so there you
go<00:03:37.550> of<00:03:38.090> course<00:03:38.360> they're<00:03:38.540> both<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> same<00:03:38.900> price

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
go of course they're both the same price

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.470 
go of course they're both the same price
just<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.800> know<00:03:39.950> roughly<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:41.030> were<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.330> buy

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
just so you know roughly you were to buy

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.449 
just so you know roughly you were to buy
these<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.110> do<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.320> want<00:03:42.470> before<00:03:42.620> gigabyte<00:03:43.220> kit

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
these so do you want before gigabyte kit

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.420 
these so do you want before gigabyte kit
or<00:03:43.760> two<00:03:44.030> gigabyte<00:03:44.420> kit<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.290> that's<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.310> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
or two gigabyte kit so that's up to you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.720 
or two gigabyte kit so that's up to you
and<00:03:46.640> here's<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.330> 3dmark<00:03:47.660> 06<00:03:48.190> score<00:03:49.190> again

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
and here's the 3dmark 06 score again

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.610 
and here's the 3dmark 06 score again
comparing<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.420> something<00:03:50.750> close<00:03:51.350> and

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
comparing it to something close and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.680 
comparing it to something close and
performance<00:03:52.580> right<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.420> don't<00:03:53.570> necessarily

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
performance right you don't necessarily

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.640 
performance right you don't necessarily
have<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.680> exact<00:03:55.010> same<00:03:55.510> Ram<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:57.230> prove

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
have to have the exact same Ram to prove

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.890 
have to have the exact same Ram to prove
that<00:03:57.680> things<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:58.489> comparable<00:03:59.060> right<00:03:59.570> so<00:03:59.780> that

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900
