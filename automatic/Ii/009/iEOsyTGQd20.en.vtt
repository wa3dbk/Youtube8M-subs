00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 good kids because here I bring you a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.560
 new boxing as you can see and to whom 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.990
 know is the new iPhone 6 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 in this case it is the little one excludes us 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 since he has tired a little of the mobile 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.619
 big because he was with the nou 2 from 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 two years ago and it's a mobile too 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.140
 big 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.190
 at the beginning and whistle that well but then 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 already the trousers are already beginning to weigh and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.810
 had his phone a little smaller and already 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.560
 He had long been waiting for some cases in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.590
 conditions and look 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.989
 I bought this so nothing will 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.110
 put the unboxing this is the one of 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.690
 6GB capacity worth some can 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 think that it is little but it does not make me 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.640
 is missing more since usually it always 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.920
 I'm emptying every time because I do not 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.649
 I like to have a cell phone full of shit 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.199
 and nothing I put little movies and nothing of 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.379
 this knows if and for music few times 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 I use it so nothing that turns 16 is going 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.140
 that neither painted 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 ok I do not know how I'm going to open it with this 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.210
 because it is too narrow 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:14.530
 and I dont know 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.530
 You let us come a cutter is better 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.070
 I would not like to load the box too much 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.510
 since I keep it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.250
 to see 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.250
 that is, cut 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.020
 so you can go home 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.510
 and nothing we are going to do a boxing only 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.960
 you know let's teach him a little and that 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.479
 I have a channel to use it 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.610
 it has come to me now in the morning that I 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.830
 I just woke up but all the surprise 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.840
 and I'm still a little asleep 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.330
 as you can see in the box then nothing 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.550
 you just do not come iphone photos alone 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.270
 It has a small relief 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.890
 this was so as not to spend safe ink and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.210
 good the ones you put iphone with the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.800
 manzanita and all the trouble this 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.320
 so nothing we are going to open 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:22.350
 if you want that was this effect here 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.470
 empty good 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.600
 and I hope that I do not drop my eye lame 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.900
 to more than one that happens to the videos 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.099
 these 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.099
 and here we have it 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970
 here 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.560
 and sometimes but you do not get reflected because 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.560
 I 'm not here to be reflected now 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.340
 my mother 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.340
 how nice 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.239
 the truth is that it is a pass 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.819
 yes I already know that those who go to look there are 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.200
 here before the phone I pass to a 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.500
 letting ourselves out of nonsense what matters in 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.290
 the phone 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.140
 it's a pass 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 super delgadito 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.330
 well come on let's go look at the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.330
 things 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.570
 that we have here typical tray of 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.570
 Manzana 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.050
 And here 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.090
 then nothing typical instructions in 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.350
 different languages effectively these 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.069
 they are quick instructions I suppose 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.840
 stickers that I can not anymore stickers 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.530
 and this is for 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.180
 to open the tray of those that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.610
 always ends up losing and finished 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.690
 using a click 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.690
 the same 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.870
 and here we have this headphones 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.880
 I think they are more or less the ones that came 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.849
 with the iPhone 5 I do not know because I do not 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.930
 had but has not appeared to see it by 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.930
 nothing is very good 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.739
 the charger that I already have a few 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.849
 but I think that this battery is more 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.459
 big so look at the other's luxury 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.680
 Loader the drawer that I can no longer have 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.769
 more chargers of things 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.430
 and the hand 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.430
 Well, it's already 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.490
 here we have the important 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.490
 let's remove the plastic from this 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000
 let's see if it does not fall 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.000
 this out 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.669
 They are very pleasant to the touch in aluminum 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.130
 this by the way talking about aluminum 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.650
 I suppose you have seen that they say that 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.650
 the iPad is doubled, so let's try 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.430
 after he has a lot of money and nothing 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.080
 I my opinion is that to double it 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.880
 you have to do a lot of strength and it's 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.280
 clear is aluminum is going to bend the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.310
 aluminum bends and does not return to its shape 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.080
 because because not just flexible the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.030
 plastic is flexible then it 's a 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.720
 plastic mobile, it is clear that 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.070
 return to its shape and it will not bend but 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.260
 I do not know what he's going to do 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.260
 this with your mobile or sit on top 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.159
 the one that I had so far is the note 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.930
 that in principle I think it's the same 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:36.289
 size than iphone 6 plus 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.569
 OK 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.550
 it is great of the iphone in the 6 this normal 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.100
 because they were decisions we did not expect 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.370
 small but good 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.889
 messer and we see the differences in terms 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.590
 to inches 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.050
 but good 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.300
 I already tell you that this is plastic 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.370
 each title crumbles but returns 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.660
 to its shape because it 's plastic these 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.660
 aluminum these quality 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.689
 I think I do get tired a little bit of 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.479
 android 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:15.659
 I've been using both because in a 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.479
 I had the iphone, I got tired of it 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.009
 iphones I happened to android and now I 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.849
 tired of android I guess inside 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.110
 of a year or two I'm tired the trailers is 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.599
 to go changing a bit of system 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.749
 I suppose but well this means that 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:34.860
 apple I do not want to get into trouble but I 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:37.770
 it seems a lot more fluid than android and 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.349
 I see it as more finished I do not know I do not know 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.560
 explain it but android itself is very 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:46.020
 powerful and has a lot of freedom but it's 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.110
 that apple is very fluid 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.680
 do not be like that things happen and nothing does not 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.160
 roll over this has been the inbox and 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.160
 let's leave here 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.400
 and nothing we see in the next video 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:04.630
 I hope you liked it and a greeting to 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.630
 all god
