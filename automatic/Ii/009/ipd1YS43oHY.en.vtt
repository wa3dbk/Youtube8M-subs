recently had a surgery I'll link that
video<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:49.740> below<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.729> recently<00:01:50.939> had<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
video down below but I recently had a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
video down below but I recently had a
surgery<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.649> doctor<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.310> warned<00:01:53.850> me

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
surgery and my doctor actually warned me

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
surgery and my doctor actually warned me
about<00:01:54.149> gaining<00:01:54.930> weight<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.950> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
about gaining weight because this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
about gaining weight because this
particular<00:01:56.759> surgery<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.200> not

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
particular surgery and you know I'm not

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
particular surgery and you know I'm not
gonna<00:01:58.469> get<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.340> did<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
gonna get into it because I did do a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
gonna get into it because I did do a
separate<00:02:00.090> video<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
separate video about that but this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380 
separate video about that but this
surgery<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.430> basically<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.119> makes<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
surgery you know basically just makes it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.319 
surgery you know basically just makes it
harder<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> digest<00:02:04.469> food<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.820> makes<00:02:06.180> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
harder to digest food and it makes you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
harder to digest food and it makes you
more<00:02:06.509> susceptible<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.259> holding<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
more susceptible to holding on to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.749 
more susceptible to holding on to
fattening<00:02:08.670> any

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
fattening any

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
fattening any
a<00:02:09.789> fad<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.569> she<00:02:10.629> warned<00:02:11.230> me<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> could

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
a fad so she warned me that I could

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
a fad so she warned me that I could
possibly<00:02:12.340> gain<00:02:12.640> weight<00:02:12.849> afterwards<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.750> sure

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
possibly gain weight afterwards and sure

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.020 
possibly gain weight afterwards and sure
enough<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:14.680> after<00:02:14.829> my<00:02:15.189> surgery<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.700> did

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
enough right after my surgery I did

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.240 
enough right after my surgery I did
notice<00:02:16.299> about<00:02:16.689> a<00:02:16.750> week<00:02:16.989> later<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.650> getting<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
notice about a week later just getting a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.130 
notice about a week later just getting a
little<00:02:18.819> bit<00:02:18.939> heavier<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.450> gaining<00:02:20.049> about

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
little bit heavier and gaining about

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.069 
little bit heavier and gaining about
five<00:02:20.500> pounds<00:02:21.189> and<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.849> basically<00:02:22.299> after<00:02:22.689> my

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
five pounds and so basically after my

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.619 
five pounds and so basically after my
surgery<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.860> really<00:02:24.459> wanted<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.209> careful

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
surgery I really wanted to be careful

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.809 
surgery I really wanted to be careful
and<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:25.959> make<00:02:26.140> sure<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:27.069> surgery

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
and just make sure that my surgery

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.509 
and just make sure that my surgery
didn't<00:02:28.180> cause<00:02:28.420> me<00:02:28.720> any<00:02:29.280> unnecessary<00:02:30.280> weight

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
didn't cause me any unnecessary weight

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.490 
didn't cause me any unnecessary weight
gain<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.360> feel<00:02:31.569> like<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> book<00:02:31.989> was<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.200> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
gain and I feel like the book was just a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.319 
gain and I feel like the book was just a
really<00:02:32.739> good<00:02:32.890> starting<00:02:33.579> point<00:02:33.909> a<00:02:34.030> really<00:02:34.209> good

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
really good starting point a really good

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.960 
really good starting point a really good
jumping-off<00:02:34.780> point<00:02:35.200> um<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:36.129> think<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.670> lot<00:02:36.940> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
jumping-off point um I think a lot of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.119 
jumping-off point um I think a lot of
times<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.540> be<00:02:37.599> super<00:02:38.140> overwhelming<00:02:38.769> to

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
times it can be super overwhelming to

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.759 
times it can be super overwhelming to
look<00:02:39.549> for<00:02:40.090> weight<00:02:40.599> loss<00:02:40.840> sources<00:02:41.409> because

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
look for weight loss sources because

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.979 
look for weight loss sources because
there's<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.159> many<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.700> know<00:02:42.790> juicing<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.629> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
there's so many you know juicing and the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.500 
there's so many you know juicing and the
magic<00:02:44.409> diet<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.859> Beyonce<00:02:45.370> diet<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.329> it's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
magic diet the Beyonce diet and so it's

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.960 
magic diet the Beyonce diet and so it's
it's<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.019> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.290> nice<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> find<00:02:48.099> something

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
it's just kind of nice to find something

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.000 
it's just kind of nice to find something
that's<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.420> goes<00:02:49.750> back<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.230> basics<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.769> little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that's like goes back to basics a little

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.330 
that's like goes back to basics a little
bit<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.519> just<00:02:51.730> more<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:53.069> simpler<00:02:54.069> book

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
bit and it's just more of a simpler book

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.149 
bit and it's just more of a simpler book

explained a lot about metabolism and

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.940 
explained a lot about metabolism and
just<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.209> how<00:03:04.389> things<00:03:04.690> work<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.590> just

kind of what you need to do to get

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.430 
kind of what you need to do to get
everything<00:03:09.129> under<00:03:09.940> control<00:03:10.389> so<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.079> have<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
everything under control so you have the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.740 
everything under control so you have the
book<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:12.010> think<00:03:12.819> it's<00:03:12.970> been<00:03:13.180> reduced<00:03:13.569> from

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
book I think it's been reduced from

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.530 
book I think it's been reduced from
$9.99<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> 399<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.790> an<00:03:15.940> e-book<00:03:16.299> I'll

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540

tool and I think it's important to have
like<00:03:25.120> some<00:03:25.540> sort<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.840> motivation<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.680> feel<00:03:27.010> like

like some sort of motivation I feel like
your<00:03:27.250> friends<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.790> family<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.840> should

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
your friends and family you know should

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.170 
your friends and family you know should
be<00:03:29.349> supportive<00:03:29.919> but<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.400> feel<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.790> that's<00:03:31.000> not

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
be supportive but I feel like that's not

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.729 
be supportive but I feel like that's not
always<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.660> case<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.260> definitely

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
always the case and that definitely

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
always the case and that definitely
hasn't<00:03:32.980> been<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> case<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:33.849> me<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.269> haven't

hasn't been the case for me I haven't

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.229 
hasn't been the case for me I haven't
always<00:03:34.930> had<00:03:35.019> that<00:03:35.609> constant<00:03:36.609> support<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.209> I

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
always had that constant support so I

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.729 
always had that constant support so I
feel<00:03:37.419> like<00:03:37.449> it<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.900> important<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.620> have
