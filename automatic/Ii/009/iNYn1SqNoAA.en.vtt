00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
package back over here I don't see it

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.330

just step nice well three can see the
blades<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.669> any<00:05:29.020> main<00:05:30.020> problem<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.770> have

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
blades and the any main problem I have

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.630 
blades and the any main problem I have
with<00:05:31.190> this<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.430> closing<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:33.340> after<00:05:34.340> a<00:05:34.370> while

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
with this is closing it after a while

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.279 
with this is closing it after a while
when<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.030> just<00:05:35.240> mess<00:05:35.419> around<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.870> it

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
when you just mess around with it

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.950 
when you just mess around with it
it<00:05:37.010> hurts<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:38.030> close<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.360> because<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.720> see

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
it hurts to close it because you see

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.770 
it hurts to close it because you see
this<00:05:39.140> little<00:05:39.410> part<00:05:39.680> that's<00:05:39.919> flap<00:05:40.430> that's<00:05:41.300> kind

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
this little part that's flap that's kind

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.170 
this little part that's flap that's kind
of<00:05:41.840> bent<00:05:42.140> up<00:05:42.700> that's<00:05:43.700> holding<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.330> blade<00:05:44.539> out

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
of bent up that's holding the blade out

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.510 
of bent up that's holding the blade out
so<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.240> have<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.570> push<00:05:47.840> that<00:05:48.080> down<00:05:48.190> like<00:05:49.190> so

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
so you have to push that down like so

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.300 
so you have to push that down like so
and<00:05:49.960> then<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.080> blade<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.380> able<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.890> come<00:05:52.130> back

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
and then the blade is able to come back

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
and then the blade is able to come back
