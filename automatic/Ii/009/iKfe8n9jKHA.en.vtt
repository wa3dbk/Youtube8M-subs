00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.360
 like this subject 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.310
 and others 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.690
 I'm going to sting 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 with time 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.360
 for her to stay 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.360
 all these two beautiful days I could in this sense what his veil 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 what would his right that all had reopened 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.389
 to start in a well-known Belgian casserole winner of the classic 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 right now 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 the fact that he has other things nobody 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.520
 it's immediately a little smoke 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 his parents out of frame and dry the caravel 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 that makes sense all 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 the two young people who knew how to write 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.869
 New York 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.359
 in France 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 to do this 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 we expect a crowd to follow its entry into force little bit 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.109
 and to add again 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 while the rest of the sugar 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.429
 this until all the supports are thoroughly 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 I'm interested in him 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.160
 harp 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.490
 when caramel or do good to liquidate who panic that aims to 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.799
 stop cooking 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.279
 in a Frankfurt lounge are essential 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.620
 we do not stop harder to wait so I pulled out and then another 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.579
 Eric gerets past my tomatoes 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.669
 in sugar 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.309
 completely 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.809
 as for the agreement it is the pr 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.809
 the survivors too long I had supported caramel 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.809
 I do not have french areva 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.809
 and I'm laying there 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.729
 while the agent to show what not to do 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.659
 so while he had suffered 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
 we go to caramel 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.480
 we see that tomatoes to which I often talk 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.759
 it does not matter it's okay 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.659
 the tomatoes a little soft 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.659
 here I do not speak but it causes 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:40.939
 so we will try we will do with 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.310
 with one of the capelle and more with a tomato attached 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.709
 here I go before 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 I come out 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.180
 I have 30 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.629
 and I pose 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.069
 yes it's not complicated 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.649
 how the joy contained in the package by France is deep enough 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.349
 I will then be careful that with this spades 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.649
 this is mathias 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.959
 the pot to the roses 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.619
 and I pose 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.419
 I'm so tight 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.169
 soak them half 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.199
 it's quite feasible 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.229
 what is good is that most be very fine 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.650
 and how quickly we pass the caravel the tomato did not attempt to 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.590
 to run away 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.720
 she is here to serve as the ten operations 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 with sugar so I spend 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.550
 I ask myself 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.500
 the president 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.909
 here it is already finished 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.909
 not contradict him another witness 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.469
 then at the end of 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.620
 m 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.560

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.999
 that's why 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.189
 it's not much higher 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.189
