00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.849
 Insulated sloped roof will not allow 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 only reduce heat loss but also 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.740
 significantly increase the usable area 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.139
 home to create a warm and cozy 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 attic we need insulation and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.039
 membrane course 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.230
 to protect the roof from atmospheric 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 precipitation we fix waterproofing 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.300
 membrane of the course secular am 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.050
 the installation process will be much easier 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.730
 thanks to the unique adhesive strip 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 after this set bars counter 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.829
 about lattices they will help create 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.559
 vented space then 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.030
 we mount the roof covering further 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 go to the insulation 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.260
 material ursa geo sloped roof 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.100
 designed specifically for insulation 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.289
 roofs 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.629
 it is manufactured according to ur technology 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.550
 schluntz which is successfully applied in 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.370
 Germany's feature of this technology 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.769
 is to create a structure of 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.110
 strained elastic fibers namely 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.450
 so the material is securely fixed in 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 roof structures besides this 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 insulation is non-flammable and safe for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.649
 health that is confirmed by certificates 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.869
 size insulating moto 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.270
 allow you to chop it both along and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.090
 across and install in the roof with any 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.250
 step rafters waste in the process almost 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.850
 insulation thickness is not formed 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.740
 is 150 or 200 millimeters and this 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.170
 means it can be installed in 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.710
 one layer if the distance between 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.259
 rafters 590 millimeters matt width 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.409
 1 meter 20 centimeters are cut 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.659
 along the full length of moto 3 meters 90 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.539
 centimeters allows you to warm the whole 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.909
 span one material easy 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.280
 becomes in thrust between the rafters and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.190
 securely held without additional 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.430
 mounts 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.090
 if the rafter step is less than or greater than 600 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.610
 millimeters 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.830
 mat can be cut across on plates 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.200
 the length of each slab must be 10 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.780
 millimeters more than the distance between 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.610
 rafters in the holy 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.220
 due to the increased elasticity of the material 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.040
 fits snugly and does not form 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.380
 clearance the next step is the installation 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.260
 vapor barrier course acer a. 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.820
 the film is installed on the bottom of the rafter and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.230
 attached to them with brackets for 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.810
 protect the vapor barrier against possible 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.630
 damage from the bottom of the structure 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.430
 mounted in bars counter sheathing on 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.660
 the final stage proceed to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.970
 finishing work 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.550
 properly insulated sloping roof 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 provide warmth and comfort in the attic 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 and will significantly save on 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.730
 home heating 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.830
 insulation and membrane course work 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.100
 together ursa geo pitched roof saves 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.230
 heat vapor barrier urs acecop 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.660
 protects against internal vapor membrane 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.600
 Ursa Secu Am protects against atmospheric 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.600
 precipitation and removes vapors with insulation
