so<00:00:14.590> HP<00:00:15.010> have<00:00:15.160> used<00:00:15.370> our<00:00:15.550> technology<00:00:16.150> to<00:00:16.420> create

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
so HP have used our technology to create

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.290 
so HP have used our technology to create
a<00:00:16.800> universal<00:00:17.800> docking<00:00:18.100> station<00:00:18.550> which<00:00:19.030> allows

also<00:00:36.610> get<00:00:36.940> these<00:00:37.120> USB<00:00:37.450> graphics<00:00:38.020> adapters

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
also get these USB graphics adapters

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.490 
also get these USB graphics adapters
these<00:00:39.129> USB<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.180> from<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.449> notebook<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:41.110> then

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
these USB and from the notebook and then

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.950 
these USB and from the notebook and then
DVI<00:00:41.949> or<00:00:42.040> VGA<00:00:42.340> out<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.360> just<00:00:43.510> connect<00:00:43.840> this

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
DVI or VGA out and you just connect this

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.140 
DVI or VGA out and you just connect this
to<00:00:44.110> your<00:00:44.140> existing<00:00:44.680> monitors<00:00:45.129> there<00:00:45.850> are<00:00:45.970> some

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
to your existing monitors there are some

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.670 
to your existing monitors there are some
monitors<00:00:46.510> in<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.690> market<00:00:47.050> for<00:00:47.140> example<00:00:47.379> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
monitors in the market for example the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.560 
monitors in the market for example the
Samsung<00:00:48.160> laugher<00:00:48.610> that<00:00:49.239> have<00:00:49.360> got<00:00:49.540> the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
Samsung laugher that have got the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.660 
Samsung laugher that have got the
technology<00:00:49.780> embedded<00:00:50.559> in<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.769> monitor<00:00:51.160> so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
technology embedded in the monitor so

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.549 
technology embedded in the monitor so
this<00:00:51.820> allows<00:00:52.089> you<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.480> connect<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.960> USB<00:00:52.989> cable

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
this allows you to connect a USB cable

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.259 
this allows you to connect a USB cable
straight<00:00:53.980> into<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.400> back<00:00:54.579> of<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> monitor<00:00:54.910> of

and<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.619> need<00:01:05.770> one<00:01:05.799> of<00:01:06.010> those<00:01:06.220> graphics

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
and you need one of those graphics

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.219 
and you need one of those graphics
adapters<00:01:07.619> monitors<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.770> want<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.070> use

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
adapters monitors that you want to use

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.840 
adapters monitors that you want to use
adding<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.409> additional<00:01:11.470> monitors<00:01:12.250> allows

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
adding the additional monitors allows

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.820 
adding the additional monitors allows
you<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.180> increase<00:01:13.420> your<00:01:13.540> desktop<00:01:14.110> space<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
you to increase your desktop space and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.710 
you to increase your desktop space and
it<00:01:15.010> fully<00:01:15.250> integrates<00:01:15.820> into<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.420> Windows

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
it fully integrates into the Windows

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.200 
it fully integrates into the Windows
operating<00:01:16.869> system<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:18.030> these<00:01:19.030> are

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
operating system and these are

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.120 
operating system and these are
independent<00:01:19.450> displays<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:20.890> be

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
independent displays that can be

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.429 
independent displays that can be
independently<00:01:21.970> configured<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.290> can

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
independently configured and you can

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.249 
independently configured and you can
expand<00:01:23.860> your<00:01:24.159> desktop<00:01:24.850> space<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:26.020> therefore

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
expand your desktop space and therefore

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.670 
expand your desktop space and therefore
increase<00:01:26.710> your<00:01:26.890> productivity

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
increase your productivity

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.780 
increase your productivity
and<00:01:28.980> then<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.450> okay<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.640> have

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and then over here okay so here we have

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.710 
and then over here okay so here we have
a<00:01:32.820> USB<00:01:33.780> 3<00:01:34.050> technology<00:01:34.710> preview<00:01:34.980> and<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
a USB 3 technology preview and this just

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.250 
a USB 3 technology preview and this just
shows<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.560> next<00:01:37.830> level<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.370> USB<00:01:38.970> graphics<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
shows the next level of USB graphics so

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.550 
shows the next level of USB graphics so
right<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.040> 1080p<00:01:41.790> video<00:01:42.630> playing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
right now there's a 1080p video playing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210 
right now there's a 1080p video playing
on<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.520> FPGA<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> shows<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
on our FPGA then this shows that this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.400 
on our FPGA then this shows that this
flawless<00:01:47.460> HD<00:01:48.000> playback<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
flawless HD playback which would be

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.790 
flawless HD playback which would be
coming<00:01:49.740> soon<00:01:50.010> with<00:01:50.580> USB<00:01:51.210> 3

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.960 

where<00:01:55.040> can<00:01:55.190> people<00:01:55.250> learn<00:01:57.370> so<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.820> have<00:01:58.940> a
