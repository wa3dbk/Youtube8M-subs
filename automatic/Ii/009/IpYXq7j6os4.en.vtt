00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
a look at the new Faraday bike it's an e

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
a look at the new Faraday bike it's an e
bike<00:00:11.670> which<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.179> totally<00:00:12.630> beautiful<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.440> is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
bike which is totally beautiful this is

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200 
bike which is totally beautiful this is
gonna<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> first<00:00:14.460> time<00:00:14.759> where<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.150> a

who pre-ordered it really soon so I'm
here<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.270> Adam<00:00:21.600> who's<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.710> founder<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here with Adam who's the founder of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.790 
here with Adam who's the founder of
Faraday<00:00:24.000> tell<00:00:24.960> me<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> little<00:00:25.140> bit<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.500> how

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
Faraday tell me a little bit about how

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
Faraday tell me a little bit about how
you<00:00:25.859> got<00:00:26.099> started<00:00:26.340> building<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:27.420> yeah

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
you got started building this thing yeah

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.429 
you got started building this thing yeah
so<00:00:28.680> Faraday's<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.670> long<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.840> started

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
so Faraday's come a long way we started

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.630 
so Faraday's come a long way we started
off<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> concept

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
off as a concept

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.930 
off as a concept
when<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.480> at<00:00:33.719> IDEO<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> design<00:00:34.620> firm

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
when I was at IDEO the design firm

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.010 
when I was at IDEO the design firm
basically<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.030> were<00:00:36.149> asked<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> build<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
basically we were asked to build the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
basically we were asked to build the
ultimate<00:00:37.170> city<00:00:37.860> bike<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> big<00:00:38.489> bike<00:00:38.670> design

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ultimate city bike for a big bike design

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
ultimate city bike for a big bike design
contest<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.870> built<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> bike<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.500> called

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
contest and we built a bike we called

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
contest and we built a bike we called
the<00:00:41.309> Faraday<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.149> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> our<00:00:43.110> vision

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the Faraday that was kind of our vision

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
the Faraday that was kind of our vision
of<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.950> electric<00:00:44.129> bike<00:00:44.399> could<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of what an electric bike could be and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.170 
of what an electric bike could be and
that<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:47.280> received<00:00:47.640> people<00:00:48.000> were<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that got so well received people were so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
that got so well received people were so
excited<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.079> spun<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.350> out

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
excited about that that we spun it out

full circle of that process okay
excellent<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> road<00:01:04.979> bike<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
excellent and it's it's a road bike but

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.910 
excellent and it's it's a road bike but
it's<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:05.670> an<00:01:06.240> e-bike<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.320> well<00:01:07.710> yeah

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it's also an e-bike right well yeah

it's also an e-bike right well yeah
what's<00:01:08.760> what's<00:01:09.119> powering<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.659> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
what's what's powering this thing so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
what's what's powering this thing so
it's<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> motor<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> front<00:01:12.180> wheel

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it's got a motor in the front wheel

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
it's got a motor in the front wheel
right<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.580> motor<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.479> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
right there motor there and then just a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.149 
right there motor there and then just a
regular<00:01:15.869> geared<00:01:16.290> hub<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> back<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
regular geared hub in the back there's a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219 
regular geared hub in the back there's a
battery<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:18.180> built<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
battery that's built right into the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.820 
battery that's built right into the
frame<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.049> when<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> went<00:01:22.740> out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
frame and so when we kind of went out

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.109 
frame and so when we kind of went out
and<00:01:22.860> looked<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.189> other<00:01:23.310> Evite's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and looked at other Evite's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
and looked at other Evite's
what<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.890> pretty<00:01:26.549> put

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what was out there we were pretty put

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
what was out there we were pretty put
off<00:01:26.850> by<00:01:27.299> kinda<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.750> saw<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
off by kinda what we saw it was a lot of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.789 
off by kinda what we saw it was a lot of
big<00:01:29.220> clunky<00:01:30.030> hulking<00:01:30.570> battery<00:01:30.900> packs<00:01:31.140> hanging

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
big clunky hulking battery packs hanging

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
big clunky hulking battery packs hanging
out<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.840> really

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
out you know here or here and it really

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.450 
out you know here or here and it really
affected<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bike<00:01:34.890> looked<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
affected the way the bike looked and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.450 
affected the way the bike looked and
rode<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.420> felt<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.189> wanted

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
rode and felt and so with this we wanted

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.780 
rode and felt and so with this we wanted
to<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lightweight<00:01:39.180> ebike<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.110> was

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
to make a lightweight ebike that was

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.500 
to make a lightweight ebike that was
beautiful<00:01:41.750> that<00:01:42.740> housing<00:01:43.280> power<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.090> range

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
beautiful that housing power and range

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.760 
beautiful that housing power and range
and<00:01:44.690> everything<00:01:44.750> else<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.230> so<00:01:45.350> that's<00:01:45.500> kind

and everything else and so that's kind
of<00:01:45.800> what<00:01:46.010> John<00:01:46.910> is<00:01:47.030> here<00:01:47.180> yeah<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:47.810> gonna<00:01:47.930> say

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
of what John is here yeah it's gonna say

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.590 
of what John is here yeah it's gonna say
I've<00:01:48.380> seen<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> fair<00:01:49.670> number<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.000> e-bikes<00:01:50.390> at

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
I've seen a fair number of e-bikes at

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480 
I've seen a fair number of e-bikes at
this<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.230> this<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.250> beautiful

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
this point and this is really beautiful

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.610 
this point and this is really beautiful
so<00:01:52.970> you've<00:01:53.090> got<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.810> batteries<00:01:54.230> hidden

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
so you've got like the batteries hidden

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.250 
so you've got like the batteries hidden
in<00:01:54.860> here<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.880> tube<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:56.570> built<00:01:56.900> right<00:01:57.110> in

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
in here in the tube it's built right in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.650 
in here in the tube it's built right in
the<00:01:57.350> frame<00:01:57.590> yucca<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.520> then<00:01:58.760> this<00:01:58.910> this<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.480> lot

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
the frame yucca and then this this a lot

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.210 
the frame yucca and then this this a lot
of<00:01:59.690> people<00:01:59.780> often<00:02:00.110> think<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.620> in<00:02:00.860> the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
of people often think that this in the

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.530 
of people often think that this in the
back<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.640> where<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.850> battery<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.450> is

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
back is where the battery is this is

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.410 
back is where the battery is this is
actually<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.900> brain<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.620> bike<00:02:03.770> really<00:02:04.420> so

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
actually the brain of the bike really so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.790 
actually the brain of the bike really so
the<00:02:05.660> controller<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.200> here<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.470> runs<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
the controller in here that runs the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.190 
the controller in here that runs the
motor<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:08.030> runs<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.450> rear<00:02:08.630> lights<00:02:08.840> exudes

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
motor that runs the rear lights exudes

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.630 
motor that runs the rear lights exudes
lights<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.710> back<00:02:09.830> there<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.460> light

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
lights in the back there and the light

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
lights in the back there and the light
in<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.790> front<00:02:10.940> that's<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.750> powered<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
in the front that's all powered in the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.440 
in the front that's all powered in the
back<00:02:12.350> there<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.790> runs<00:02:13.940> sort<00:02:14.390> of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
back there and then it runs sort of

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.540 
back there and then it runs sort of
through<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.930> frame<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> motor<00:02:15.890> okay

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
through the frame of the motor okay

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.650 
through the frame of the motor okay
and<00:02:16.760> how<00:02:17.060> powerful<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.959> like<00:02:19.300> will<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.450> just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
and how powerful is it like will it just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.970 
and how powerful is it like will it just
like<00:02:20.900> sort<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.200> drive<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.560> down<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> street

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
like sort of drive you down the street

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.610 
like sort of drive you down the street
so<00:02:22.570> one<00:02:23.570> thing<00:02:23.720> we've<00:02:23.870> done<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.380> taken

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so one thing we've done is really taken

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.990 
so one thing we've done is really taken
a<00:02:24.680> lot<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.830> care<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.340> assist<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:25.910> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
a lot of care with the assist so that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.370 
a lot of care with the assist so that
you<00:02:26.150> don't<00:02:26.330> feel<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.930> driving<00:02:27.230> in<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
you don't feel like it's driving in the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.850 
you don't feel like it's driving in the
street

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
street

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.130 
street
it's<00:02:27.980> kind<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:29.420> almost<00:02:29.630> sneaks<00:02:29.870> up<00:02:30.050> on

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it's kind of like it almost sneaks up on

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's kind of like it almost sneaks up on
you<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.560> feel<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.220> are

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
you you just feel like you are

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.770 
you you just feel like you are
incredibly<00:02:31.970> strong<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.420> actually<00:02:32.630> it's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
incredibly strong it's actually it's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.090 
incredibly strong it's actually it's
really<00:02:32.989> cool<00:02:33.170> ok<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.660> numbers<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.320> 350

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
really cool ok so like in numbers is 350

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.400 
really cool ok so like in numbers is 350
watt<00:02:37.280> motor<00:02:37.730> what<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.480> really<00:02:38.660> means<00:02:38.900> it'll

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
watt motor what that really means it'll

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.400 
watt motor what that really means it'll
do<00:02:39.590> about<00:02:40.250> three<00:02:40.580> times<00:02:40.820> your<00:02:41.360> power<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.290> if

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
do about three times your power so if

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.690 
do about three times your power so if
you<00:02:42.530> put<00:02:42.650> out<00:02:42.739> about<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.980> hundred<00:02:43.130> watts<00:02:43.430> it'll

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you put out about a hundred watts it'll

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.060 
you put out about a hundred watts it'll
put<00:02:43.820> about<00:02:43.970> 300<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.320> adds<00:02:45.560> quite<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.830> lot<00:02:45.980> of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
put about 300 and it adds quite a lot of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
put about 300 and it adds quite a lot of
power<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.310> it'll<00:02:47.000> take<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.239> about<00:02:47.390> 20<00:02:47.690> miles

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
power so it'll take you about 20 miles

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.300 
power so it'll take you about 20 miles
an<00:02:47.959> hour<00:02:48.050> kind<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> possibly<00:02:48.890> cruising<00:02:49.220> around

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
an hour kind of possibly cruising around

is left okay in the thing you can turn
it<00:03:05.570> off<00:03:05.750> right<00:03:05.989> there<00:03:06.200> or<00:03:06.739> put<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.250> kind<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it off right there or put it in kind of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.710 
it off right there or put it in kind of
a<00:03:07.519> low<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> high<00:03:08.000> mode<00:03:08.299> we<00:03:08.420> call<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.600> high

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
a low or a high mode we call the high

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.180 
a low or a high mode we call the high
boost<00:03:09.110> mode<00:03:09.350> that's<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:09.980> like<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
boost mode that's kind of like the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.340 
boost mode that's kind of like the
Superman<00:03:10.610> okay<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.660> faster<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.110> can<00:03:12.170> go
