conveniently lost it of course anyway I

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.910 
conveniently lost it of course anyway I
love<00:03:01.719> the<00:03:01.810> waiting<00:03:02.109> screens<00:03:02.379> here<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.829> the

well<00:03:11.379> well<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:11.980> know<00:03:12.129> it's<00:03:12.310> old<00:03:12.549> maybe<00:03:13.510> maybe

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
well well you know it's old maybe maybe

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:14.819 
well well you know it's old maybe maybe
it's<00:03:14.200> out<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.469> ink

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
it's out of ink

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.349 
it's out of ink
maybe<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.189> jammed<00:03:15.579> or<00:03:15.730> something<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.180> don't

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
maybe it's jammed or something I don't

know<00:03:16.419> Jeff<00:03:16.659> after<00:03:16.840> researching<00:03:17.439> on<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
know Jeff after researching on the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.319 
know Jeff after researching on the
Internet<00:03:18.010> apparently<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.579> gameboy<00:03:18.909> printer

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
Internet apparently the gameboy printer

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.990 
Internet apparently the gameboy printer
uses<00:03:19.719> thermal<00:03:20.139> printing<00:03:20.560> technology<00:03:21.219> which

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
uses thermal printing technology which

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.509 
uses thermal printing technology which
means<00:03:22.569> nothing<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.169> dog<00:03:23.409> or<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:24.189> me<00:03:24.310> for

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
means nothing to the dog or to me for

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.670 
means nothing to the dog or to me for
that<00:03:24.639> matter<00:03:24.879> so<00:03:25.090> I'll<00:03:25.209> take<00:03:25.389> a<00:03:25.629> Game<00:03:26.469> Boy

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
that matter so I'll take a Game Boy

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.009 
that matter so I'll take a Game Boy
camera<00:03:27.129> selfie<00:03:27.909> and<00:03:28.090> try<00:03:28.389> to<00:03:28.449> print<00:03:28.750> that

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
camera selfie and try to print that

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.259 
camera selfie and try to print that
instead<00:03:29.469> maybe<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.370> doesn't<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:31.030> dogs

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
instead maybe it just doesn't like dogs

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.319 
instead maybe it just doesn't like dogs
maybe<00:03:31.629> I<00:03:31.750> need<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.319> Game<00:03:32.590> Boy<00:03:32.620> camera<00:03:33.329> selfie

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329
