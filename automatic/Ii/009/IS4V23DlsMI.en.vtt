00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.160
 greet you dear friends today i 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.730
 I'll show you a set of lego creator house on 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.710
 tree 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 I'll say right away that this set is very me 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 I liked it because I love 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.910
 reverse structure 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 the boxes are all three models 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.330
 which we can collect from this set 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.340
 and of course the main functions are listed 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.820
 set three instructions one for each 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.820
 assembly 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.540
 from the instructions we can understand what three 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.160
 models are built in complexity and 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.230
 the most difficult to build is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 basic tree house model 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 if now we are touched by such an approach i 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.380
 I think that all three models should be 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.090
 as interesting as possible and should not 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.390
 used maximum amount 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.390
 details 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 rename single minifigure 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 represented in this set this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 little boy with freckles who 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.850
 dressed inconspicuous where the without prints 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 she speak his sweet red cap like 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 you see his legs shorter than that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 standard me figures but in Lebanon 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 always used to distinguish 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 adult minifigure from 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 baby handbag own dog 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
 they are not happy that it is made of ordinary 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.920
 bricks lego they are a solid piece 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.600
 as it happens in lego city 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.060
 but although in both cases there is 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.369
 our hero also has its pros and cons 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 and the yellow cart which can 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.530
 put accessories like a walkie talkie 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 or stick if you can call it 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 accessory near the lawn on which 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.330
 growing tree is located a small pond 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.310
 in it we can find such a frog as 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.009
 you see around the tree are all covered 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 flowers and vegetation that creates 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.080
 very nice house impression 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.090
 located on two trees between them 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.090
 trunks laid stone path 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.399
 in the base 2 of the tree we can find 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.170
 cache 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.170
 which is located map 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.670
 well and now let's get to the most important thing 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
 house our hero will be able to climb on 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.190
 the stairs upstairs besides the building itself 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.500
 he will discover the top of the tree as well 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.570
 viewing platform in addition to which 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.570
 just have a winch with a bucket 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:52.579
 top of the tree and the house and can be easily 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:54.340
 disconnect the house from the site at least 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.709
 small but two-storied 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.659
 ground floor and yellow box and cot 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.909
 and we see the house has three 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.719
 small windows and one big one 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.719
 can open 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.670
 on the second floor is just an open area 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.740
 where you can arrange something also 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.740
 on the roof we can detect the blue flag 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.850
 stairs can be removed to the top for this 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.270
 it needs to be raised up and fixed 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.390
 special pin and then fold it 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.390
 in half 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.290
 lays out the most in reverse 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.290
 sequences 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.080
 if in spite of taking 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.600
 ladder you anyway somebody gets 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.030
 below you can pour on the enemy 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.990
 a box of water but before that you need somewhere 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.020
 take this water 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.820
 here we will need a winch and a bucket 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.820
 let the winds down the pond get water 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.850
 then raise the bucket and pour water 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.280
 box all now someone if you 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.970
 worry then greet him wet 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.970
 to the last thread 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.980
 and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.300
 the second model is this house at the pier 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.580
 around the house a lot of small interesting 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.360
 parts behind the house there is a small 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.360
 tree 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.210
 on this house roof is removed 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.420
 Incidentally, completely covered 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.420
 vegetation 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.910
 inside we can find a nice 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.380
 the interior is on the left we have a stove oven 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.260
 and nightstands 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.710
 By the way in the oven on a baking sheet located 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.710
 pizza 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.820
 on the right we have a cabinet with a lamp she 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.010
 days picture as for cons at this 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.960
 house there is co2 by yes but no 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.670
 doors so any passer can 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.740
 steal our pizza is sad well and 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.050
 finally the third model who's there 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.150
 It is proposed to assemble another cart and on 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.460
 This time she more model itself 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.330
 is a small vegetable garden and 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.080
 two-story hangar on the second floor there 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.420
 stairs 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.300
 then we can find the box ready 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.360
 located race and other little things on 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.430
 winch roof thanks to it and bucket 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.060
 will be able to raise various vegetables for 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.060
 storage 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.710
 I also want to mention cool stone 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.370
 path leading to the hangar as well 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.560

 likes under all my videos 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.970
 keep up the good work because you 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.980
