we're going to get cold snap for a snipe
I<00:01:34.500> splashing<00:01:35.100> reflection<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.020> our<00:01:37.020> loadout

I splashing reflection and our loadout

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
I splashing reflection and our loadout
will<00:01:37.799> look<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:40.340> Arctic<00:01:41.340> gust<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:42.030> I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
reflection if it's off to cool down just

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.060 
reflection if it's off to cool down just
to<00:02:45.000> keep<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.360> chill<00:02:45.570> effect<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
to keep the chill effect up so when you

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
start the fight you won't have to do the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
start the fight you won't have to do the
two<00:02:49.290> rotations<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.460> bonus<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
two rotations to get the bonus just you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.300 
two rotations to get the bonus just you
will<00:02:51.480> start<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.960> one<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.800> already<00:02:52.920> get

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
will start with one and we already get

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.860 
will start with one and we already get
the<00:02:53.580> virtual<00:02:54.030> effect<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.450> how<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the virtual effect so this is how the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:04:00.320 
the virtual effect so this is how the
rotation<00:02:58.680> looks<00:02:59.580> like<00:02:59.880> an<00:03:00.120> action

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.800
