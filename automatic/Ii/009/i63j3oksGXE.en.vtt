00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello friends from that stool 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.040
 how are you today I wanted to talk to you 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.740
 little about gaming in the engine or the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.809
 2nd generation g motorcycle but good 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.030
 as you will know by the specifications 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.730
 techniques especially for the interior of the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.810
 device so what I'm going to talk about 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.390
 is basically also worth for the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.240
 2013 device for the model 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.669
 previous with this video I wanted to inaugurate 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.170
 a small section how are you? 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.200
 already inaugurating type pills 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.520
 technological and duels etc. in 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.030
 the good one I wanted to talk a little bit 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.160
 about the motogp because you know what it is 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.930
 a device that is super sold that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.239
 does not have many people who are interested 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.890
 still more people because good 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.219
 It has a very competitive price with a 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.769
 pretty interesting and good performance 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.850
 Well, I think it could be very interesting 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.590
 talk about not only the device in 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.989
 yes and about the updates of 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.210
 software that by the way yesterday what 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.700
 updated and believing that it was 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.920
 in the update for android 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.010
 lollipop but no it was not it was a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.320
 update that good then to go towards 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.409
 the left we see ourselves as for example 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.479
 has google now some updates 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.430
 I would have more things but good 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.440
 for what state you can see by 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.880
 above that was the main novelty 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.159
 Well, I wanted to talk to you today 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 about gaming in this engine or motorbike 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.930
 g of second generation the truth that 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.660
 we are faced with a device like 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.940
 you will know that he does not have a few 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.410
 butt end components but yes it is 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.289
 true that we will not have any 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.300
 problem to play big for not 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.729
 tell all the games that we 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.220
 we find today in the google 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.039
 play because I say this so good because 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.929
 I had the opportunity to try the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.250
 games that we say require more 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.040
 specifications or put more to the test 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.870
 our device 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.970
 is that I have not come across any 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.920
 kind of problem at least in the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.710
 first 40 minutes so to speak 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.740
 because it is true that in games like 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.290
 the fifa 15 ultimate team if I 've 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.810
 found that after 40 minutes 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.940
 playing has slowed down to what is the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.190
 game never came close but yes 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
 it's true that it overheated a lot 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.840
 which is the back of the device 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.600
 and this I do not know if it is solely due to 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 this 8 inch screen that sorry 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.300
 of 5 inches that the truth that does very 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.940
 very good gaming experience 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.500
 we also have to keep in mind that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.870
 this device now I'm talking 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.900
 well of 2014 because in that is 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.260
 practically where there are more changes 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.970
 between mode g of 2014 or 2013 and is that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.830
 we find a pretty design 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.350
 economic with which we will be able to be 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
 playing with both hands and if we have 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.510
 good care in theory the big toes 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.430
 we're going to have it put in the pack of the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.620
 own screen and we will not have 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.300
 no problem of saturation 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.390
 speakers that now as you know they are 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.670
 in the part 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.470
 front and with this curved design the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.959
 true that fits very well at hand 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.069
 both one hand and two hands so 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.680
 Well, it's something that I found 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.110
 which is very very comfortable to play in this 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.209
 device thing that good because not what 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.750
 It was in the Samsung Galaxy S2 where 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.750
 we had a worse screen not in terms 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.870
 to resolution or to how 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.980
 as to how it looks but it is true 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.350
 that more girl and being a more design 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.880
 square because we liked the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.980
 hand thing that has surprised me because 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.200
 the truth is that little by little I am 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.300
 taking a lot of love to this 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 terminal so good as I said 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.560
 Many people believe that with these 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.860
 specifications with which the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.250
 moto gp with this qualcomm processor 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.959
 snapdragon 400 and qualcomm and in the gpu 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.640
 qualcomm adreno 305 that in theory goes to 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.630
 have problems because good one is 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.220
 a snuff dragon 801 I do not know 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.350
 snapdragon 805 is not an opening or cap of 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.810
 spectrum 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.780
 but honestly I think we 're not going to 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.910
 have create one as it is I could 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.670
 check and we will not have any type 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.400
 of problems that I do believe that the only thing 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.050
 that is going to fail a little is the memory 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.790
 internal, as you will know at least 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.090
 this device we only have 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.340
 we have 8 gigabytes and so that 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.410
 we have no problem 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.390
 I would recommend what I told you when 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.550
 I did the analysis of this device and 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.300
 is that emigration is what all the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.210
 applications to a good micro sd 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.340
 external to the micro sd that you have in 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.670
 your device because if you do not go 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.710
 to find that as soon as you put metais 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.290
 some games few because good 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.150
 it does not take many to reach 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.800
 those eight gigabytes because as you know 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.720
 the vast majority of these games that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.880
 they have a lot of capacity as can 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.410
 be the modern combat as can be the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.380
 fifa and 15 as it can be alpha 8 then 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.480
 have minimum occupy almost 1 with 2 1 with 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.430
 3 gb therefore all those 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.590
 applications that you have and passing it 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.230
 automatically to the micro sd yes no 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.540
 find you with a memory problem 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.760
 which can be serious because many times 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.070
 we will find ourselves as if we do not have 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.260
 it records me to the micro sd the applications 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.480
 and the games we will not be able to have 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.890
 installed more than one as they happen to me and 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.050
 right now he was trying 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.120
 download me the dawn 8 I had it 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.070
 previously but could not for that reason 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.360
 because I do not have internal memory and I have 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.800
 to pass what are all the 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.820
 applications and all data 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.370
 practically to the sd so nothing else 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.140
 that nothing was to make you see those 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.330
 that you are a little undecided or 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.580
 those who have this terminal that does not 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.520
 you are going to have any kind of problems 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.710
 apart from this one of the one that deals with 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.290
 in the internal memory of the device 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.080
 these eight gigabytes that has rom or 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.970
 that after the best 40-50 minutes 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.250
 playing with the screen with the brightness to 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.020
 but then we find that 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.360
 problem that slows down a bit 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.860
 the game not the device because in 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.230
 As to quit the game and close it 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.540
 we let rest a few minutes again 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.700
 we will be able to continue playing without problems 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.390
 but good those only two problems 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.150
 but 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.370
 the truth that I sincerely believe that no 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.800
 you will notice at any time if you do not 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.620
 Do not give too much cane that you are 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.670
 before a device at 179 euros and not 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.550
 during one or playing in one of 300 or 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.050
 even 400 euros so nothing 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.720
 give me I like if you liked this 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.370
 video so read I do not like dislike if 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.110
 unfortunately we did not like it 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.970
 subscribe if you want to be up to date 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.220
 as for the videos that go up 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.810
 greetings and see you in the next 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.810
 video of that band
