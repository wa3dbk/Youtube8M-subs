anything so I've read on mine I guess to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
anything so I've read on mine I guess to
check<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.410> battery<00:00:35.010> terminals<00:00:35.550> maybe

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
check you know battery terminals maybe

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
check you know battery terminals maybe
with<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> multimeter

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
with a multimeter

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
could it be a fuse

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.789

maybe there's so many possibilities let
me<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.909> looking<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.330> fuses<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
me see I was looking at my fuses and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.649 
me see I was looking at my fuses and
something<00:01:15.390> seems<00:01:15.630> strange<00:01:16.159> online<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:18.299> seemed

something seems strange online it seemed
like<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.259> fuses<00:01:19.770> should<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.570> like<00:01:21.920> 7.57<00:01:22.920> like

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like the fuses should be like 7.57 like

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.899 
like the fuses should be like 7.57 like

oil<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.650> dirt<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.190> don't<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.090> where<00:02:18.209> that's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
oil and dirt I don't know where that's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
oil and dirt I don't know where that's
coming<00:02:18.450> from<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.530> looks<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.400> all

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
coming from it's it looks like it's all

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.020 
coming from it's it looks like it's all
wet<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:20.970> there<00:02:21.410> kind<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.500> leaking<00:02:22.770> down<00:02:23.030> into

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
wet in there kind of leaking down into

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.970 
wet in there kind of leaking down into
here<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:25.070> took<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.400> spark<00:02:26.700> plugs<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
here I took on my spark plugs that was a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.040 
here I took on my spark plugs that was a
little<00:02:29.160> bit<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.370> oil<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> see

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
little bit of oil in there you can see

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.910 
little bit of oil in there you can see
it's<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.410> wet

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
it's a little wet

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.360 
it's a little wet
I<00:02:32.000> also<00:02:33.000> found<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.110> don't<00:02:35.100> know<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.340> is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
I also found a I don't know if this is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.020 
I also found a I don't know if this is
okay<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> my<00:02:36.390> spark<00:02:36.870> plug<00:02:36.930> wires

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
okay but one of my spark plug wires

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.770 
okay but one of my spark plug wires
enough<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.590> torn<00:02:41.780> torn

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
enough is this one was like torn torn

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.560 
enough is this one was like torn torn
and<00:02:42.989> inside<00:02:43.440> inside<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.980> hole<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:45.510> know

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
and inside inside that hole I don't know

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.090 
and inside inside that hole I don't know
that's<00:02:45.750> good<00:02:46.050> or<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:47.180> again<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:49.100> knowledge

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that's good or not again your knowledge

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.430 
that's good or not again your knowledge
is<00:02:50.250> much<00:02:50.489> appreciated

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
is much appreciated

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.509 
is much appreciated
so<00:02:53.280> yeah<00:02:53.400> about<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> starting<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:55.400> didn't<00:02:56.400> want

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
so yeah about the starting I didn't want

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.210 
so yeah about the starting I didn't want
to<00:02:56.580> start<00:02:56.850> before<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.019> had<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.500> issue<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to start before I had to issue the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.630 
to start before I had to issue the
engine<00:02:59.730> would<00:02:59.940> turn<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.160> did<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.519> I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
engine would turn so what I did is I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.949 
engine would turn so what I did is I
solder<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.090> main<00:03:03.269> relay<00:03:03.600> there<00:03:03.900> my

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
solder the main relay there my

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
solder the main relay there my
researcher<00:03:04.260> saw<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> main<00:03:04.680> relay<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
researcher saw the main relay in and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.289 
researcher saw the main relay in and
they're<00:03:05.850> working<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.489> don't<00:03:09.150> know

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
they're working now that I don't know

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.090 
they're working now that I don't know
one<00:03:09.570> all<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.260> sudden<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:10.650> Black<00:03:10.830> Friday

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
one all of a sudden I'm Black Friday

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.300 
one all of a sudden I'm Black Friday
just<00:03:11.250> didn't<00:03:11.670> wanna<00:03:11.820> turn<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.130> try

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
just didn't wanna turn on so we try

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.210 
just didn't wanna turn on so we try
pushing<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.790> turned<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.890> day<00:03:17.190> I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
pushing it turned on so that that day I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
pushing it turned on so that that day I
pushed<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:17.970> three<00:03:18.150> times<00:03:18.390> because<00:03:18.510> they

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
pushed it like three times because they

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.380 
pushed it like three times because they
kept<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.440> wouldn't<00:03:19.739> turn<00:03:19.860> back<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.390> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
kept they just wouldn't turn back on the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.720 
kept they just wouldn't turn back on the
battery<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.870> good<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.739> at<00:03:23.040> least<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.549> it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
battery is good or at least I think it's

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000 
battery is good or at least I think it's
good<00:03:24.140> hopefully<00:03:25.140> with<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> multimeter<00:03:25.709> I'll

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
good hopefully with the multimeter I'll

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.130 
good hopefully with the multimeter I'll
be<00:03:26.160> able<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> check<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.209> was<00:03:27.780> able<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.989> use

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
be able to check but I was able to use

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.620 
be able to check but I was able to use
my<00:03:28.320> power<00:03:28.560> windows<00:03:28.980> lights<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.940> mean<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.390> didn't

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
my power windows lights I mean it didn't

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.000 
my power windows lights I mean it didn't
seem<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:31.049> anything<00:03:31.320> was<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
seem like anything was out of the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.330 
seem like anything was out of the
ordinary

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
ordinary

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.620 
ordinary
maybe<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.640> terminals<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.360> don't<00:03:36.540> know

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
maybe it's my terminals I don't know

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.979 
maybe it's my terminals I don't know
they<00:03:36.870> don't<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.230> look<00:03:37.709> dirty

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
they don't really look dirty

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.319 
they don't really look dirty
maybe<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:42.000> check<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.480> out

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.640 

so<00:03:46.329> yeah<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:46.599> wasn't<00:03:46.840> clicking<00:03:47.109> I<00:03:47.379> would<00:03:47.530> hear

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
so yeah I wasn't clicking I would hear

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.970 
so yeah I wasn't clicking I would hear
no<00:03:47.799> clicking<00:03:48.129> no<00:03:48.430> noise<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:49.060> anything<00:03:49.980> turn

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
no clicking no noise not anything turn

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.589 
no clicking no noise not anything turn
the<00:03:51.129> ignition<00:03:51.189> on<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:51.849> know<00:03:51.939> push<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.420> clutch

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
the ignition on you know push the clutch

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.580 
the ignition on you know push the clutch
all<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:53.019> down<00:03:53.230> I'm<00:03:53.499> not<00:03:53.650> an<00:03:53.739> idiot<00:03:55.590> yeah

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
all the way down I'm not an idiot yeah

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.629 
all the way down I'm not an idiot yeah
I'm<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.889> a<00:03:56.980> little<00:03:57.450> little<00:03:59.639> flabbergasted

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
I'm just a little little flabbergasted

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:12.050 
I'm just a little little flabbergasted
right<00:04:00.790> now<00:04:01.590> yeah<00:04:02.590> there's<00:04:02.799> my<00:04:02.920> b16a<00:04:10.469> that<00:04:11.469> bad

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
right now yeah there's my b16a that bad

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.610 
right now yeah there's my b16a that bad
so<00:04:13.060> yeah<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.209> took<00:04:13.269> up<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.780> was<00:04:14.019> like<00:04:14.139> okay<00:04:14.409> well<00:04:14.590> I

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
so yeah I took up I was like okay well I

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.170 
so yeah I took up I was like okay well I
just<00:04:14.799> got<00:04:14.919> a<00:04:14.950> check<00:04:15.129> of<00:04:15.249> the<00:04:15.340> spark<00:04:15.730> there's<00:04:16.060> an

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
just got a check of the spark there's an

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.729 
just got a check of the spark there's an
extra<00:04:16.479> connection<00:04:16.959> maybe<00:04:17.139> something<00:04:17.590> wasn't

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
extra connection maybe something wasn't

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.099 
extra connection maybe something wasn't
clicking<00:04:17.949> right<00:04:18.340> -<00:04:19.060> got<00:04:19.209> these<00:04:19.449> two<00:04:19.870> got<00:04:19.989> my

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
clicking right - got these two got my

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.439 
clicking right - got these two got my
spark<00:04:20.410> plugs<00:04:20.650> they<00:04:21.340> look<00:04:21.579> a<00:04:21.699> little<00:04:21.820> weird<00:04:22.150> but

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
spark plugs they look a little weird but

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.330 
spark plugs they look a little weird but
I'm<00:04:22.870> not<00:04:23.110> really<00:04:23.229> too<00:04:23.650> sure<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:23.919> they're<00:04:24.130> good

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
I'm not really too sure if they're good

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.960 
I'm not really too sure if they're good
or<00:04:24.370> not<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:25.210> also<00:04:25.840> had<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.139> leak<00:04:26.880> when<00:04:27.880> we

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
or not I also had this leak when we

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.540 
or not I also had this leak when we
tried<00:04:28.180> pushing<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.660> car<00:04:28.900> in<00:04:29.020> here

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
tried pushing the car in here

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.020 
tried pushing the car in here
I<00:04:30.870> heard<00:04:31.870> bubbling<00:04:32.349> and<00:04:32.620> then<00:04:32.889> when<00:04:33.039> when<00:04:33.880> we

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
I heard bubbling and then when when we

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.249 
I heard bubbling and then when when we
stopped<00:04:34.330> pushing<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.810> car<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.139> when<00:04:35.229> I

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
stopped pushing the car and when I

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.930 
stopped pushing the car and when I
parked<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.710> here<00:04:35.740> like<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.310> realized<00:04:36.639> that<00:04:36.759> it

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
parked it here like I realized that it

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.210 
parked it here like I realized that it
was<00:04:37.030> leaking<00:04:37.300> some<00:04:38.229> kind<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.500> liquid<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.099> I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
was leaking some kind of liquid and I

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.770 
was leaking some kind of liquid and I
see<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.729> it<00:04:39.820> was<00:04:39.910> like<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.180> part<00:04:40.449> steering

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
see and it was like the part steering

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.990 
see and it was like the part steering
fluid<00:04:41.229> was<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:41.530> leaking<00:04:41.830> from<00:04:42.009> I'm<00:04:42.849> not

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
fluid was like leaking from I'm not

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.900 
fluid was like leaking from I'm not
really<00:04:43.150> sure<00:04:43.720> exactly<00:04:43.870> where<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:44.699> all<00:04:45.699> of

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
really sure exactly where but all of

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.189 
really sure exactly where but all of
this<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.120> wet<00:04:46.710> not<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:48.009> you<00:04:48.520> know<00:04:48.550> there<00:04:49.199> so

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
this is wet not just you know there so

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.170 
this is wet not just you know there so
I'm<00:04:50.320> going<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.620> kill<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.190> could<00:04:51.880> get<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
I'm going to kill that I could get the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.060 
I'm going to kill that I could get the
car<00:04:52.419> to<00:04:52.479> turn<00:04:52.840> off<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.380> that's<00:04:53.560> not<00:04:53.710> wrapping

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
car to turn off so that's not wrapping

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.360 
car to turn off so that's not wrapping
me<00:04:54.190> before<00:04:55.440> some<00:04:56.440> things<00:04:56.650> I've<00:04:56.860> done<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
me before some things I've done to the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.310 
me before some things I've done to the
car<00:05:00.180> well<00:05:01.180> not<00:05:01.360> really<00:05:01.479> that<00:05:01.690> much<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.080> kind<00:05:02.259> of

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
car well not really that much I kind of

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.810 
car well not really that much I kind of
bought<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.740> car<00:05:02.949> like<00:05:03.039> this<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.430> guess<00:05:03.580> it's<00:05:03.759> a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
bought the car like this I guess it's a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.779 
bought the car like this I guess it's a
JTA<00:05:04.180> model<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.780> kind<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.800> got<00:05:05.949> stopped<00:05:06.340> so<00:05:06.669> they

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
JTA model I kind of got stopped so they

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.460

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
or whatever they look clean but it just

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.970 
or whatever they look clean but it just
it's<00:06:04.280> not<00:06:04.490> like<00:06:04.550> your<00:06:04.880> regular<00:06:05.090> brake<00:06:05.690> dust

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980

it's not like your regular brake dust
it's<00:06:06.980> like<00:06:07.100> this<00:06:07.250> liquid<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:07.880> seems<00:06:08.360> to

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
it's like this liquid that seems to

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.910 
it's like this liquid that seems to
start<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.160> burn<00:06:10.550> and<00:06:10.970> degrade<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.200> rim<00:06:14.860> so<00:06:15.860> I'm

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
start to burn and degrade the rim so I'm

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.290 
start to burn and degrade the rim so I'm
not<00:06:16.010> really<00:06:16.160> sure<00:06:16.460> where<00:06:16.670> it's<00:06:16.850> leaking

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300
