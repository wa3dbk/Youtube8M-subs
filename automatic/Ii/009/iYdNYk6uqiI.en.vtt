country and we've got 14 academies also

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.559 
country and we've got 14 academies also
that<00:00:42.699> covered<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:42.969> length<00:00:43.179> of<00:00:43.300> breadth<00:00:43.449> of

the country so I think it is important

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.379 
the country so I think it is important
and<00:00:46.389> it<00:00:47.489> reflects<00:00:48.489> our<00:00:48.639> strength<00:00:48.940> i<00:00:49.059> think<00:00:49.239> is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
and it reflects our strength i think is

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:51.599 
and it reflects our strength i think is
a<00:00:49.420> ruby<00:00:50.109> flare<00:00:50.379> nation<00:00:50.679> it's<00:00:51.039> an<00:00:51.159> important

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
a ruby flare nation it's an important

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:52.829 
a ruby flare nation it's an important
message<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:51.969> send<00:00:52.149> anything<00:00:52.479> that<00:00:52.749> the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
message to send anything that the

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.539 
message to send anything that the
england<00:00:53.139> team<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.499> torn<00:00:53.979> from<00:00:54.100> everywhere

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
makes is our ultimate strength what are

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.390 
makes is our ultimate strength what are
they<00:01:22.810> taking<00:01:23.050> personality<00:01:23.590> bring<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.310> how

Cup well I mean that's the that's the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.320 
Cup well I mean that's the that's the
point<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.550> know<00:03:00.610> people<00:03:00.880> should<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.150> able<00:03:01.210> to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
point you know people should be able to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.540 
point you know people should be able to
connect<00:03:01.570> with<00:03:01.630> every<00:03:01.900> player<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.590> the

connect with every player because the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.400 
connect with every player because the

whole of the nations represented it's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.200 
whole of the nations represented it's
not<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> regional<00:03:06.070> sport<00:03:06.430> we<00:03:06.550> have<00:03:06.700> rubinyan

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
not a regional sport we have rubinyan

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.170 
not a regional sport we have rubinyan
it's<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.630> national<00:03:08.080> sport<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.970> strong
