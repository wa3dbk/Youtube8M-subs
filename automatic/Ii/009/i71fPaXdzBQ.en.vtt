railroad club or just anything
everything's<00:02:39.269> gonna<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.659> at<00:02:39.959> least<00:02:40.170> 720p<00:02:40.610> but

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
everything's gonna be at least 720p but

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.860 
everything's gonna be at least 720p but
definitely<00:02:41.940> 1080p<00:02:42.390> when<00:02:42.569> recording

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
definitely 1080p when recording

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.569 
definitely 1080p when recording
especially<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.769> games<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.220> gonna<00:02:44.340> try

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
especially for games I'm gonna try

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.690 
especially for games I'm gonna try
really<00:02:45.239> hard<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.599> get<00:02:45.810> 1080p<00:02:46.769> recordings<00:02:47.549> out

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
really hard to get 1080p recordings out

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.119 
really hard to get 1080p recordings out
there<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.690> because<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:49.650> helps

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
there just because it it really helps

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.530 
there just because it it really helps
especially<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> build<00:02:50.940> videos<00:02:51.269> when<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
especially for the build videos when the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.710 
especially for the build videos when the
text<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.079> small<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.680> screen<00:02:53.540> well<00:02:54.540> when

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
text is so small on the screen well when

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360 
text is so small on the screen well when
you<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> resolution<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.160> put

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
you up the resolution you can get put

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.309 
you up the resolution you can get put
the<00:02:56.519> 720p<00:02:57.090> video<00:02:57.299> out<00:02:57.420> there<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.720> 1080p<00:02:58.170> out

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the 720p video out there and 1080p out

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.720 
the 720p video out there and 1080p out
there<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.849> all<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.160 

like<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> fine<00:03:06.030> details<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:08.299> really<00:03:09.299> but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
like the fine details so really but

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.470 
like the fine details so really but
let's<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.799> go<00:03:11.190> through<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.430> specs<00:03:11.640> here<00:03:11.730> so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
let's just go through the specs here so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.140 
let's just go through the specs here so
it's<00:03:12.629> 1920<00:03:13.079> by<00:03:13.200> 1080<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> two<00:03:14.609> millisecond

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
it's 1920 by 1080 is a two millisecond

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.720 
it's 1920 by 1080 is a two millisecond
response<00:03:15.239> time<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:16.500> does<00:03:16.889> have<00:03:17.250> built-in

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
response time it does have built-in

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.400 
response time it does have built-in
speakers<00:03:18.269> but<00:03:18.480> they're<00:03:18.660> not<00:03:18.870> all<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.079> good<00:03:19.349> I

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
haven't tested them yet but from the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.520 
haven't tested them yet but from the
reviews<00:03:21.090> I've<00:03:21.239> seen<00:03:21.450> they're<00:03:22.079> not<00:03:22.200> all<00:03:22.380> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
diagonally does that that's how you do

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.500 
diagonally does that that's how you do
measure<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.959> monitor<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:32.150> really<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.389> never

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
measure a monitor and really I never

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.729 
measure a monitor and really I never
knew<00:03:33.959> how<00:03:34.230> large<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.739> 23<00:03:35.549> inch<00:03:35.639> screen<00:03:35.700> would<00:03:36.540> be

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
knew how large a 23 inch screen would be

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.979 
knew how large a 23 inch screen would be
until<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.799> put<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.190> my<00:03:38.310> desk<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:39.419> didn't<00:03:39.780> see

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
until I put it on my desk it didn't see

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.470 
until I put it on my desk it didn't see
it<00:03:40.079> my<00:03:40.500> friend<00:03:40.739> had<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.889> 21.5<00:03:41.639> inch<00:03:41.849> screen<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.000 
it my friend had a 21.5 inch screen and
it<00:03:42.690> didn't<00:03:42.959> seem<00:03:43.109> all<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.290> big<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.949> me<00:03:46.010> but

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it didn't seem all that big to me but

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.589 
it didn't seem all that big to me but

playing slender yet on this monitor I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.050 
playing slender yet on this monitor I

coming<00:04:34.350> out<00:04:34.470> soon<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:35.010> get<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.030> scare<00:04:36.240> myself<00:04:36.420> at

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750

a<00:04:36.780> higher<00:04:36.930> resolution<00:04:37.230> I<00:04:37.620> guess<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:40.610> this

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
a higher resolution I guess so this this

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.690 
a higher resolution I guess so this this
is<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> nice<00:04:42.000> big<00:04:42.180> improvement<00:04:42.950> I've<00:04:43.950> had<00:04:44.520> like
