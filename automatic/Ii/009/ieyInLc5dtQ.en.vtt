all toys tins for a size reference this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.220 
all toys tins for a size reference this
one<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> two<00:00:52.410> times<00:00:52.680> tall<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.570> tags<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.079> these

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
one is two times tall the tags on these
are<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.520> except

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
are going to be just like this except

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.130 
are going to be just like this except
for<00:00:59.000> turning<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.960> one

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
for turning this way because this one

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
for turning this way because this one
wraps<00:01:01.350> around<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:05.339> didn't<00:01:05.580> have

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
wraps around this way I just didn't have

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
wraps around this way I just didn't have
any<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> logo<00:01:06.479> facing<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> right

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
any with the logo facing the right

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.280 
any with the logo facing the right
direction<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:11.090> these<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.540> big<00:01:12.810> enough<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
direction so these are big enough to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.460

so I will put these sizes of these in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.109 
so I will put these sizes of these in
the<00:01:57.000> descriptions<00:01:57.540> these<00:01:57.720> have<00:01:58.729> six<00:01:59.729> inches

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the descriptions these have six inches

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
the descriptions these have six inches
tall<00:02:00.390> pockets<00:02:00.990> whereas<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> original<00:02:01.710> one

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
tall pockets whereas the original one

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130 
tall pockets whereas the original one
has<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:02.579> inch<00:02:02.729> tall<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.810> double

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
has three inch tall this is just double

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.590 
has three inch tall this is just double
six<00:02:04.380> inches<00:02:04.619> tall<00:02:04.860> same<00:02:05.250> width<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.700> five<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
six inches tall same width as five and a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.850 
six inches tall same width as five and a
half<00:02:06.630> inches<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.739> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
half inches I think and this would be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:24.190 
half inches I think and this would be
the<00:02:13.920> size<00:02:14.190> large<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> medium

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:35.930 

original<00:02:25.459> medium<00:02:28.819> has<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:35.370> set<00:02:35.549> up<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.760> little

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
original medium has just set up a little

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.610 
original medium has just set up a little
differently<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:38.580> also<00:02:39.030> holds<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.620> Altoids

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
differently this also holds for Altoids

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.030 
differently this also holds for Altoids
tins<00:02:40.860> total<00:02:42.200> set<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.319> on<00:02:43.470> kind<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
tins total set up on kind of more of a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.759 
tins total set up on kind of more of a
square<00:02:44.340> than<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> rectangle<00:02:45.420> idea<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:49.440> holds

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
square than a rectangle idea this holds

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.339 
square than a rectangle idea this holds
them<00:02:49.890> upright<00:02:50.819> instead<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.989> way<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
them upright instead of this way it

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.490 
them upright instead of this way it
holds<00:02:55.590> them<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.830> way<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:57.930> nothing<00:02:58.290> fancy

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
holds them this way and so nothing fancy

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:10.270 
holds them this way and so nothing fancy
so<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.459> holds<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.239> Lloyd's<00:03:09.570> tins

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
so this one holds for out Lloyd's tins

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.160 
so this one holds for out Lloyd's tins
and<00:03:11.280> that's<00:03:11.790> pretty<00:03:11.970> much<00:03:12.090> what<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.600> will<00:03:12.720> hold
