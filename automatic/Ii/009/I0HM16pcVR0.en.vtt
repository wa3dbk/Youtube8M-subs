00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.680 
not been throwing I know it's very very
important<00:01:52.040> because<00:01:52.250> he<00:01:52.730> has<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.850> very<00:01:53.030> very<00:01:53.330> new

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
important because he has a very very new

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.930 
important because he has a very very new
but<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.170> think<00:01:54.440> being<00:01:54.590> borrowed<00:01:55.010> and<00:01:55.670> sale

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
but I think being borrowed and sale

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.400 
but I think being borrowed and sale
actually<00:01:56.060> we've<00:01:56.390> got<00:01:56.600> follow<00:01:56.900> way<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.290> you

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
actually we've got follow way of you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.110 
actually we've got follow way of you
enjoying<00:01:57.620> it<00:01:57.890> people<00:01:58.250> either<00:01:58.400> liking<00:01:59.000> each

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
enjoying it people either liking each

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.570 
enjoying it people either liking each
other<00:01:59.330> or<00:01:59.810> we're<00:01:59.960> liking<00:02:00.590> ourselves<00:02:01.340> or<00:02:01.460> we're

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
other or we're liking ourselves or we're

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.040 
other or we're liking ourselves or we're
doing<00:02:01.730> something<00:02:02.120> with<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.330> other<00:02:02.480> but<00:02:03.020> I

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
doing something with the other but I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.480 
doing something with the other but I
think<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> energy<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:04.040> you<00:02:04.130> put<00:02:04.160> out

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
think it's the energy that you put out

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.280 
think it's the energy that you put out
there<00:02:04.550> which<00:02:05.000> represents<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.780> energy<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.170> the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
there which represents the energy of the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.570 
there which represents the energy of the
film<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.710> usually<00:02:07.160> we're<00:02:07.250> putting<00:02:07.490> a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
film and usually we're putting a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.760

and Frank has asked three of you amongst

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.309 
and Frank has asked three of you amongst
your<00:03:04.430> contemporaries<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.900> saw<00:03:06.079> a<00:03:06.110> movie

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
your contemporaries that you saw a movie

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.380 
your contemporaries that you saw a movie
and<00:03:06.560> bitched<00:03:06.739> at<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.579> wish<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:07.970> was<00:03:08.120> part<00:03:08.329> of

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
and bitched at it I wish I was part of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.559 
and bitched at it I wish I was part of
that<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.040> think<00:03:10.190> everybody<00:03:10.970> fits<00:03:11.209> their

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
that so I think everybody fits their

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.930 
that so I think everybody fits their
parts<00:03:12.170> perfectly<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.980> mean<00:03:13.159> I<00:03:13.280> wouldn't<00:03:13.610> I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
parts perfectly and I mean I wouldn't I

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.610 
parts perfectly and I mean I wouldn't I
mean<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.510> wouldn't<00:03:14.840> want<00:03:15.019> anybody<00:03:15.230> else<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.560> be

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
mean I wouldn't want anybody else to be

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.649 
mean I wouldn't want anybody else to be
bottom<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.099> assume<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.700> nobody<00:03:17.000> else<00:03:17.120> will<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.629> a

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
bottom I assume so nobody else will be a

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.210 
bottom I assume so nobody else will be a
part<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.019> their<00:03:18.200> films<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.590> their<00:03:18.769> roles

part of their films in their roles

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.800 
part of their films in their roles
maybe<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:19.879> complete<00:03:20.629> justice<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.170> them<00:03:21.799> I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
maybe just complete justice to them I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.089 
maybe just complete justice to them I
don't<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.930> any<00:03:24.079> recent<00:03:24.349> films<00:03:24.769> but<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.980> have
