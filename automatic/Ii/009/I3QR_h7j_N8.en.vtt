00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 a few days ago the first one leaked 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.440
 teaser trailer for batman versus super 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.860
 boss of justice which was going to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 premiere exclusively in imax cinemas 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.130
 from the USA on Monday, April 20 but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 someone came forward and leaked a trailer 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.660
 with subtitles in Portuguese before this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.570
 filtering warner bros and zack snyder 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.449
 They decided to publish the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.640
 teaser trailer so we can see it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 and in this video I'm going to analyze what 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 we have so far in this teaser 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.969
 almost nothing is revealed about the plot 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 but rather the look is revealed 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.370
 anfield or the tone we will have in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 this movie we already know that the style 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 visual of zack snyder is very particular 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 and in this movie you see that he's going to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.789
 expose much more than he did in 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 man of steel 'and we already know that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.989
 snyder likes the dark so this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.570
 trailer also shows us that the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 movie will be with a very dark tone and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 serious what strikes me is that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.890
 at least I have wanted to introduce ourselves to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.710
 a much more realistic and lowered superman 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.720
 to our reality 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.000
 like what we saw in the trilogy of the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.530
 dark knight by christopher nolan nolan 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.150
 was a producer of hands team but now 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.550
 that is not a producer of batman versus 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.310
 superman it seems that sachs nÃ©ider wants 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.280
 paint your line and leave that style 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.610
 realistic back and put more your style 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.800
 visual more fantastic and in addition to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.550
 do it as if it were a panel of a 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.170
 comic 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.380
 for example, see those shots and the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.759
 lighting in these everything looks very 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.130
 fantastic and very far from our 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.950
 actually made up the statue that 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.590
 comes out of superman looks like very made 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.060
 computer and nothing realistic on the one hand 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.780
 it's interesting but on the other 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.899
 it is confusing that unless there is 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.360
 a tone and suddenly change it in batman 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.759
 versus superman if supposedly everything is 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.820
 part of the same universe if the trailer 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.800
 of -7 remembered batman begins now the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.479
 trailer of batman versus superman te 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.479
 remember other zack movies 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.460
 snyder like 300 and draw out this punch 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.709
 teaser focuses mainly on the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.260
 current status of superman on earth 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.299
 after the events of man of steel ' 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.579
 the reaction of the earthlings towards kale 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.920
 the love of love-hate because while 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 that many adore him and consider him a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.470
 savior many others hate him and he 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.319
 complain about what many fans complained 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.079
 in uncle hands that although he did not save the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.409
 land in the process destroyed much of 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.569
 of metropolis and even murdered one of 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.519
 your own kind like trusting a 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.769
 very powerful alien that could 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.019
 destroy us and you crave it so we see 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.900
 a great duality of opinions while 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.959
 that a statue is erected in his name and 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.180
 many praise him and believe in him many 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.159
 others hate it and are afraid of it and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.409
 they consider a false deity that only 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.750
 It causes chaos and destruction and they want 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.909
 leave this planet you will remember that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.709
 in the comic the dark knight returns in 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.139
 which is slightly based this 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.840
 movie the media 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.970
 they play a very important role in several 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.819
 occasions we see televised debates in 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.370
 what some personalities think to 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.920
 favor and against the superheroes of 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.850
 the villains and the ravages that these 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.010
 have caused in society because this 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.230
 we are presented with something similar with several 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.180
 voices commenting on superman until the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.800
 moment have been identified some of 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.990
 these voices confirming that they are 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.720
 real-life journalists like bill 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.090
 Moyers and charlie rose addition of genius 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.340
 tyson fats and also out there sounds the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.260
 voice of ex mourning or good rather of 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.300
 jesse eisenberg and interpreting the author 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.460
 among the voices we hear something from 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.020
 The most important thing they say is that 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.390
 humans have a history 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.970
 terrible when we have followed 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.190
 people with a lot of power and throwing him 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.260
 firewood lex luthor says now 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.630
 We know that demons do not come from 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.490
 below but from up there apart from this 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.830
 kind of debate we also listen 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.190
 another voice in another context that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.960
 apparently it is the one of alfred pennyworth 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.000
 played by jeremy irons alfred 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.820
 says anger and anger 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.280
 of impotence are what make a 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.020
 good man in a cruel one and this what 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.150
 we listen while we see ben affleck 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.010
 as bruce wayne contemplating with a 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.250
 angry expression on his batman costume 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.590
 as if thinking about putting it back on 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.910
 stop what is happening 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.210
 it basically seems as if seeing the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.280
 study 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.470
 giving a tip type I give a gross 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.330
 disapproving his attitude in the dark 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.220
 knight with franz we saw superman 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.349
 try to stop batman and it seems that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.960
 now the papers are going to be reversed and 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.120
 we will see batman try to stop 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.729
 superman or we see superman stopping 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.099
 a Russian rocket and at that time we can 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.229
 analyze his suit which has some 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.210
 minimal changes but if you have them 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.009
 interesting to see that scene where there 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.349
 some soldiers kneeling before the 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.680
 presence of superman and if we analyze 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.840
 his arms have the badge of 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.300
 superman for some reason we see the 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.830
 batmobile in action which then already 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.870
 I had seen before in photos that 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.820
 they filtered from the set but the funny thing 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.860
 is that we also see a plane that 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.780
 apparently it's from batman and that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.270
 it could probably be the same 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.710
 batmobile as for bad blake the little 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.680
 that we can see so far you see 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.690
 spectacular the design and texture of 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.880
 costume is fantastic and you can see that 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.099
 really if he got into the gym the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.960
 Mr. affleck because he looks pretty 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.660
 strong and like that can be put to you 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.760
 for you with henry cavill as superman 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.680
 Salgado to learn from him there is a scene 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.930
 from batman very interesting but also 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.780
 unusual because we see batman in the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.180
 point of what appears to be a tower and 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.280
 It might look like it 's next to a 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.920
 antenna but if we analyze this shot well 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.080
 it really looks like he's holding a 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.540
 rifle but if batman does not like 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.270
 pistols we see batman in a building 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.970
 abandoned and full of graffiti but not 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.280
 there are clues as to where that building is 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.380
 why is there the funny thing is that between 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.760
 these graffiti we can see from the side 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.730
 left one of a sign of 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.700
 interrogation which reminds us 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.430
 the villain edward nygma better known 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.230
 like riddler and we also see it using 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.420
 the armor that batman uses in the dark 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.850
 knight with arms and they looked very good 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.800
 for this moment we finally see a 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.830
 proven from the confrontation that there will be 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.660
 between batman and superman and finally one of 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.360
 they speak we listen to batman 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.120
 ask superman if he bleeds and then 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.760
 confirms that if the curious bled 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.670
 is that your voice is modified by a 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.130
 voice modulator the question is what use 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.800
 only when you use the armor or 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.900
 always but because they fight there is still no 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.120
 nothing confirmed but among the rumors 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.950
 that have been said is that among all this 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.800
 controversy of whether it is good or bad 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.050
 superman lex luthor washes his head 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.420
 batman and makes him believe he is an enemy 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.520
 that must be overcome to save the 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.040
 land this teaser is definitely 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.020
 completely focused on superman like that 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.270
 that we hope that the next one 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.130
 focus now on batman remember that 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.020
 originally this was considered to 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.970
 was going to be less useful 2 so 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.040
 obviously has more weight superman 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.930
 because it is the continuation of its history 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.340
 what did you think about this trailer? 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.900
 they expected more 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.910
 tell me in the comments for more
