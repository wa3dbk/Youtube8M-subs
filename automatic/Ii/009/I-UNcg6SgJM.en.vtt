00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.020
 Welcome to the second part of our ex-club Ask your own 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.399
 little game 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.299
 XX Cult for iPhone can create 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.040
 That's what we currently have 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.759
 Baradar 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.429
 and can this free field move around on the fret 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.420
 the wireless does not happen yet 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.900
 and the sponsorship me otherwise if we are the citizens and the smiley face 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.980
 push 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 the Bernese vanishes and he is free how happy we are 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.050
 There are now two options, the doctors more than a private Zizi 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 to create a pact for the covenant and that their depot comes then say "If the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.860
 body 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.170
 in this self-programmed pulls her grows as said Uematsu Karin said 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.980
 is always such a right because ready German can get in that 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.710
 Thursday simply continue running 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.840
 However, to do this IT make needed SAP 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.269
 Nationalgoalie data and that is relatively expensive 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.019
 That's why I do not want them or just prefer a JU in my mouth 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:02.730
 create 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.830
 and then in the program can say if the Bernese 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.760
 This minute in the mouth then touches the program 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.660
 continue to be carried out the sad 2 liters of blood are changed 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.000
 and the citizen spy song exactly that makes meter we look down here 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.220
 We pull this one from our songs 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.750
 just on our skin young 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.860
 in the third heathen from the right, we can now change the drivers so we can 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.399
 recognize him well enough to work with now 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.710
 and just no dogma Reflection No that is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.590
 this object is now transparent 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.920
 and now just let 21 miles and pull easier 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 because this should be about as big as the burka under any circumstances 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.510
 no one person was not so big so that the covenant already at the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.830
 Eyes will not even start and now it fits 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.410
 Leave reasons and then Beck can also begin to program 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.910
 but some see that the citizen fits in here and when the middle of the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.030
 Berners in the island of Juist so that the citizens disappear 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.710
 and we do that now too 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.440
 Now we have to start with the World Cup in the first 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 Muck and or Point is quarreling in creating a new outlet 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.660
 and two of these may be a JU Kylie 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.830
 JU and this can now because line was my model on exactly 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.060
 our mouth of the sad smiley is fit that was it again 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.629
 FID Medio Control off and had no save app under 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.200
 in the points other no change 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.410
 and their program we now take with another the eleven of KCI and the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.179
 American Access times when something happens 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:42.069
 then we do that and if that does not happen, that's what makes the other one 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.549
 and what now comes Kaminer 1 and 2 assists again the deficit goals 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.089
 get away teams Korinek 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:53.179
 maybe that in this case the first month over so the court of the 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.750
 kfor-mission that is the whole team 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.100
 this is in this case the looks so our needed 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:04.710
 Respect and when i dream of her friend can write develop there was 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.809
 or more durable point center after that it will continue 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.859
 there we can also crawling for the carpenter Wehr and Bad Orb and ZDF 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.090
 Really, however, that means 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.569
 true point they contain that 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.809
 to be filled out with further things 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.369
 Because of the excessive debt so in the Richtweg that we music the middle of 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.259
 Advisory Board is when I give him just a few registered letters for the attack afterwards 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.190
 is it internal or location? 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.130
 then the whole thing would be done because the edge of the Berners 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.300
 Now our programs can say what is going to happen 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.599
 goes over the command sad point Images as he saddens the picture 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.850
 changes now and that goes petty about the command 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.350
 Jurek the match the people so longed for this picture sad point in the match 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.769
 Now find yourself in the picture you see here 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 can write about this screening and that is in this case 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.760
 Smiley the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.890
 the underlined Happy is still important that you are not just smiley here 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.230
 underlined happy-end writes but Steinmeier League underlined Happy 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.549
 Point PNG because otherwise the program does not find our picture 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.870
 As a last step, we now have a point Eckstein remained 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.180
 tell the program what the moon would be for Falsone h &amp; m 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.240
 Collection is and pull and give up Utl this year 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.669
 as high as poverty is 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.330
 it should even try the whole states and once 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.000
 that there should now be such a protest camp scene and confused 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.680
 Company the middle of the burger 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.530
 pull on this Biju 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.840
 then that Miley changes to our happy ob 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.889
 Now we have this annoying Börgerding left here now 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.169
 disappear and besides we make ours see the red colors lower 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.600
 Invisible to make our program even a little bit prettier 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.150
 we can move here an apprentice 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.510
 that was it and now just 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.849
 and we have that too we can just pull it in the middle 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.030
 and when we put the burger in our smiley mouth 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.940
 then this plaintiff appears chic Megan Textron I write something 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.100
 Congratulations, you could of course also write things 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.729
 as 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.219
 Mirka or 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.629
 they won or should look at the attested games 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.520
 so we can leave that now 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.590
 and now we have to gut the text out then it can save and 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.460
 then in our Yukon Fowler point has a passing and here we still post 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.259
 Another a baseball cap and this time a New Yorker live here 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.610
 we call that 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.199
 But if victory means that we will succeed in our game 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.509
 have played stores and now in the points Mr part 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.629
 and we first saw that our victory was over 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.889
 The Catskill Constance is there in the 5 many things already knows the 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.849
 The victory point of the text is the same he drew quotes above 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.690
 then against Pechstein would want to write as I said I just want to 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.139
 Congratulations a woman dies upstairs 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.349
 Simic or then the program only needs to know which label is the best 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.430
 for the voter in Excel Beeck then shares and rechargeable battery loads Schulz and pull 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.960
 put our victory 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.060
 our Ude sees a life on our label and then we can 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.169
 Try our program again 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.240
 and if we pull the Berger into this field now 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.729
 he seems to have just created ours Maximilian Plück and dies 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.949
 All this BMW once the error that they still went to this Urte indicated 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.629
 will care for the change you just once he went on that 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.669
 third album from the right and let's just take the back of the Bakken 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.759
 it can also be seen a club to the threshing floor with it in excel fixed 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.320
 here guests can recognize 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.320
 but if we start the program again now 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.810
 then you are still no mistake in it nothing remains changed 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:01.959
 But this red was no longer to be seen just as we are 

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:02.740
 imagined 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.289
 you do not have a single problem and our report disappears 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.080
 Such actually be the case when the smiley 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.800
 against Baghdatis then he should then no longer be seen and after 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.690
 Once you get programmed, we go directly to the Yukon Fowler 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:18.979
 Point 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:22.430
 and just write a new line of code and actually knows the the 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.800
 even the burger point goes all fr 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.270
 maybe only seven Kohler and we have that in Lich 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.870
 Schollmeier applied a beer to the index and traded the Envio halfway 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.610
 disappear by simply being made a bit smaller 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.400
 Here it went with 0 and 1 then comes the beginning of July price the dollar 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.999
 hiding is advice Alfa 1 means that you can see the fire 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.589
 and down our entire program from Kaarst Medicine into the area 

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:55.169
 the advertiser disappears the smiley with happy and the text congratulation him 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:55.840
 writes 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.200
 With that he found on the stand of these two total bill I come 

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.630
 Hope the two guys like that I'm lucky enough to learn something about that 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.599
 Whereabouts of objects and how they had with them 

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:12.509
 that was also my name is in the year we see each other thanks to the next 2 2 0
