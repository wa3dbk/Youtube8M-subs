than that everything's good it's nice

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.890 
than that everything's good it's nice
and<00:02:26.340> quiet<00:02:26.430> takes<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> real<00:02:27.150> bark<00:02:27.420> out<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and quiet takes the real bark out of it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.080 
and quiet takes the real bark out of it
I<00:02:28.220> shouldn't<00:02:29.220> say<00:02:29.310> nice<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.639> quiet<00:02:29.849> it's

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
I shouldn't say nice and quiet it's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.910 
I shouldn't say nice and quiet it's
quieter<00:02:30.510> than<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> three<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> half<00:02:31.650> inch

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
quieter than the three and a half inch

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.460 
quieter than the three and a half inch
straight<00:02:32.160> piped<00:02:32.459> with<00:02:33.420> no<00:02:33.720> bark<00:02:34.109> but<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.380> do

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
straight piped with no bark but I do

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.080 
straight piped with no bark but I do
have<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> little<00:02:34.889> bit<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.099> drone<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
have a little bit of drone now so I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.210 
have a little bit of drone now so I
guess<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.870> such<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.319> little<00:02:37.889> bit<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.069> give<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
guess it's such a little bit of give and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
guess it's such a little bit of give and
take
