choppy version of the gunship and these

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.790 
choppy version of the gunship and these
wings<00:03:18.590> do<00:03:18.860> clip<00:03:19.190> into<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.580> sides<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.620> is

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
wings do clip into the sides and that is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.530 
wings do clip into the sides and that is
the<00:03:21.980> underside<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.180> this

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
the underside of that we do have this

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.860 
the underside of that we do have this
switch<00:03:24.140> which<00:03:24.710> is<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:24.890> safety<00:03:25.610> mechanism<00:03:25.870> as

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
switch which is a safety mechanism as

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.500 
switch which is a safety mechanism as
such<00:03:27.350> because<00:03:28.010> once<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.580> hits<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.120> deck<00:03:29.330> it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
such because once this hits the deck it

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.810 
such because once this hits the deck it
pushes<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:30.050> switch<00:03:30.320> up<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.770> it<00:03:31.250> releases<00:03:31.610> the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
pushes up switch up and it releases the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.790 
pushes up switch up and it releases the
safety<00:03:32.360> mechanism<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.170> can<00:03:33.290> fire<00:03:33.770> your

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
safety mechanism so you can fire your

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.880 
safety mechanism so you can fire your
pods<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.690> where<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.020> pods<00:03:36.290> come<00:03:36.620> out

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
pods and that is where the pods come out

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.430 
pods and that is where the pods come out
off<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.000> they<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.170> blue

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
off so they have it you get this blue

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.670 
off so they have it you get this blue
translucent<00:03:40.280> piece<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:41.090> sticks<00:03:41.330> up<00:03:41.680> through

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
translucent piece that sticks up through

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.010 
translucent piece that sticks up through
through<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.220> top<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.060> set<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.960> is

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
through the top of the set and this is

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.930 
through the top of the set and this is
where<00:03:45.290> your<00:03:45.440> pods<00:03:45.740> will<00:03:46.070> go<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.490> can<00:03:46.670> see<00:03:46.820> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
where your pods will go you can see the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.870 
where your pods will go you can see the
pods<00:03:47.180> moving<00:03:48.140> inside<00:03:48.620> there<00:03:48.890> once<00:03:49.610> that's

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
pods moving inside there once that's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.910 
pods moving inside there once that's
down<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.330> base<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.780> we<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:51.020> activated

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
down on the base and we have activated

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.330 
down on the base and we have activated
the<00:03:52.550> safety<00:03:52.970> mechanism<00:03:53.540> your<00:03:54.320> lever<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:55.070> at

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
the safety mechanism your lever is at

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.570 
the safety mechanism your lever is at
the<00:03:55.730> rear<00:03:56.150> here<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.140> too<00:03:57.200> far<00:03:57.710> your<00:03:57.890> pods<00:03:58.250> you

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
the rear here so too far your pods you

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.550 
the rear here so too far your pods you
pull<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> lever<00:03:59.450> back<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.110> see<00:04:00.320> that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
pull the lever back you can see that

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.910 
pull the lever back you can see that
drops<00:04:01.070> then<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.610> pod<00:04:02.050> didn't<00:04:03.050> go<00:04:03.200> into<00:04:03.470> place

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
drops then the pod didn't go into place

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.520 
drops then the pod didn't go into place
until<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.550> let<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.850> go<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.810> shoots<00:04:06.170> off

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
until to let that go and it shoots off

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.450 
until to let that go and it shoots off
your<00:04:07.460> pod<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:08.870> an<00:04:09.140> easy<00:04:09.320> way<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.590> reload<00:04:10.250> this

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
your pod now an easy way to reload this

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.300 
your pod now an easy way to reload this
without<00:04:10.940> taking<00:04:11.540> his<00:04:12.080> top<00:04:12.380> piece<00:04:12.590> off<00:04:12.830> is<00:04:13.100> to

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
without taking his top piece off is to

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.790 
without taking his top piece off is to
drop<00:04:13.520> your<00:04:13.730> pod<00:04:14.000> back<00:04:14.330> inside<00:04:14.750> press<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
drop your pod back inside press that

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.820 
drop your pod back inside press that
switch<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.460> then<00:04:17.299> pull<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.690> back<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.530> then

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
switch and then pull it back and then

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.090 
switch and then pull it back and then
all<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.220> your<00:04:19.790> pods<00:04:20.090> will<00:04:20.870> be<00:04:21.080> back<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.770> place

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
all of your pods will be back in place

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.830 
all of your pods will be back in place
there<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.670> you<00:04:22.760> don't<00:04:23.000> really<00:04:23.240> need<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.480> take

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
there so you don't really need to take
