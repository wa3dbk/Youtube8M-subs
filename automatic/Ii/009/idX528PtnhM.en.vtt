could really make them difficult to work
with<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.790> amateur<00:00:15.240> builder<00:00:15.630> I'm<00:00:16.049> gonna

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
with for the amateur builder I'm gonna

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.290 
with for the amateur builder I'm gonna
give<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:16.710> tips<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.789> hopefully<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
won't run into these problems when you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
won't run into these problems when you
build<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.970> two<00:00:21.119> books<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.630> let's<00:00:22.260> jump<00:00:22.500> right

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
build with two books so let's jump right

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.939 
build with two books so let's jump right
into<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.180> first<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.539> two<00:00:24.930> blogs<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.529> great

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
into it first of all two blogs are great

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
into it first of all two blogs are great
lugs<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:27.410> one<00:00:28.410> major<00:00:28.740> difference<00:00:29.279> between

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
lugs but one major difference between

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.450 
lugs but one major difference between
two<00:00:29.849> blogs<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.449> other<00:00:31.230> kinds<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.949> lugs<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
two blogs and other kinds of lugs is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.990 
two blogs and other kinds of lugs is
this<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.719> moveable<00:00:34.230> insert<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.640> moveable

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
this the moveable insert the moveable

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
this the moveable insert the moveable
insert<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> great<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.129> drill

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
insert is great because when you drill

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
insert is great because when you drill
for<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.879> lug<00:00:39.360> placement<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.370> assemble<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
for your lug placement and assemble it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
for your lug placement and assemble it
all<00:00:41.520> together<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.079> you're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
all together and then when you're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 
all together and then when you're
getting<00:00:43.320> ready<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.800> put<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.190> tension<00:00:44.550> rod<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
getting ready to put your tension rod in

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690 
getting ready to put your tension rod in
it's<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:45.960> easy<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.219> might<00:00:47.550> have

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it's really easy if you might have

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
it's really easy if you might have
drilled<00:00:48.210> let's<00:00:48.629> say<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> couple<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
drilled let's say a couple of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.910 
drilled let's say a couple of
millimeters<00:00:50.309> off<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:51.390> lug<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:51.960> not

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
millimeters off your lug maybe not

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
millimeters off your lug maybe not
exactly<00:00:53.579> 100%<00:00:54.410> placed<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:56.550> drum<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
exactly 100% placed on your drum this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040 
exactly 100% placed on your drum this
movable<00:00:58.410> insert<00:00:58.859> will<00:00:59.160> adjust<00:00:59.969> slightly<00:01:00.420> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
movable insert will adjust slightly so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
movable insert will adjust slightly so
you<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> able<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> screw<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> tension

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you will be able to screw in the tension

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
you will be able to screw in the tension
rod<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:04.080> two<00:01:04.110> blogs<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.770> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
rod with two blogs you don't have that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
rod with two blogs you don't have that
and<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.430> drilling<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.180> blogs<00:01:09.540> your

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and you're drilling for two blogs your

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
and you're drilling for two blogs your
drilling<00:01:10.260> has<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.740> extremely<00:01:11.189> precise

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
drilling has to be extremely precise

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
drilling has to be extremely precise
because<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> moveable

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
looks some lift off of the shell so you

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.010 
looks some lift off of the shell so you
don't<00:01:37.920> end<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.460> having<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:39.210> drum<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> looks

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't end up having a drum that looks

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.160 
don't end up having a drum that looks
like<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.790> as<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.930> not

this<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> bass<00:01:47.009> drum<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.610> used<00:01:48.180> Tom<00:01:48.720> tube

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this was a bass drum that used Tom tube

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.969 
this was a bass drum that used Tom tube
lugs<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.210> third<00:01:51.930> tip<00:01:52.200> do

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
lugs on it and that is my third tip do

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.179 
lugs on it and that is my third tip do
not<00:01:53.009> use<00:01:53.759> Tom<00:01:54.299> tube<00:01:54.689> lugs<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.680> bass<00:01:55.860> drum

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
not use Tom tube lugs on a bass drum
