00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 the group immediately had a question what is it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.830
 so far the residents say 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.840

 bread if translated into Russian so 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.809
 I wrote in the group that all Germans know what 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 a Russian bread and oddly enough 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.420
 Russians make big eyes and ask for 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 Russian bread also I while was Russia 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.579
 until came germany did not know what 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.579
 is Russian 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.020
 when you see such a rabble race 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.380
 Russian bread is certainly surprised that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.830
 it is but what it looks like 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.960
 a pack of 125 grams there is 25 grams of bonus then 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.350
 There are 100 grams mostly sold 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.619
 such here almost and this Russian ford 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 he shaped latin letters 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.970
 farm alphabet form but such 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.180
 bulk pack weighs 100 grams 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 tell and the composition of this bread in general he 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.910
 is made from protein from proteins that is 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.840
 whipped whites together in sugar and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.580
 cocoa and shut up bastards after that 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.940
 they water 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.259
 sugar coating that is varnish it all 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.259
 must be sweet 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:06.520
 here are there 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:13.600
 small letters here are so thin heart 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.600
 you tingling drove to her 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.340
 such small ones I don't know how 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 to name 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.530
 gingerbread or loaves I thought they would 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.900
 brilliant eyes too offers itself in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.060
 some forest 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.700
 I think they will be more like this 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.210
 here they look 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.910
 show it we have bubbles 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.220
 yes that is whipped cream added there 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.860
 cocoa 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:57.000
 whipped cream oh whipped whipped protein 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:59.720
 whipped protein with cocoa without 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.720
 the call 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.200
 crazy sweet really want 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.050
 here I read they contain 50 grams 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:26.360
 sugar per 100 grams of product that is 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:30.290
 my opinion is very sweet for my taste 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.110
 very sweet here is such a Russian ford 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.170
 and also in the group described what exists 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.420
 several versions why is it called 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.460
 exactly Russian ford on why in Russia 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.000
 Russians don't know anything about this 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.940
 of the versions sounds as follows 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.780
 way that drain danske baker 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.460
 brought in 1844 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.480
 The recipe of this Rusich wire from 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.030
 St. Petersburg 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.630
 after that he opened in his town 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.940
 they are not boring bakery and bake there 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:07.040
 russisch ford for the first time Vienna considered that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.070
 Russian bread was coined there 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.350
 19th century for the reception of the Russian ambassador 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.200
 as the Russians welcome guests with 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.750
 bread while the bread and salt but 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.420
 Austrians felt that they only met 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.390
 bread and baked here is a Russian bread 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.670
 although to our custom to meet guests 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.890
 By bread and salt I think it is as little as 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.890
 relates to meet just such a bread 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.270
 but he is very weak and manufacturer 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.169
 the balm which was made here 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.110
 this thruster pond they have their own version 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:51.490
 name you trud ford that she went 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.700
 cut chosen cut out it means whip 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.000
 proverbs toys crisp ford it means 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.570
 star buck thieves ie sweet sweet 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.550
 bakery products 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.060
 that is, it turns out that the old German 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.350
 name cut and rabble which means 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.900

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.639
 crispy pastry which of these three 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.550
 versions believable 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.400
 as I wrote about VKontakte we probably 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.100
 we will not know, but there are such versions though 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.870
 as I told the Russians nothing 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.320
 know that there is such a Russian 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.220
 ford 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.110
