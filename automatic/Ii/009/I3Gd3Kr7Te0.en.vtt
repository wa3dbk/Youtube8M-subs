00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:28.040 

probably<00:06:21.510> be<00:06:21.720> called

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.309 

and<00:06:28.379> that's<00:06:28.830> uploading<00:06:29.400> now<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.330> second<00:06:30.840> step

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
and that's uploading now the second step

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.050 
and that's uploading now the second step
in<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.560> last<00:06:31.830> step<00:06:32.099> is<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.400> add<00:06:32.520> a<00:06:32.550> single<00:06:32.879> line

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
in the last step is to add a single line

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.570 
in the last step is to add a single line
of<00:06:33.210> code<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.780> your<00:06:33.840> website<00:06:33.960> source<00:06:34.710> code<00:06:35.009> so
