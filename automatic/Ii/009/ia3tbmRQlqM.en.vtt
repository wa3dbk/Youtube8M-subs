00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that's where that's where I think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
that's where that's where I think
coaches<00:01:53.369> take<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.420> too<00:01:54.479> far<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
coaches take it way too far right and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.819 
coaches take it way too far right and
and<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> show<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.530> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and and so what the show I think is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
and and so what the show I think is
really<00:01:59.159> gonna<00:01:59.310> show<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.240> bunch<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.840> these

it's<00:04:04.980> not<00:04:05.129> that<00:04:05.400> important<00:04:05.849> because<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.269> game

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
it's not that important because the game

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.449 
it's not that important because the game
is<00:04:06.659> still<00:04:06.840> being<00:04:06.900> played<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:08.069> have<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.340> move

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
is still being played so we have to move

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.289 
is still being played so we have to move
