00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
let start with the front so I've had

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.380 
let start with the front so I've had
these<00:00:22.769> Floor<00:00:23.220> Liners<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.240> months

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
these Floor Liners for about two months

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.779 
these Floor Liners for about two months
now<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.590> say<00:00:25.800> by<00:00:26.130> far<00:00:26.430> it's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
now and I would have to say by far it's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
now and I would have to say by far it's
probably<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> best<00:00:28.109> investments

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
probably one of the best investments

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
probably one of the best investments
that<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.730> pretty<00:00:30.090> much<00:00:30.210> any<00:00:30.480> car

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that I got for it pretty much any car

that I got for it pretty much any car
that<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.199> owned<00:00:31.410> there's<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that I have owned there's actually a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
that I have owned there's actually a
very<00:00:32.850> useful<00:00:33.210> investment<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> guys<00:00:34.350> have

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
very useful investment if you guys have

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.569 
very useful investment if you guys have
a<00:00:34.770> new<00:00:34.950> car

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
a new car

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
a new car
you<00:00:36.300> carry<00:00:36.570> people<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.260> live<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> dirty

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you carry people you live in dirty

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400 
you carry people you live in dirty
environments<00:00:38.460> wet<00:00:38.790> whatnot<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
environments wet whatnot it's actually I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
environments wet whatnot it's actually I
think<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.920> lot<00:00:41.100> better<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.059> factory<00:00:42.510> or

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
think a lot better than the factory or

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
think a lot better than the factory or
the<00:00:42.840> dealer<00:00:43.500> um<00:00:43.739> floor<00:00:44.460> liners<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.000> example

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the dealer um floor liners for example

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
the dealer um floor liners for example
the<00:00:45.629> Toyota<00:00:45.899> ones<00:00:46.140> fill<00:00:46.829> reasons<00:00:47.129> why<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.309> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the Toyota ones fill reasons why you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
the Toyota ones fill reasons why you can
see<00:00:47.760> you'll<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> WeatherTech<00:00:48.960> it

the only thing I did notice was the
edges<00:01:31.110> pop<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.710> believe<00:01:32.040> everybody<00:01:32.369> who's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
edges pop out I believe everybody who's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.190 
edges pop out I believe everybody who's
bought<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> floor<00:01:33.390> liner<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> same

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
bought the floor liner has the same

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
bought the floor liner has the same
problem<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.850> California<00:01:36.450> hasn't

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
problem right now in California hasn't

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
problem right now in California hasn't
been<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> warmest<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.829> been<00:01:37.950> kind<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
been the warmest so it's been kind of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
been the warmest so it's been kind of
cool<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.540> Floor<00:01:39.780> Liners<00:01:40.049> haven't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
cool so these are Floor Liners haven't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
cool so these are Floor Liners haven't
had<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> chance<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:40.860> warm<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.670> get

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
had a chance to actually warm up and get
soft<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> guys<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> heat<00:01:43.200> gun<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.680> used

you<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.570> heat<00:01:45.810> gun<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.409> actually

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you have a heat gun you can actually

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.380 
you have a heat gun you can actually
take<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> floor<00:01:47.250> liner<00:01:47.430> heat<00:01:48.240> the

take out the floor liner heat the
section<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.200> bit<00:01:49.350> with

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
section will be here a little bit with

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
section will be here a little bit with
the<00:01:49.560> heat<00:01:49.770> gun<00:01:49.799> warm<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.000> gets<00:01:51.119> kind

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the heat gun warm it up so it gets kind

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.910 
the heat gun warm it up so it gets kind
of<00:01:51.329> soft<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> reflux<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
of soft and then just kind of reflux it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.260 
of soft and then just kind of reflux it
back<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.700> install<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:53.970> they

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
back out and when you install it they

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
back out and when you install it they
will<00:01:54.450> sit<00:01:54.689> flush<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
will sit flush as you can see it's not a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
will sit flush as you can see it's not a
big<00:01:56.610> issue<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.110> things

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
big issue it's just one of those things

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.330 
big issue it's just one of those things
when<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> compact<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.219> actually

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
when the compact this was actually

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.889 
when the compact this was actually
folded<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> believe<00:02:00.780> this

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
folded up a little bit so I believe this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
folded up a little bit so I believe this
is<00:02:00.960> why<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.259> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> pops<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.460> way

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
is why it kind of pops out just the way

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.310 
is why it kind of pops out just the way
there'd<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> impact<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.110> even

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
there'd be impact you can see you even

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.410 
there'd be impact you can see you even
have<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.369> locks<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.149> mats

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
have the little locks here so these mats

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.270 
have the little locks here so these mats
are<00:02:06.509> never<00:02:06.689> slide<00:02:06.960> up<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.469> stuck<00:02:07.740> unto

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

contours down a little bit as the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.319 
contours down a little bit as the

so it's very nice I've actually made
this<00:04:06.450> higher<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.290> actually<00:04:07.440> level<00:04:07.980> but

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
this higher so it's actually level but

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.370 
this higher so it's actually level but
this<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.760> contoured<00:04:09.510> down<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.079> just<00:04:10.230> keeps

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
this is contoured down so it just keeps

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.920

the<00:07:00.900> floor<00:07:01.290> liner<00:07:01.560> I<00:07:01.680> believe<00:07:01.920> so<00:07:02.070> do<00:07:02.190> some

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
the floor liner I believe so do some

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.620

research make sure you buy the actual
one<00:07:03.900> cuz<00:07:04.140> I<00:07:04.170> believe<00:07:04.380> they<00:07:04.470> have<00:07:04.620> two

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
one cuz I believe they have two

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.220 
one cuz I believe they have two
different<00:07:05.220> ones<00:07:05.490> once<00:07:06.240> a<00:07:06.360> floor<00:07:06.600> mat<00:07:06.810> and<00:07:07.020> once

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
different ones once a floor mat and once

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.930 
different ones once a floor mat and once
a<00:07:07.320> floor<00:07:07.590> liner<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:08.100> floor<00:07:08.370> liner<00:07:08.550> actually

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
a floor liner the floor liner actually

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.580 
a floor liner the floor liner actually
lines<00:07:09.120> with<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.330> whole<00:07:09.480> floor<00:07:09.750> and<00:07:09.960> it<00:07:10.380> kind

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
lines with the whole floor and it kind

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.170 
lines with the whole floor and it kind
of<00:07:10.620> curves<00:07:10.890> up<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.280> little<00:07:11.430> bit<00:07:11.610> to<00:07:11.730> contain

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
of curves up a little bit to contain

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.430 
of curves up a little bit to contain
because<00:07:12.480> it's<00:07:12.660> pretty<00:07:12.750> much<00:07:12.900> like<00:07:13.020> a<00:07:13.140> liner

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
because it's pretty much like a liner
