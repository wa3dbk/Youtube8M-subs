first<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.910> move<00:00:33.210> air

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
first thing we have to do is to move air

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
first thing we have to do is to move air
housing<00:00:35.059> air<00:00:36.059> cleaner<00:00:36.510> housing<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.230> side

housing air cleaner housing to the side

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.280 
housing air cleaner housing to the side
for<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.059> remove<00:00:39.329> three<00:00:39.960> nuts

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
for that we have to remove three nuts

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.610 
for that we have to remove three nuts
that<00:00:40.860> hold<00:00:41.100> housing<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> body<00:00:42.469> which<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that hold housing to the body which is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.209 
that hold housing to the body which is
one<00:00:43.829> night<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:45.140> another<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.530> little

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
one night here another one little

further and one between the housing and
radiator<00:00:50.879> support<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
radiator support so when we're going to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.119 
radiator support so when we're going to
move<00:00:53.340> housing<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> side<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:55.410> careful<00:00:55.440> not

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
move housing to the side be careful not

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
move housing to the side be careful not
to<00:00:56.340> break<00:00:56.550> wires<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> air<00:00:57.690> control

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to break wires for the air control

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.760 
to break wires for the air control
sensor<00:01:00.530> okay

now<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.270> their<00:01:07.369> module<00:01:08.369> assembly

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
now we can see their module assembly

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.460 
now we can see their module assembly
sitting<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> hydraulic<00:01:10.619> unit<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:13.260> have

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
sitting on a hydraulic unit so we have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
sitting on a hydraulic unit so we have
to<00:01:13.710> lose<00:01:14.159> two<00:01:14.850> nuts<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.860> holding<00:01:16.860> hydraulic

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to lose two nuts that holding hydraulic

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.289 
to lose two nuts that holding hydraulic
unit<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> bracket<00:01:19.280> okay<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.759> when<00:01:21.150> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
unit to the bracket okay and when we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
unit to the bracket okay and when we
lose<00:01:21.479> those<00:01:21.960> nuts<00:01:22.790> we're<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.180> able

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lose those nuts we're going to be able

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
lose those nuts we're going to be able
to<00:01:25.340> lift<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.060> whole<00:01:27.090> unit<00:01:27.890> from<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> bracket

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to lift the whole unit from the bracket

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
to lift the whole unit from the bracket
and<00:01:30.560> hold<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> securely<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.320> next

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and hold it securely right here the next

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
and hold it securely right here the next
step<00:01:34.829> we're<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> remove<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
step we're going to do is to remove the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.039 
step we're going to do is to remove the
main<00:01:37.470> wiring<00:01:38.210> connection<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> come<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
main wiring connection that come to the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.609 
main wiring connection that come to the
module<00:01:40.729> move<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> side<00:01:42.439> we're<00:01:43.439> going

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
module move it to the side we're going

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.649 
module move it to the side we're going
to<00:01:43.710> remove<00:01:43.950> small<00:01:44.250> wiring<00:01:44.939> connections<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to remove small wiring connections that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
to remove small wiring connections that
comes<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> module<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> button<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
comes to the module on the button and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.569 
comes to the module on the button and
move<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.329> side<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.189> then<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.399> going

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
move it to the side and then we're going

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
move it to the side and then we're going
to<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.180> remove<00:01:52.079> six<00:01:53.040> screws<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:55.290> hold

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to have to remove six screws that hold

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.130 
to have to remove six screws that hold
the<00:01:56.070> module

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the module

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.320 
the module
so<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.070> hydraulic<00:01:58.700> unit<00:01:59.060> itself<00:02:03.640> after<00:02:04.640> you

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
so the hydraulic unit itself after you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.990 
so the hydraulic unit itself after you
removing<00:02:05.810> all<00:02:06.020> six<00:02:06.650> screws<00:02:07.070> you're<00:02:07.730> going<00:02:07.910> to
