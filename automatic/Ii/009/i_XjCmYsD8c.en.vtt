automation this is done through MTS

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.249 
automation this is done through MTS
system<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:18.430> have<00:01:18.640> both<00:01:18.909> without<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
system we have both without we have the

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
system we have both without we have the
tracks<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.830> middle<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.340> run<00:01:21.970> on<00:01:22.000> MTS<00:01:23.190> the

tracks in the middle are run on MTS the
outside<00:01:25.210> tracks<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.869> were<00:01:26.020> using<00:01:26.229> LG<00:01:27.190> B's<00:01:27.430> EPL

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
outside tracks we were using LG B's EPL

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.600 
outside tracks we were using LG B's EPL
system<00:01:28.960> with<00:01:29.619> magnets<00:01:30.070> on<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.220> bottom<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
system with magnets on the bottom the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.120 
system with magnets on the bottom the
locomotives<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.450> Reed<00:01:31.630> switches<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.770> then

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
locomotives and Reed switches and then

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.460 
locomotives and Reed switches and then
with<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.460> signal<00:01:33.850> signal<00:01:34.330> blocks<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.320> we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
with the signal signal blocks so we're

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.440 
with the signal signal blocks so we're
actually<00:01:35.649> starting<00:01:36.399> starting<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.240> stopping

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
actually starting starting and stopping

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.279 
actually starting starting and stopping
the<00:01:37.720> trains<00:01:38.100> based<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:40.020> location<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
the trains based on location on the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.469 
the trains based on location on the
layout<00:01:41.619> ok<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.429> one<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:43.000> that's<00:01:43.119> kind<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
layout ok so that one so that's kind of

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
layout ok so that one so that's kind of
like<00:01:43.630> automated<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.679> then<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.100> inside<00:01:45.460> one

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
like automated and then the inside one

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.010 
like automated and then the inside one
you<00:01:45.759> can<00:01:45.880> actually<00:01:46.030> have<00:01:46.330> people<00:01:46.600> running<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you can actually have people running the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.109 
you can actually have people running the
trains<00:01:47.289> that<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.800> correct<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.460> noticed<00:01:49.030> that

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
trains that is correct I noticed that

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.880 
trains that is correct I noticed that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
decoders in it but we have automated he

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.850 
decoders in it but we have automated he
started<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.560> year<00:02:11.800> ago<00:02:12.600> had<00:02:13.600> drawn<00:02:14.170> up<00:02:14.200> detailed
