00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 and hello to all friends with you here and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.670
 Today we will consider not one but whole 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 three young minecraft two of which 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.059
 addict one more or less 1000 and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.100
 let's get down and consider two 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.890
 addicted fashionable and one on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
 realistic but it will be later 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.449
 I will tell you first how to make such 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.369
 drug addict and this is all very 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.789
 you just need only two kinds 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.859
 wool i will take red black and we 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.309
 it turns out such a red and black 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.559
 wool 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.870
 staggeringly you can 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 put anywhere that is all 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 ok so i want to show you 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.550
 how much wool does this mod add 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.020
 he just is just a colossal 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 the amount they probably tried 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.739
 all variations of possible combinations 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.870
 wool and it is very much so you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.870
 can do pixel hordes or whatever you 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 there want to do with this wool 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.460
 2 mod allows you to repaint boards 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.390
 or iron boards repaint devils 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.650
 very easy 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.299
 you need only one oak board with 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.220
 head and tropical or birch 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.830
 the board does not work 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.680
 take any dye I'll take red and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.140
 we have a red poison board all 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.509
 easy and with iron already a little bit 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.250
 more difficult because we need 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.240
 grind first 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 one iron ingot into this crumb after 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 what in a crumb there is no sense crumb iron 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 mug and repaint this iron mug 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.650
 we get a red iron crumb 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.299
 and then you should melt it and 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 how does it get us out 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.610
 red bar well let's look at 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.330
 example of iron ingots like this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 get us here let's say blue sword 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.270
 it is blue than if it is blue 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.220
 but it is also very clear then you can 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.240
 make yourself armor and well whatever you want 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.950
 the next mod and this we have more 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 realistic can because he 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.650
 It allows you to craft from conventional foliage 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.990
 and paper that is, you take paper from 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.310
 so forest 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.930
 well is the hollies you can do 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.260
 paper from such a sheet you can make 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.230
 paper meaning you can make yourself 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.740
 paper and it seems to me of course micro 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 dualistic but still estate when 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.890
 looks like reality 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.190
 because plain paper is from what 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.100
 made of wood right it is like 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.160
 part of the tree foliage but as if slightly 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.480
 yes realistic well that's all if you 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.340
 liked this video then you can 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.710
 like to call friends 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.980
 subscribe and swami was a certain move to everyone 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.980
