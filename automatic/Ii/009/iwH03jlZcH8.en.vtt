00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
trying to figure out how to do that how

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.920 
trying to figure out how to do that how
do<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> feel<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> portrayed

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
Jesus maybe Connor you can well I think

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.850 
Jesus maybe Connor you can well I think
in<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.280> movie<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.939> though<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.590> don't

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
in this movie even though you don't

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.179 
in this movie even though you don't
really<00:01:56.250> see<00:01:56.549> Jesus<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.719> either<00:01:58.590> his

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
really see Jesus you just see either his

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.580 
really see Jesus you just see either his
body<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.810> painting<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> end

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
body or you see the painting at the end

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
body or you see the painting at the end
I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.570> very<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.640> his

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I think that he is very know that his

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.449 
I think that he is very know that his
name<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.459> entire<00:02:08.849> film<00:02:09.410> because<00:02:10.459> even

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
though he only appears for a short time

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.350 
though he only appears for a short time
in<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
in the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.380 
in the
he<00:02:15.360> has<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.709> most<00:02:16.740> impacts<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.849> their

questioning with the church was you know
is<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.680> because<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> lot<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
is this you know because a lot of the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.400 
is this you know because a lot of the
church<00:02:30.569> today<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.080> Western<00:02:31.380> world

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
church today in the Western world

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 
church today in the Western world
doesn't<00:02:31.980> understand<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
doesn't understand that you know the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.080 
doesn't understand that you know the
supernatural<00:02:34.110> elements<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.060> lot

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
supernatural elements or I think a lot

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.500 
supernatural elements or I think a lot
of<00:02:36.209> people<00:02:36.300> try<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> downplay<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.470> which<00:02:37.709> is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
of people try to downplay that which is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.850 
of people try to downplay that which is
unfortunate<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.019> church<00:02:40.260> would<00:02:40.470> slide

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
unfortunate that the church would slide

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.650 
unfortunate that the church would slide
so<00:02:41.130> far<00:02:41.400> away<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.730> where<00:02:42.000> God<00:02:42.239> wants<00:02:42.569> us<00:02:42.600> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so far away from where God wants us to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.660 
so far away from where God wants us to
be<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.349> true<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:45.180> i<00:02:45.209> think<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.540> know

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
be but that's true but i think you know

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.150 
be but that's true but i think you know
in<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> film<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.720> compressed<00:02:49.230> time<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.830> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
in the film they compressed time and so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.949 
in the film they compressed time and so
a<00:02:50.459> lot<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.880> things<00:02:51.090> coming<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.569> has<00:02:51.720> come

came<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> lot<00:02:52.560> faster<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:53.130> us<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.370> film<00:02:53.670> than

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
came a lot faster at us in the film than

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
came a lot faster at us in the film than
in<00:02:54.000> real<00:02:54.180> life<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:55.170> everything<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.010> is
