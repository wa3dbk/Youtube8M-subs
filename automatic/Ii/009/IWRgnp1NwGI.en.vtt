00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.709
 because here yet so we have as yet 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.300
 I believe that anyway with the ff13 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.520
 steelbook at was it so once 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.830
 a postcard or a good wine list 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.470
 behind, yes, nothing looks too 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.240
 very nice 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.560
 I have received mine 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.000
 welded box but now I can 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 I look at the roma so very much 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.300
 cool 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.950
 then I have that too 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.490
 little booklet that was in it 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.520
 Episode 1 where I believe exactly where 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.370
 story actors the after ff13 and before that 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.970
 13 2 happens or so if I am myself 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.890
 not mistaken 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.920
 this is a lot of text all well 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.150
 in german which is very cool and yes 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.590
 You can then go through this way 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.240
 read and sometimes a little bit more 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.140
 I really like the story too 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.540
 and yes that is I think I can between 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.300
 The two play very cool thank you 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.920
 for so and then I was thinking here of us 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.390
 actually, but before I go 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.130
 I still have something to come 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.280
 i believe that and drawings in 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.470

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.100
 and no these are selected pictures 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.130
 I think so here we have one 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.530
 good picture of sora of kingdom hearts 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.120

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.919

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.430

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.190

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.500

 We definitely up there we go 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.669
 that already for others wants to insist 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.830
 and then there will have his place 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.130
 thank you so much for that and now we come 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.280

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.540
 what wanted to send to the and yes the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.910
 Rest was just a bonus 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.729
 Things are about kingdom hearts 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.220
 3d dream drop distance and that around the 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.900
 ar cards that look like that are just 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.940
 not really cards but that's yes 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.830
 so imprinted and you will find that 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.330
 as far as I know I know now too 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.860
 not exactly like that is because he is very much for 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.689
 already used his game 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.889
 that could still take with me 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.360
 are you too because you can be here too 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.719
 but it is good that it is not good 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.009
 have done or if I then stop my 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.770

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.360
 But many thanks for that 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.919

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.069

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.870
 So it looks like keeping a little bit now 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.849

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.129
 back of one and the front 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.229
 the other card so I know even 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.669
 not exactly what they are for that they are 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.800
 At least I have no idea about that 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.210
 and that's just from this one outside 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.159
 I do not know exactly how the beings 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.719
 but they are the ones he helps to travel 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.699
 play and somehow in a team or 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.319
 But I do not know that anymore 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.330
 but thank you very much 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.840
