00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so now we're going to set it up so that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.790 
so now we're going to set it up so that
this<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.799> room<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.670> inch<00:00:14.969> pulley

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
this has room for that five inch pulley

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.260 
this has room for that five inch pulley
well<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.279> two<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> half<00:00:17.789> inches

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
well I know it's two and a half inches

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.099 
well I know it's two and a half inches
from<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> center<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.260> five<00:00:19.619> inch<00:00:19.890> pulley<00:00:21.109> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
from the center of a five inch pulley so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.830 
from the center of a five inch pulley so
I've<00:00:22.230> got<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.590> blocks<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:23.480> water<00:00:24.480> running

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
I've got some blocks out water running

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.330 
I've got some blocks out water running
here

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.690

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.830 
all right so what we got bought a two
inch<00:00:40.910> pulley<00:00:41.180> for<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.780> three<00:00:42.020> quarter<00:00:42.260> shaft

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
inch pulley for this three quarter shaft

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:54.910 
inch pulley for this three quarter shaft
and<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:48.580> 6<00:00:49.580> inch<00:00:49.820> pulling<00:00:52.180> for<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:54.650> winch

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and a 6 inch pulling for the winch

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.540 
and a 6 inch pulling for the winch
itself<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.620> what<00:00:57.739> we're<00:00:57.860> gonna<00:00:57.980> do<00:00:58.220> now<00:00:58.520> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
itself so what we're gonna do now is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.080 
itself so what we're gonna do now is
we're<00:00:59.000> gonna<00:00:59.090> weld<00:00:59.330> these<00:00:59.570> on<00:00:59.840> here<00:01:00.880> because<00:01:01.880> I

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
we're gonna weld these on here because I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.480 
we're gonna weld these on here because I
want<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:04.660> bushings<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:06.350> bearings<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.190> pull

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
want the bushings the bearings to pull

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.160 
want the bushings the bearings to pull
against<00:01:07.880> something<00:01:09.009> instead<00:01:10.009> of<00:01:10.070> pull<00:01:10.610> on

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
against something instead of pull on

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.999 
against something instead of pull on
themselves<00:01:13.900> all<00:01:14.900> right<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.590> got<00:01:15.830> these

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
universal so this is a half-inch impact

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.600 
universal so this is a half-inch impact
Universal<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.979> three<00:02:10.190> quarter

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
Universal and this is a three quarter

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.150 
Universal and this is a three quarter
inch<00:02:10.640> impact<00:02:11.349> Universal<00:02:12.349> they're<00:02:12.980> also

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
inch impact Universal they're also

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.089 
inch impact Universal they're also
called<00:02:13.550> wobble<00:02:14.090> sockets<00:02:14.870> all<00:02:15.709> right<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
called wobble sockets all right the

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.240 
called wobble sockets all right the
half-inch<00:02:16.730> drive<00:02:17.530> great<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:19.040> took<00:02:19.190> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
half-inch drive great then I just took a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.740 
half-inch drive great then I just took a
regular<00:02:19.459> Roy<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> had<00:02:20.390> laying<00:02:20.660> around<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
regular Roy that I had laying around and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.030 
regular Roy that I had laying around and
filed<00:02:24.430> or<00:02:25.430> ground<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.660> ends<00:02:27.170> into<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.770> half

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
filed or ground the ends into the half

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.610 
filed or ground the ends into the half
inch<00:02:28.340> square<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.330> half<00:02:29.540> inch<00:02:29.810> steel<00:02:30.380> dowel

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
inch square it's half inch steel dowel

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.030 
inch square it's half inch steel dowel
so<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> was<00:02:31.490> able<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.760> put<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> half<00:02:32.240> inch<00:02:33.040> square

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
so I was able to put a half inch square

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.319 
so I was able to put a half inch square
end<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.750> okay<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:36.590> put<00:02:36.769> them<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.209> take<00:02:38.209> the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
end on it okay just put them on take the

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.250 
end on it okay just put them on take the
drive<00:02:38.540> shaft<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:39.110> just

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
drive shaft out just

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.830 
drive shaft out just
wobbling<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.730> got<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> wobble<00:02:42.599> back<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
wobbling it's got a wobble back and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.649 
wobbling it's got a wobble back and
forth<00:02:43.459> alright<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.790> allows<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.420> have

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
forth alright that allows it to have
