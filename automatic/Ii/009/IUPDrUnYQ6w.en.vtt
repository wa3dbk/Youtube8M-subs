00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.690
 now it is very important 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.210
 that you take 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.660
 a lot of attention to how we're going to do the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 braid 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.640
 we have said that this is the line of 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.520
 hair that we are going to braid 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.040
 we are going to braid how super important 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.430
 this area where we are going to start the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.430
 braid 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.900
 to prevent that you also have to 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.900
 do what we are going to do right now 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.119
 our synthetic hair 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 right now I have used a very hair 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.390
 different to our client's hair 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 in this case so you can see how it is done 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.729
 the braid normally when you go to 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.009
 to make a client use a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.640
 hair similar to that of the client but 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.220
 never the same can she use it this 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.680
 has light brown hair 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.810
 has light brown hair that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.960
 I could put black hair down 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 example never so platinum is a hair 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.890
 too clear is a lot 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 difference but for example for this 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.420
 hair type because a black hair 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.090
 it would be fine but you never have to 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 put it the same color and then you 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.810
 I will explain why 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.930
 he takes his hair 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.170
 and what we do we take it as it is 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.940
 we see here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.070
 then now 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.100
 we take the hair and put it down 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.220
 above the row with which we are going to 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.600
 to work 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.440
 we put it over 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.440
 and we take 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 our little finger and our finger 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.330
 cancel 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.410
 we take this out in this way 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.410
 thus 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.920
 and we have these two fingers left free to 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.810
 hold the first hairline of the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.440
 customer 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.880
 Now what we do is with our fingers 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.400
 little finger and ring finger of our right hand 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.880
 pass them below and with these two 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.940
 fingers the thumb and forefinger of the hand 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.940
 left we will pick up that hair 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.760
 this is how we have stayed 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.650
 Ok now what we have to do is 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.650
 with the customer's hair 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.550
 this has to be very clean 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.560
 and now we have 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.520
 two ends east 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.520
 and this 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.060
 and this one that has a synthetic hair and 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.610
 he only has client's hair 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 that would make our braid not 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:11.800
 were fully so to speak 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.819
 strong in all its ends then what 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.570
 what are we going to do now is catch 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.930
 our braid will be completely 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.600
 balanced 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 we take another clamp so that we do not 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.229
 bother the hairs 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.539
 The more straight the hair is, the more we 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.200
 annoying the more curly the more Afro much 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.770
 less 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.770
 we braid 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.180
 we are taking a little bit 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.180
 but 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.710
 and we are rewarding 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.850
 the braid has to be well secured 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 but never tight 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.950
 and not provoke him 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.200
 to the client what is called alopecia 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.960
 by traction 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.969
 that is when the braids are very 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.689
 tight 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.689
 we are advancing 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.560
 we continue braiding 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.560
 a little bit 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.949
 i 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.130
 to me
