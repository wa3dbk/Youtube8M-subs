00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
further into the process what I'll do is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.149 
further into the process what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:20.640> lift<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.270> whisk<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.710> fall<00:01:22.950> into

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I'll lift my whisk and it will fall into

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
I'll lift my whisk and it will fall into
a<00:01:23.310> continuous<00:01:24.090> stream<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.290> I'll<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
a continuous stream and all I'll have to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
a continuous stream and all I'll have to
do<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> run<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.580> finger<00:01:27.150> through<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> stream

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
do is run my finger through the stream

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.499 
do is run my finger through the stream
and<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> rub<00:01:29.430> my<00:01:29.610> fingers<00:01:29.939> together<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and when I rub my fingers together I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
and when I rub my fingers together I
won't<00:01:30.630> feel<00:01:30.840> any<00:01:31.049> sugar<00:01:31.350> granules<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> that's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
won't feel any sugar granules and that's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
won't feel any sugar granules and that's
how<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.840> egg<00:01:33.990> white<00:01:34.350> mixture<00:01:34.380> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
how I know that the egg white mixture is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
how I know that the egg white mixture is
ready<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> next<00:01:35.670> process<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.009> you

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you do not stop because the sugar will

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
you do not stop because the sugar will
then<00:02:08.190> harden<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.879> you'll<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> start<00:02:09.569> all
