00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 weather extremes become normal and 12 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 year old I'm shot and philipp 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.570
 the diva flash news it's too late that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.040
 The World Bank shared in its report the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.870
 heat down the new climate 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.950
 see normality in the eye with in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.540
 report it came to the follow the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.529
 climate change such as heat 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.490
 and the rise of the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.289
 sea ​​levels 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.119
 these are neither unstoppable nor 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 to be reversed rather belonged 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.289
 you now to our reality itself 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 if you have the emission of greenhouse gases 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.529
 could drastically reduce the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359
 previous climate catastrophes not 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.560
 but you have to undo as 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.719
 normal grade 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 that means you have to expect that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.530
 these occur regularly and more frequently 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 since the industrial revolution 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 the temperatures on average by about 0.8 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.390
 Celsius has risen 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.649
 In the next century you have to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 expect that the sea level 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.219
 will increase steadily 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 every region of the earth will be followed by the consequences 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.710
 of climate change are affected 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 it will be particularly bad people 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 Meet in regions where several live 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.110
 climate impacts come together that's about 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.030
 to expect everything in the warm countries 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 and is expected so why even 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.649
 very poor people meet eg in the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 World Bank President Kim said 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 that one is now determined against one 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.900
 global warming in this century 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.700
 should proceed up to four degrees at 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.439
 UN climate summit in Paris next year 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.869
 should be a new binding agreement for 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.460
 the time after 2020 will be closed 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.450
 this is supposed to reduce global warming below two 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.950
 currently hold the five degrees 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.659
 un-veto powers and germany with the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.200
 Iran on a new nuclear program for the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.000
 Iran 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
 the deadline expires midnight today 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.270
 have been consulting since thursday 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 foreign minister john kerry and the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.750
 Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamed Cherif 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 since yesterday are also the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 Foreign Minister of Russia China 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.299
 Great britain france in germany 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.740
 with an agreement you can before 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.240
 Expiration of the deadline but probably 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 The US government did not achieve it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 known in concrete terms is the extent to which 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 Iran should limit its nuclear program 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.759
 or will the countries demand that the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.110
 nuclear activities so reduced 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.299
 that will be the construction of nuclear weapons 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.560
 becomes impossible if your agrees 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.850
 the participating countries want the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.659
 economic sanctions against the country 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.280
 cancel 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.380
 The Iranian leadership gave to the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920
 use and that the atomic program is not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.540
 should be restricted as far as 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.829
 required by other countries before 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.360
 a year had the participating countries 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.229
 already a provisional agreement 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.090
 closed 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.220
 this one looked within a half 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.959
 sign a follow-up contract 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.260
 but that did not work out was why 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.330
 ran 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.860
 is already up to 24 november this 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.299
 year extended as it currently 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.689
 looks like today, too 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.280
 Negotiations go into the extension 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.870
 Cleveland in Ohio turned into yesterday 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.459
 12 year old boy of police officers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.420
 shot dead in the hospital 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.439
 his injuries 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 the boy had a playground 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.310
 a toy gun then pulled 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 a witness told the police and 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 pointed out that the concerned 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.069
 person probably a teenager 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.629
 and the weapon probably not real 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.370
 this was the two local officials 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.750
 but does not communicate as she does 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.519
 Young calling on the hands to lift 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.170
 he grabbed his pants waistband 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.549
 his weapon without her but directly on 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.069
 to direct the police 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.209
 then one of the police fired 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.530
 usually toy weapons have the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.760
 look very real oranges 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.680
 markings in turn 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.150
 symbolize that they are harmless 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.099
 But this was at night is young 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 the case could have been new 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.459
 riots triggered because just in ferguson 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.379
 the decision is expected if the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.180
 policeman guilty in wilson because 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.379
 he in august in afro american michael 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.090
 had shot brown 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.769
 is precarious that it is in the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.720
 killed twelve year old also around 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.340
 a black trades the case ferres 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.290
 and led to several protest marches 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.579
 ravings of the region what exactly is with 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.379
 you have the case here 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.060
 see and like such events 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.319
 be clearly clarified in the future 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.299
 you can learn here 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.160
 Do you believe that in the future more 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.269
 To be expecting extreme weather writes 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.930
 We would like your opinion in the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.220
 Comments 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.480
 those were the areas for today i am 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.480
 out and a nice week looked
