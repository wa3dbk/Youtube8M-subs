00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
stands there and not only does this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.910 
stands there and not only does this
allow<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.640> player<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.899> other<00:00:54.930> team<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.680> get

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209 
allow a player on the other team to get
open<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.629> creates<00:00:58.190> mismatches<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
open but it creates mismatches that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
open but it creates mismatches that
shouldn't<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.149> happening

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
shouldn't be happening

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.189 
shouldn't be happening
this<00:01:01.170> isn't<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.160> fast<00:01:02.460> break<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.049> only

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this isn't even a fast break so not only

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
this isn't even a fast break so not only
should<00:01:04.379> every<00:01:04.949> player<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.519> covered<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.630> my

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
should every player be covered but my

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
should every player be covered but my
team<00:01:07.530> should<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:07.950> making<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.520> attempt<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
team should be making an attempt to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050

guard the man that I want them to be
guarding<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.930> shouldn't<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.890> worry<00:01:14.159> about

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
guarding I shouldn't have to worry about

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429

you've<00:02:18.590> been<00:02:18.860> watching<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.610> similar<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you've been watching is similar to the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.680 
you've been watching is similar to the
broadcast<00:02:21.020> camera<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.980> basically<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.360> can't

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
broadcast camera and basically I can't

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.480 
broadcast camera and basically I can't
see<00:02:23.959> what's<00:02:24.200> happening<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> other<00:02:25.160> side

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
see what's happening on the other side

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.060 
see what's happening on the other side
of<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> court<00:02:26.030> until<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.959> too<00:02:27.140> late<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
of the court until it's too late and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.490 
of the court until it's too late and
even<00:02:28.820> if<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.090> could<00:02:29.120> see<00:02:29.660> what's<00:02:29.900> happening

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
even if I could see what's happening

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.640 
even if I could see what's happening
this<00:02:31.160> mismatch<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.090> still<00:02:32.420> going<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.989> occur<00:02:33.350> so

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
this mismatch is still going to occur so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.110 
this mismatch is still going to occur so
let's<00:02:34.550> take<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.850> look<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.720> who<00:02:35.959> messed<00:02:36.320> up

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
let's take a look and see who messed up

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.470 
let's take a look and see who messed up
this<00:02:38.120> time<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.900> Ginobili<00:02:39.730> he's<00:02:40.730> standing<00:02:41.360> in

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
this time is Ginobili he's standing in

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.290 
this time is Ginobili he's standing in
the<00:02:41.660> paint<00:02:41.959> doing<00:02:42.410> nothing<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.310> now<00:02:43.790> mourning

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the paint doing nothing and now mourning

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.220 
the paint doing nothing and now mourning

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.370 
finally Ginobili says well okay I'll
play<00:02:51.140> defense<00:02:51.709> now<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:53.450> he<00:02:53.570> goes<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> guard

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380

ochre<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.670> I'm<00:02:55.910> faced<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.180> two

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
ochre and now I'm faced with two

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.110 
ochre and now I'm faced with two
mismatches<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.890> you<00:02:57.980> can<00:02:58.190> see<00:02:58.459> at<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.790> end<00:02:58.970> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
mismatches and you can see at the end of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.020 
mismatches and you can see at the end of
the<00:02:59.209> replay<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.320> AI<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:01.250> ready<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.820> take

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the replay the AI is ready to take

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.780 
the replay the AI is ready to take
advantage<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:04.070> here's<00:03:04.370> another

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
advantage of that so here's another

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.330 
advantage of that so here's another
example<00:03:05.180> showing<00:03:06.049> how<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.380> can't<00:03:06.890> even<00:03:06.980> begin

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
example showing how I can't even begin

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.180 
example showing how I can't even begin
to<00:03:07.610> play<00:03:08.030> defense<00:03:08.630> because<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.739> stupid

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
to play defense because of this stupid

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.850 
to play defense because of this stupid
mismatch<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.450> keeps<00:03:11.720> happening<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.709> no

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
mismatch that keeps happening for no

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.610 
mismatch that keeps happening for no
reason<00:03:13.430> my<00:03:14.060> teammates<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:14.900> not<00:03:15.080> even<00:03:15.380> trying

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
reason my teammates are not even trying

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.960 
reason my teammates are not even trying
to<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.220> back<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.730> defend<00:03:17.360> their<00:03:18.040> assignments

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.509 

so<00:03:22.970> here's<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.420> last<00:03:23.660> example<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:25.400> I'm

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
so here's the last example that I'm

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.680 
so here's the last example that I'm
gonna<00:03:25.640> show<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.820> replay<00:03:29.060> I'm<00:03:29.450> using

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
gonna show and in this replay I'm using

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.610 
gonna show and in this replay I'm using

green and I do reach because I thought

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.969 
green and I do reach because I thought
he<00:04:18.919> was<00:04:19.040> he<00:04:19.459> might<00:04:19.669> pass<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.299> way<00:04:20.799> but<00:04:21.799> he

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
he was he might pass it that way but he

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.650 
he was he might pass it that way but he
does<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.370> he<00:04:22.460> passes<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.090> way

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
does and he passes it this way

and<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:26.720> all<00:04:26.960> happened<00:04:27.639> why<00:04:28.639> why<00:04:29.510> did<00:04:29.780> this

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
and this all happened why why did this

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.000 
and this all happened why why did this
