 navigate in three and more seasons I 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.240
 that I see more of the channel of al capone are 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.590

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.770
 like this channel is that sometimes 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.180
 Populists they tend terror things 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.540
 in what I like about the capon channel 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.850
 but it is another worse one we are in the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.379
 creation of how to draw the capone in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.620
 this occasion this use a line 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.530
 horizontal 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 commented that first I started to draw what 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:57.149
 that was the eyebrows and then the eyes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.930
 I was already calculating where I was going to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.690
 put the nose and then hand me 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.570
 I do not know saying that capone angelina 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:19.030
 jolie but she put on the same pose but it's 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 other but pettitte operations the eye 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.090
 that it worked out that came out a little bit 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 very very good a little bit far away and you 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.579
 I'm going to correct it, I'm going to put more more 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.680
 close to the left left eye of 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.320
 our sight 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.870
 there is almost no paddling that much just use 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.830
 the four lists for older lines 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.510
 with a lot of nose I wanted to make a 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.330
 little like that the texture of the shadow 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.240
 and owns a for the background music the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.760
 pose because they have a kid 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.310
 studious good child good that to feel 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.490
 with fucking art and moms and in Chinese a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490
 zote 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.630
 the artist is mozart 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.100
 but it's not another but I'm going to put a veto on 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.440
 but that way I did not want to put more 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.810
 and we are drawing the head sets 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.730
 we remark what is the chick and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 wash it after hand sad hands 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.760
 Cotonete I preferred this first shadow and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.439
 then later this remarcarlo with pencil 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.860
 and well that's how it was the all 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.329
 palmer last and to erase it the right eye 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.519
 so do not include us and if not 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.560
 they start to draw because because the 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.819
 personal , I recommend following my lines 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.499
 effect the crazy right but of equal 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.980
 we are already knowing with the pencil 6b 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:58.489
 materials is the 2h pencil and 6 sees 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.489
 nothing else 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:12.540
 this video was sued some strong 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.590
 psychological hugs written scene and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.250
 as this is already beginning 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.819
 behind the right eye will bring a 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.819
 a little more 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.610
 I love I love classical music 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.370
 is one of the favorites besides the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.519
 metal and dubstep of equal to equal 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.080
 it does not matter but in the same way 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.860
 Al Capone strong this already longer reaches the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.959
