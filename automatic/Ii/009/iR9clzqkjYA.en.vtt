mackay<00:00:28.480> isn't<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.779> company<00:00:29.110> that<00:00:29.230> you'd

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
mackay isn't a company that you'd

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.690 
mackay isn't a company that you'd
normally<00:00:29.529> associate<00:00:30.189> with<00:00:30.220> guitar

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
normally associate with guitar

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700 
normally associate with guitar
amplifiers<00:00:31.240> but<00:00:31.720> if<00:00:31.869> surprised<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.410> all<00:00:32.529> at

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
amplifiers but if surprised is all at

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.870 
amplifiers but if surprised is all at
the<00:00:32.770> messe<00:00:32.950> here<00:00:33.190> by<00:00:33.340> turning<00:00:33.579> up<00:00:33.760> with

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
the messe here by turning up with

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.700 
the messe here by turning up with
something<00:00:34.210> called<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.510> hot<00:00:34.630> wire<00:00:34.840> Martel<00:00:35.680> is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
something called the hot wire Martel is

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.229 
something called the hot wire Martel is
going<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.100> tell<00:00:36.250> us<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.400> concept<00:00:36.910> behind<00:00:36.940> this

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
going to tell us the concept behind this

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.060 
going to tell us the concept behind this
thing<00:00:37.510> which<00:00:37.989> looks<00:00:38.260> rather<00:00:38.470> different<00:00:38.980> to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
thing which looks rather different to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.280 
thing which looks rather different to
your<00:00:39.190> traditional<00:00:39.550> amplifier<00:00:39.940> yeah<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.140> we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
your traditional amplifier yeah so we

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.080 
your traditional amplifier yeah so we
have<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.620> hot<00:00:41.800> wire<00:00:41.950> here<00:00:42.310> which<00:00:42.940> is

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
have the hot wire here which is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.319 
have the hot wire here which is
basically<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.690> combination<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:44.730> tube<00:00:45.730> driven

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
basically a combination of tube driven

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.349 
basically a combination of tube driven
input<00:00:47.050> section<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.980> MOSFET<00:00:48.519> output

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
input section and a MOSFET output

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.110 
input section and a MOSFET output
section<00:00:49.539> together<00:00:50.289> with<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.680> digital<00:00:51.120> effects

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
section together with a digital effects

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.419 
section together with a digital effects
section<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.469> good<00:00:53.620> thing<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.129> main

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
section and the good thing and the main

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.400 
section and the good thing and the main
thing<00:00:54.489> about<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.750> tubes<00:00:56.079> are

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
thing about that is the tubes are

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.849 
thing about that is the tubes are
switched<00:00:56.949> in<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.309> live<00:00:57.489> hardwired<00:00:57.910> hard<00:00:58.719> mode

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.009 

bye-bye<00:01:02.859> relays<00:01:03.339> so<00:01:03.789> it's<00:01:04.000> completely<00:01:04.180> analog

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
bye-bye relays so it's completely analog

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.090 
bye-bye relays so it's completely analog
but<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.130> effects<00:01:06.520> are<00:01:06.610> digital<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.440> this

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
but the effects are digital so and this

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.090 
but the effects are digital so and this
thing<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.450> unbelievably<00:01:10.450> will<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.900> like<00:01:11.110> as

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
thing is unbelievably will be like as

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.460 
thing is unbelievably will be like as
you<00:01:12.310> can<00:01:12.460> see<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:12.850> was<00:01:13.390> achieved<00:01:13.900> with<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.170> tube

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
you can see I was achieved with the tube

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.140 
you can see I was achieved with the tube
amplifier<00:01:14.920> because<00:01:15.100> traditionally<00:01:16.030> you've

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
amplifier because traditionally you've

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.120 
amplifier because traditionally you've
got<00:01:16.300> big<00:01:16.450> heavy<00:01:16.659> transformers<00:01:17.260> in<00:01:17.380> there<00:01:17.560> okay

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
got big heavy transformers in there okay

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.050 
got big heavy transformers in there okay
so<00:01:18.190> I'm<00:01:18.340> going<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.550> switch<00:01:18.820> mode<00:01:19.030> power

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
so I'm going to switch mode power

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.990 
so I'm going to switch mode power
supplies<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.410> big<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.160> also<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.760> have

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
supplies and and big and also you have

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.050 
supplies and and big and also you have
speakers<00:01:22.750> who<00:01:23.200> are<00:01:23.440> really<00:01:24.070> heavy<00:01:24.250> weight<00:01:24.550> so

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
speakers who are really heavy weight so

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.970 
speakers who are really heavy weight so
to<00:01:25.120> achieve<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.690> no<00:01:25.930> mekhi<00:01:26.830> people<00:01:27.280> have<00:01:28.980> you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
to achieve that no mekhi people have you

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.560 
to achieve that no mekhi people have you
know<00:01:30.010> they<00:01:30.340> have<00:01:30.580> built<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:31.000> really<00:01:31.240> light

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
know they have built a really light

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.260 
know they have built a really light
thing<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:33.370> tube<00:01:33.580> sections<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.060> don't

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
thing and the tube sections you don't

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.090 
thing and the tube sections you don't
need<00:01:34.390> any<00:01:34.570> output<00:01:35.020> transformer<00:01:35.740> since<00:01:35.950> this

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
need any output transformer since this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.640 
need any output transformer since this
is<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:37.030> MOSFET<00:01:37.900> output<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.980> is<00:01:39.130> very<00:01:39.220> light

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
is a MOSFET output and it is very light

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.500 
is a MOSFET output and it is very light
so<00:01:42.650> what<00:01:42.920> kind<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.280> programmability<00:01:43.880> and

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
so what kind of programmability and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.390 
so what kind of programmability and
defects<00:01:45.110> can<00:01:45.380> we<00:01:45.470> expect<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.890> have<00:01:46.100> from<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
defects can we expect to have from the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.270 
defects can we expect to have from the
Interpol<00:01:46.730> well<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.720> can<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.350> can<00:01:48.560> store<00:01:48.920> just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
Interpol well you can you can store just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.330 
Interpol well you can you can store just
everything<00:01:50.210> except<00:01:50.960> except<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.010> master

you<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.120> record<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.900> can<00:02:20.990> overdub<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
you can record it you can overdub and it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.650 
you can record it you can overdub and it
can<00:02:21.950> start<00:02:22.190> stop<00:02:22.550> right<00:02:22.970> from<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.180> board<00:02:23.480> I

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
can start stop right from the board I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.840 
can start stop right from the board I
believe<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.680> Greg<00:02:25.010> Mack<00:02:25.190> he<00:02:25.340> himself<00:02:25.670> was

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
believe that Greg Mack he himself was

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.250 
believe that Greg Mack he himself was
behind<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.660> he's<00:02:26.750> putting<00:02:26.959> some

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
behind this and he's putting some

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.530 
behind this and he's putting some
features<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> wouldn't<00:02:27.950> expect<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:29.030> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
features you wouldn't expect that like I
