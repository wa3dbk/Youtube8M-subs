steady<00:03:07.800> stream<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.250> order<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.239> maybe<00:03:10.170> 2-3

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
steady stream of order to maybe 2-3

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.979 
steady stream of order to maybe 2-3
drops<00:03:10.920> per<00:03:11.250> second<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:11.910> even<00:03:11.970> slower<00:03:12.600> if<00:03:12.810> it's

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
drops per second or even slower if it's

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.449
