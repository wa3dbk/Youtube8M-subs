so<00:03:26.959> obviously<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.220> very<00:03:29.860> different

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
so obviously this is a very different

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.699 
so obviously this is a very different
way<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.030> these<00:03:32.510> cards<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.200> would

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
way so you have these cards that would

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.569 
way so you have these cards that would
be<00:03:33.829> facedown<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:36.040> then<00:03:37.040> you've<00:03:37.190> got<00:03:37.370> your

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
be facedown and then you've got your

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.060 
be facedown and then you've got your
plains<00:03:38.299> chaser<00:03:38.810> plane<00:03:39.769> chase<00:03:40.130> deck<00:03:42.070> very

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
plains chaser plane chase deck very

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.270 
plains chaser plane chase deck very
similar<00:03:43.519> packaged<00:03:43.910> into<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> intro<00:03:44.900> deck

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
similar packaged into like a intro deck

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.530 
similar packaged into like a intro deck
obviously<00:03:46.280> very<00:03:46.519> important<00:03:47.060> here<00:03:47.209> you've<00:03:47.360> got

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
obviously very important here you've got

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.620 
obviously very important here you've got
your<00:03:47.570> instruction<00:03:48.140> manual<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:50.150> actually<00:03:50.600> I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
your instruction manual and actually I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.330 
your instruction manual and actually I
think<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.110> your<00:03:51.260> general<00:03:51.590> how<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.040> play

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
think you have your general how to play

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.800 
think you have your general how to play
and<00:03:52.700> then<00:03:52.790> probably<00:03:53.030> how<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> play<00:03:53.600> this

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
and then probably how to play this

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.229 
and then probably how to play this
variation<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.060> have<00:03:57.730> yeah<00:03:58.730> your<00:03:58.910> Magic

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
variation so you have yeah your Magic

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.789 
variation so you have yeah your Magic
the<00:03:59.329> Gathering<00:03:59.360> book<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.380> then<00:04:00.470> you've<00:04:00.590> got

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the Gathering book and then you've got

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:09.210 
the Gathering book and then you've got
how<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.519> play<00:04:04.030> let's<00:04:05.030> see<00:04:05.209> what's<00:04:05.390> in<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.600> deck

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.580 

now<00:04:10.220> I'm<00:04:10.400> not<00:04:10.520> sure<00:04:10.580> if<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.660> would<00:04:12.170> assume<00:04:12.530> that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
now I'm not sure if I would assume that

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.780 
now I'm not sure if I would assume that
these<00:04:13.010> decks<00:04:13.550> are<00:04:14.200> kind<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.320> their<00:04:16.070> own<00:04:16.220> cards

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
these decks are kind of their own cards

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.160 
these decks are kind of their own cards
because<00:04:17.030> I'm<00:04:17.120> seeing<00:04:17.330> a<00:04:17.420> symbol<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:17.989> not

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
because I'm seeing a symbol that I'm not

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.590 
because I'm seeing a symbol that I'm not
super<00:04:18.560> familiar<00:04:18.590> with<00:04:19.100> but<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:20.300> could<00:04:20.480> be

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
super familiar with but it could be

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.940 
super familiar with but it could be
wrong<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> you've<00:04:22.670> got<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.710> lot<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.740> different

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
wrong so you've got a lot of different

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.090 
wrong so you've got a lot of different
creatures<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.850> here<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:27.080> don't<00:04:27.710> know<00:04:27.770> if<00:04:27.860> any<00:04:28.010> of

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.290 
creatures in here I don't know if any of
these<00:04:28.220> are<00:04:28.280> kind<00:04:28.700> of<00:04:28.760> you've<00:04:28.880> got<00:04:28.910> green

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
these are kind of you've got green

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.550 
these are kind of you've got green
you've<00:04:29.660> got<00:04:29.900> red

again<00:05:50.540> this<00:05:50.900> is<00:05:51.050> brand<00:05:51.350> new<00:05:51.470> to<00:05:51.680> me<00:05:51.800> so<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.100> may

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
again this is brand new to me so you may

this<00:05:54.830> is<00:05:54.890> a<00:05:55.100> six<00:05:55.520> drop<00:05:55.940> five<00:05:56.270> six<00:05:56.600> with<00:05:56.810> reach

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
this is a six drop five six with reach

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.330 
this is a six drop five six with reach
so<00:05:57.380> that<00:05:57.530> means<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.800> can<00:05:57.919> block<00:05:58.070> flying

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
so that means it can block flying

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.490 
so that means it can block flying
creatures<00:05:58.730> and<00:05:59.030> whenever<00:05:59.660> an<00:05:59.870> opponent<00:06:00.260> casts

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500

a spell put a 1-1 Green insect creature
token<00:06:03.470> out<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.919> battlefield<00:06:04.220> so<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:05.210> it

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
token out of the battlefield so the it

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.270 
token out of the battlefield so the it
seems<00:06:05.990> like<00:06:06.140> this<00:06:06.350> deck<00:06:06.560> creates<00:06:07.010> a<00:06:07.100> lot<00:06:07.250> of

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
seems like this deck creates a lot of

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.510 
seems like this deck creates a lot of
tokens<00:06:07.760> thus<00:06:08.440> those<00:06:09.440> tokens<00:06:09.710> are<00:06:10.010> able<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.340> be

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
tokens thus those tokens are able to be

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.540 
tokens thus those tokens are able to be
devoured<00:06:11.000> in<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:12.710> used<00:06:13.250> in<00:06:13.400> different

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
devoured in and and used in different

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.719 
devoured in and and used in different
ways<00:06:13.730> so<00:06:14.000> you've<00:06:14.120> got<00:06:14.300> dual<00:06:14.540> lands<00:06:15.729> two

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
ways so you've got dual lands two

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.330 
ways so you've got dual lands two
different<00:06:17.090> dual<00:06:17.450> lands<00:06:18.010> then<00:06:19.010> you've<00:06:19.130> got<00:06:19.310> a

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
different dual lands then you've got a

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.970 
different dual lands then you've got a
regular<00:06:19.940> land<00:06:20.210> you've<00:06:20.570> got<00:06:20.720> some<00:06:20.990> artifacts

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
regular land you've got some artifacts

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.120 
regular land you've got some artifacts
