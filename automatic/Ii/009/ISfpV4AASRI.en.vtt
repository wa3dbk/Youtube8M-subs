not<00:03:37.280> very<00:03:37.519> good<00:03:37.579> I<00:03:37.880> think<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.750> maybe<00:03:39.560> you

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
not very good I think and maybe you

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.250 
not very good I think and maybe you
should<00:03:39.739> get<00:03:40.150> other<00:03:41.150> batteries<00:03:41.569> which<00:03:41.959> lasts

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
should get other batteries which lasts

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.949 
should get other batteries which lasts
longer

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959
