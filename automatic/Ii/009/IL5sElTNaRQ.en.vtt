00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
to leave enough opening for this boat

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.850 
to leave enough opening for this boat
and<00:01:58.550> that<00:01:59.360> will<00:01:59.569> be<00:01:59.720> an<00:01:59.810> opening<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.289> boat<00:02:00.470> like

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
and that will be an opening a boat like

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.180 
and that will be an opening a boat like
this

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
this

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.369 
this
so<00:02:01.610> rather<00:02:01.789> than<00:02:01.940> fastening<00:02:02.780> off<00:02:02.929> I'm<00:02:03.170> just
