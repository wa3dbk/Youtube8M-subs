 Hi, I'm Eliane. 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.640
 a pancake that many people call 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.789
 crepe because it made with the range of 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.739
 tapioca mixed with an egg but I go 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.029
 make this recipe also with flours 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.029
 rich in fiber 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.050
 this recipe takes two eggs 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.390
 the tapioca gum use two spoons 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.769
 and one spoon of each flour I use one 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.610
 spoon of coconut flour plus one 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:53.930
 tablespoon of oat bran one 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.899
 coconut oil dessert spoon 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.320
 if you prefer you can use another oil 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:06.020
 one tablespoon of the flour 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:12.140
 whole wheat and 4 tablespoons of water use 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.050
 a little salt hit with a was 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 interesting to discuss well to get the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.970
 I like egg, right? 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.710
 uses enough force there goes well this 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.140
 brand you can make the double and 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.030
 already stopped leaving the pancakes in 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.789
 refrigerator and you are using it day in and day out 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.890
 during the week until freezing 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.580
 now we're going to take to the fire in a 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.580
 very hot frying pan 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.260
 the salty filling 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.490
 We are going to cheese cherry tomatoes and 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.560
 some interim 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.990
 but you can use whatever you have 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.080
 I wish you have at home and a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.080
 interesting that is a hip an influenza 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 Why can not you eat breakfast? 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.930
 which is a source of good fat protein and a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.420
 slow carbohydrate is an option 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.390
 interesting pre-workout or 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.590
 Ensure hunger until lunchtime 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.320
 Oregano oregano is good because it is a 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.880
 seasoning that has anti inflammatory action 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.209
 of the organism 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.400
 it only doubles in the crepe format and is 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.250
 an option that you can consume in your 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.380
 morning or light dinner is only 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.880
 add a salad of leaves that 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.190
 that's what you have for a meal 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.860
 complete you can also consume it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 cold or warm back to the skillet 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.830
 to warm up a bit and melt a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.690
 little cheese 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.340
 Here's your pancake ready or if you 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.340
