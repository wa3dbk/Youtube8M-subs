00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
sofas out of the way and then you will

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.310 
sofas out of the way and then you will
have<00:01:21.350> dining<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.890> 12<00:01:24.080> 15<00:01:25.250> 20<00:01:26.250> even<00:01:27.320> perhaps

have dining for 12 15 20 even perhaps

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
have dining for 12 15 20 even perhaps
more<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.450> maximum

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
more than that because then the maximum

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
more than that because then the maximum
length<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> table<00:01:31.800> is<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.270> farthest

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
length of the table is the farthest

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
length of the table is the farthest
