believe the Green Bay Packers won this

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.480 
believe the Green Bay Packers won this
one<00:00:09.480> they<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> b-plus<00:00:10.830> from<00:00:11.040> me<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> thought

one they get a b-plus from me I thought

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180 
one they get a b-plus from me I thought
the<00:00:11.700> haha<00:00:12.330> clinton-dix<00:00:12.809> election<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.530> 21<00:00:13.980> was

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the haha clinton-dix election to 21 was

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.340 
the haha clinton-dix election to 21 was
very<00:00:14.549> very<00:00:14.880> solid<00:00:15.450> they<00:00:15.570> needed<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.900> fill<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
very very solid they needed to fill that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.450 
very very solid they needed to fill that
need<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.619> think<00:00:16.980> he<00:00:17.100> could<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.340> potentially

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
need I think he could have potentially

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880 
need I think he could have potentially
also<00:00:17.910> been<00:00:18.150> their<00:00:18.660> best<00:00:18.960> player<00:00:19.289> available<00:00:19.320> on

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
also been their best player available on

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.290 
also been their best player available on
their<00:00:20.010> board<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> time<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> thought

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
their board at the time so I thought

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.390 
their board at the time so I thought
that<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> great<00:00:21.930> pick<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.260> them<00:00:22.590> Davante

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that was a great pick for them Davante

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.179 
that was a great pick for them Davante
Adams<00:00:23.510> Jared<00:00:24.510> Abbrederis<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.260> Jeff<00:00:25.740> Janice

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
Adams Jared Abbrederis and Jeff Janice

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
Adams Jared Abbrederis and Jeff Janice
all<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> wide<00:00:27.180> receiver<00:00:27.570> position<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
all at the wide receiver position are

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.960 
all at the wide receiver position are
going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> help<00:00:28.650> replenish<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.220> position

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
going to help replenish that position

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
going to help replenish that position
for<00:00:30.150> Aaron<00:00:30.750> Rodgers<00:00:31.170> he<00:00:31.349> needs<00:00:31.560> more<00:00:31.769> weapons

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
for Aaron Rodgers he needs more weapons

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920 
for Aaron Rodgers he needs more weapons
so<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> thought<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.450> did<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> great<00:00:33.840> job

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so I thought they did a great job

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
so I thought they did a great job
filling<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.610> couple<00:00:35.820> other

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
filling that as well and a couple other

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
filling that as well and a couple other
players<00:00:36.390> who<00:00:36.930> fill<00:00:37.200> needs<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
players who fill needs I think the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
players who fill needs I think the
Chicago<00:00:38.219> Bears<00:00:38.730> were<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> loser<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
Chicago Bears were the loser in the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.010 
Chicago Bears were the loser in the
division<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> b-minus<00:00:41.809> headed<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
division with a b-minus headed to the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
division with a b-minus headed to the
NFC<00:00:43.350> East<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> Philadelphia<00:00:44.280> Eagles<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
NFC East the Philadelphia Eagles I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
NFC East the Philadelphia Eagles I
thought<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> NFC<00:00:45.239> East<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.570> one<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> those

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
thought the NFC East was one of those

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
thought the NFC East was one of those
divisions<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.500> didn't<00:00:46.890> draft<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.370> well

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
divisions that didn't draft very well

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
divisions that didn't draft very well
but<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> Eagles<00:00:48.539> after<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> Marcus<00:00:49.680> Smith

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
but the Eagles after the Marcus Smith

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
but the Eagles after the Marcus Smith
pic<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.309> thought<00:00:50.550> did<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.390> job

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
pic I thought did a very good job

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
pic I thought did a very good job
filling<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.739> players<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.670> need<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.629> players

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
filling in players of need with players

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
filling in players of need with players
of<00:00:55.379> value<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:55.949> well<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> Jordan

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
of value as well I like the Jordan

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450 
of value as well I like the Jordan
Matthews<00:00:57.719> pick<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.949> i<00:00:59.250> thought

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
Matthews pick there as well so i thought

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
Matthews pick there as well so i thought
the<00:00:59.609> eagles<00:01:00.000> did<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> solid<00:01:00.480> job<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the eagles did a solid job they get a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
the eagles did a solid job they get a
b-minus<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.280> me<00:01:02.430> i<00:01:02.640> believe<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> redskins

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
b-minus for me i believe the redskins

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
b-minus for me i believe the redskins
get<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> C<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> lowest<00:01:05.580> rated<00:01:06.180> team

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
get a C which was the lowest rated team

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
get a C which was the lowest rated team
there<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> NFC<00:01:07.320> South<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.950> Tampa<00:01:08.280> Bay

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
there in the NFC South the Tampa Bay

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
there in the NFC South the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers<00:01:08.640> were<00:01:09.420> tied<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> saints<00:01:10.530> at

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
Buccaneers were tied with the saints at

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
Buccaneers were tied with the saints at
with<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:12.000> gonna<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.330> gonna<00:01:12.420> edge

out the the Buccaneers just because I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609

thought<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.420> offense<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
thought I know they went all offense but

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
thought I know they went all offense but
they<00:01:16.799> needed<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.520> often<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.060> needed

they needed to go all often they needed

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320 
they needed to go all often they needed
to<00:01:18.509> find<00:01:19.110> more<00:01:19.350> weapons<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:20.700> got<00:01:20.909> big<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to find more weapons they got big at the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.640 
to find more weapons they got big at the
wide<00:01:21.540> receiver<00:01:21.869> position<00:01:21.990> even<00:01:22.439> though<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
wide receiver position even though I

position<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.920> still<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> these

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the offensive line position so they get
