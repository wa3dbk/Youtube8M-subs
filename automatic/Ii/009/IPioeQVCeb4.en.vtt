00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.570 
everyone and welcome to another episode
of<00:00:02.850> minecraft<00:00:03.570> how<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.130> today<00:00:05.130> I'm<00:00:05.370> going<00:00:05.520> to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
of minecraft how to today I'm going to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.350 
of minecraft how to today I'm going to
show<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.270> mine<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.839> diamonds<00:00:07.760> so<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
show you how to mine for diamonds so the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.629 
show you how to mine for diamonds so the
first<00:00:09.480> thing<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.870> need<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> do<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.519> you<00:00:11.519> need

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
first thing you need to do is you need

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.919 
first thing you need to do is you need
to<00:00:12.019> dig<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> way<00:00:13.380> down<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.630> below<00:00:15.630> level

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
to dig all the way down to below level

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
to dig all the way down to below level
15<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.710> that's<00:00:16.890> where<00:00:17.039> diamond<00:00:17.369> door

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
15 because that's where diamond door

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640 
15 because that's where diamond door
spawns<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.150> level<00:00:18.449> 15<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:19.020> below<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
spawns so level 15 or below so if you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.670 
spawns so level 15 or below so if you
check<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.640> 7.6<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.810> diamonds<00:00:22.439> will<00:00:22.560> be

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
check here so 7.6 so diamonds will be

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.089 
check here so 7.6 so diamonds will be
spawning<00:00:22.949> at<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.250> level<00:00:24.470> then<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.890> need<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
spawning at this level then we need to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.679 
spawning at this level then we need to
do<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.279> need<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> build<00:00:26.670> these<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.630> are

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
do we need to build these these are

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
do we need to build these these are
known<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.289> strip<00:00:28.859> mines<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> all<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
known as strip mines and all it is is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
known as strip mines and all it is is
just<00:00:30.660> taking<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.170> 2<00:00:31.199> by<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.650> hole<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.160> forward

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
just taking a 2 by one hole just forward

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.639 
just taking a 2 by one hole just forward
forward<00:00:32.730> forward<00:00:33.000> until<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:34.110> find<00:00:34.380> diamond

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
forward forward until you find diamond

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
forward forward until you find diamond
so<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> found<00:00:34.950> diamonds<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> found<00:00:35.700> five<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so I found diamonds here I found five it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
so I found diamonds here I found five it
was<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> yeah<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:38.940> why<00:00:39.120> it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
was pretty good so yeah that's why it's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.959 
was pretty good so yeah that's why it's
been<00:00:39.239> hollowed<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
been hollowed out and then you want to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.340 
been hollowed out and then you want to
space<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.840> built<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.110> room

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
space these out so you built this room

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
space these out so you built this room
here<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> sort<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> main<00:00:44.520> hub<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.090> your

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
here it is sort of the main hub for your

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
here it is sort of the main hub for your
minds<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.350> spread<00:00:46.559> them<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.800> three

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
minds and then you spread them out three

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.290 
minds and then you spread them out three
blocks<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> between<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> finds<00:00:48.420> best<00:00:48.800> because

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
blocks in between I finds best because

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
blocks in between I finds best because
they<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.449> possible<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> diamond<00:00:52.949> door

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
they it is possible that a diamond door

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
they it is possible that a diamond door
could<00:00:53.670> stretch<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.230> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
could stretch over to not just here but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.709 
could stretch over to not just here but
over<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.160> well<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.760> which<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
over to here as well and which see and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
over to here as well and which see and
you<00:00:57.809> want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> avoid<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.379> much<00:00:58.500> over<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.039> as

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you want to avoid as much over as as

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
you want to avoid as much over as as
much<00:00:59.730> overlap<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.239> possible<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.350> can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
much overlap as possible so that you can

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
much overlap as possible so that you can
maximize<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.280> amount<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.609> diamond<00:01:03.329> daughter

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
maximize the amount of diamond daughter

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
maximize the amount of diamond daughter
you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.049> each<00:01:04.170> straight<00:01:04.500> line<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you can get from each straight line so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.280 
you can get from each straight line so
it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> possible<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.210> might<00:01:06.360> miss<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it is possible that you might miss or in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
it is possible that you might miss or in
this<00:01:07.470> blog<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this blog here if you if you do it here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
this blog here if you if you do it here
instead<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> doesn't<00:01:11.070> really

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
instead of here but it doesn't really

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
instead of here but it doesn't really
matter<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.570> quickest<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
matter because it's the quickest way to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620 
matter because it's the quickest way to
find<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.710> most<00:01:13.860> amount<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> diamond<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.450> then

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
find the most amount of diamond so then

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.350 
find the most amount of diamond so then
I'm<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.200> off<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> new<00:01:16.380> strip<00:01:16.860> mine

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
I'm going to start off a new strip mine

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.140 
I'm going to start off a new strip mine
here<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:20.189> goes<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
here and then it just goes like so so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.440 
here and then it just goes like so so
just<00:01:22.020> dig<00:01:22.820> see<00:01:23.820> how<00:01:23.880> hopefully<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.299> find

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
just dig see how hopefully I can find

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
just dig see how hopefully I can find
some<00:01:24.689> diamond<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.340> might<00:01:26.340> keep<00:01:26.549> mining<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.000> too

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
some diamond I might keep mining in too

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.719 
some diamond I might keep mining in too
fast<00:01:27.180> food<00:01:27.420> we'll<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.310> while<00:01:29.490> mining

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
fast food we'll see so he while mining

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
fast food we'll see so he while mining
throw<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> torch<00:01:33.860> yep<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.509> dymond<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> see

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
throw down a torch yep so dymond so see

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.890 
throw down a torch yep so dymond so see
look<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.270> point<00:01:39.390> exactly<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
look you see that's my point exactly it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.270 
look you see that's my point exactly it
stretches<00:01:40.350> across<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> middle<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:43.280> there

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
stretches across to the middle and there

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
stretches across to the middle and there
you<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.030> some<00:01:45.210> diamond<00:01:45.509> second

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you have it there's some diamond second

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
you have it there's some diamond second
wait<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.740> should<00:01:46.890> carry<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.610> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
wait then we do should carry on going I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
was just starting a new mine just to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
was just starting a new mine just to
show<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> tutorial<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.479> carry

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
on going we're going and then sort of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.649 
on going we're going and then sort of
you<00:01:53.610> start<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> new<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.090> because<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
you start a new one because you want to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.969 
you start a new one because you want to
be<00:01:54.750> running<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.259> down<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:55.770> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
be running up and down all the time so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.139 
be running up and down all the time so
you<00:01:56.040> start<00:01:56.280> new<00:01:56.430> ones<00:01:56.460> every<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.030> then

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you start new ones every now and then

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.510 
you start new ones every now and then
just<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:58.020> quick<00:01:58.290> sit<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.009> speeds<00:01:59.280> sake

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
just for quick sit just for speeds sake

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.459 
just for quick sit just for speeds sake
