00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:54.779 
the end of the chapter obviously he's

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.469 
the end of the chapter obviously he's
heading<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.319> punk<00:04:55.830> hazard<00:04:56.039> and<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:57.150> me<00:04:57.270> it

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.899 
seems as if he's heading to punk hazard
because<00:04:59.969> of<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:01.409> no<00:05:01.650> response<00:05:01.860> from<00:05:02.550> monae

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909
