switch you got to find what I did is I
went<00:00:54.000> straight<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.600> fuse<00:00:54.960> box<00:00:55.379> where<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
went straight to my fuse box where it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.020 
went straight to my fuse box where it
says<00:00:56.100> radio<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> turn<00:00:59.100> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
says radio and that way when you turn it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
says radio and that way when you turn it
on<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.390> knows<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.750> turn<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:06.720> wire<00:01:07.200> right

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
on it knows to turn on this wire right

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.750 
on it knows to turn on this wire right
here<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:09.260> my<00:01:10.260> red<00:01:11.130> wire<00:01:11.689> my<00:01:12.689> switch<00:01:13.049> wire<00:01:13.320> and

here is my red wire my switch wire and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.960 
here is my red wire my switch wire and
then<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.689> room<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.970> power

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
then you can see these two room I power

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
then you can see these two room I power
my<00:01:18.299> ground<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> into<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.670> engine

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

compartment three basic wires just run
them<00:01:28.280> it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.549> simpler

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.380 

like<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.770> said<00:01:34.009> nobody<00:01:34.189> else<00:01:34.579> showed<00:01:35.119> me<00:01:35.270> how<00:01:35.360> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
like I said nobody else showed me how to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.630

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that was for until I hope mine up and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.380 
that was for until I hope mine up and
realize<00:02:57.829> hey<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:58.220> probably<00:02:58.910> what<00:02:59.209> that's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
realize hey that's probably what that's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.660 
realize hey that's probably what that's
for

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.020 

this<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.799> 1779<00:03:03.799> Ford<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:07.010> put<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.459> in

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
this is 1779 Ford and I just put that in

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.309 
this is 1779 Ford and I just put that in
there<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.590> also<00:03:09.590> have<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:11.260> 88<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:13.510> had<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.720> wire

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
there I also have a 88 for had the wire

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.289 
there I also have a 88 for had the wire
harness<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.859> cut<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> wire<00:03:16.250> harness<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.910> to

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
harness I cut the wire harness out to

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.849 
harness I cut the wire harness out to
put<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.569> my<00:03:17.720> other<00:03:17.900> pick<00:03:18.079> up<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.440> then

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
put it my other pick up and then

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.990 
put it my other pick up and then
realized<00:03:19.310> hey<00:03:19.639> I<00:03:19.910> don't<00:03:20.720> need<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.819> with

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
realized hey I don't need it and so with

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.569 
realized hey I don't need it and so with
this<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:23.359> what<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.510> did<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.440> couldn't<00:03:24.739> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
this one what I did is I couldn't the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.190 
this one what I did is I couldn't the
firewalls<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.150> lot<00:03:26.299> more<00:03:26.600> hard<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.900> get<00:03:27.019> through

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
firewalls a lot more hard to get through

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.099 
firewalls a lot more hard to get through
with<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.500> one<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.950> what<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> did<00:03:28.459> was<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:29.120> went

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
with this one so what I did was I went

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.949 
with this one so what I did was I went
for<00:03:30.920> my<00:03:30.950> power<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.940> constant<00:03:32.389> 12-volt<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
for my power for the constant 12-volt I

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.849 
for my power for the constant 12-volt I
went<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:35.450> lighter<00:03:35.959> thing<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.560> what

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
went to this the lighter thing and what

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.990 
went to this the lighter thing and what
you<00:03:36.950> do<00:03:37.100> is<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.310> just<00:03:37.340> use<00:03:37.730> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you do is you just use a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.780 
you do is you just use a
testing<00:03:40.000> light<00:03:40.210> good<00:03:41.050> ground<00:03:41.350> finder<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.730> you

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
testing light good ground finder and you

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.940 
testing light good ground finder and you
just<00:03:42.940> find<00:03:43.180> make<00:03:43.900> sure<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.140> key<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.770> the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
just find make sure the key is on the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.630 
just find make sure the key is on the
off<00:03:45.100> position<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:48.960> find<00:03:49.960> one<00:03:50.410> that's<00:03:50.640> on

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
off position and you find one that's on

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.390 
off position and you find one that's on
and<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:53.230> your<00:03:53.410> constant<00:03:53.890> power<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.280> then

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
and that's your constant power and then

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.210 
and that's your constant power and then
if<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.610> turn<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.970> switch<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:56.220> excel

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
if you turn the switch on to the excel

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.810 
if you turn the switch on to the excel
or<00:03:57.430> whatever<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.680> can<00:03:59.860> find<00:04:00.160> which<00:04:00.640> one

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
or whatever it you can find which one

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.770 
or whatever it you can find which one
needs<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.090> be<00:04:01.240> your<00:04:01.510> switch<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.230> all<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:03.780> so

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
needs to be your switch and all that so

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.900 
needs to be your switch and all that so
I<00:04:05.080> can<00:04:05.620> say<00:04:05.770> I<00:04:05.800> hope<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.220> helps<00:04:06.460> you<00:04:06.520> guys<00:04:06.670> out
