00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.640
 hello to all those gomez del tra station 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 and welcome to the third tutorial on bild 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
 kraft mod 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.870
 then today he will teach me to use a 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.330
 object a new object or the pump 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.989
 what the pump is used to extract 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.850
 of liquids then it can be water like 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.220
 may be the lava as can be the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 oil but oil is a 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.480
 mod material that I will show you 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:00.730
 later then this is the pump here 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 seacraft a with a tank or 8 of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:09.940
 so more glass a mining and mining well 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.920
 seacraft to with 6 iron ingots one 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.770
 red stone a small years ferla and one 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 it was a gere that kraft has with ashton 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.990
 say more stone 4 the djerassi stone 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.630
 crasta with four of a stone 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.180
 wooden turns which one comes with 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 four sticks 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.490
 then then we sold dig a pit 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.659
 between 2 3 of water 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:46.299
 ok perfect after which we position at 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:48.869
 pump in a high place if so-so 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.710
 ok 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:58.060
 then we connect another engine 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.950
 not in directing but the steam engine in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.539
 this way 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.840
 right-clicking on it 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:09.130
 a similar screen will appear 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.570
 let's say to an internal furnace 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.730
 we will not have to put fuel on them 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.990
 that coal can be charcoal 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.880
 in wood or lava in this case us 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.140
 we put the coal 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.980
 then we connect it through now 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 has an ok leverage then 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.799
 to be able to export water let's say 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.970
 the water is inspired by the pump but 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.680
 must be transported by something 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.030
 must be transported via the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.340
 pipe but not pipes those transports 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.799
 what we have seen the other times 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:56.780
 but the waterproof pipes have the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:59.090
 same identical function more or less though 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.819
 the only thing that works with them instead 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.329
 objects work with liquids 15 will 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.730
 lowden waterproof pipe used to make 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:13.930
 get the water out of the liquid from the pump 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.970
 but cobol on the water proof to move it 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.099
 the golden waterproof five you need for 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.900
 speed up liquids so let's take 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.790
 still I turned between red and just yes 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.780
 I would say that these parts are enough here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.200
 then as the first pipe we should 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.739
 connect the waterproof lowden to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.780
 wood we will connect it everywhere 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.750
 then we think up here and unlike 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:47.349
 of the wooden transport pipe not 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.169
 must be operated by any engine 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:55.299
 so we will save material 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:04:01.340
 then we connect it has a moment 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:03.560
 ok let's connect to a gold pipe and then 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.840
 to a co black stone in this liquid 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.120
 will come between the liquid in question in 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.459
 in this case the water will be passed 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 inside these tubes however it will have to 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.549
 to be brought into something will have to 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.660
 be brought into the tank what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.410
 we have seen excuse before 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.960
 ok what we saw before that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.490
 for kraft areas the pump if we go to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.940
 place it looks like gods 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.970
 Tank containers of tanks 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:40.520
 we say nothing is not yet another place 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.320
 so we connect them in this way 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.150
 way 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.430
 can be connected in any 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.430
 point you see ok 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:59.930
 and so in this way the machinery 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:01.790
 is complete let's see then if the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.030
 carbon has put we are going to activate 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.330
 the machinery lever starts the liquid 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:14.210
 you see it starts to be transported 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:18.890
 in the pulps you see little by little e 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:21.680
 will be brought inside see you do a 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.500
 3x3 cube that the best because the water 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.780
 continue to infinity see it comes 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:32.660
 let's say a cube is removed but returns e 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.270
 so infinite water let's see 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.140
 they will have inside this is useful 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.650
 because if we go with a bucket 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.570
 empty 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:49.150
 we take an empty bucket here if that 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:53.240
 we click so you see if it fills it 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.190
 obviously getting down to the level is however a 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.790
 useful method for not doing maybe ahead 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.590
 back if we are in the mountains 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.070
 in our world the distant sea this 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.470
 quite and very useful method for 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.900
 have water for us instead do forward e 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.900
 back from the sea to the mountain 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.610
 well then this tutorial ends here 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.040
 I recommend you make yourself like it 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.040
 put it in your favorites write a 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.730
 comment and above all subscribe to 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.200
 channel and see you at the next tutorial 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.040
 on the bild kraft mod 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040
