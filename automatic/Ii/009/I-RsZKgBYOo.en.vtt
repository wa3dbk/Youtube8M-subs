00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi guys I'm okay aline 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.600
 Mom and I came back to 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.300
 talk to you about a book that 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 I finished reading now, little does less than 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.620
 One day I'm very very anxious to 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.509
 to talk to you about what is the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.509
 elite that heats 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.930
 if you have not watched a video yet 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.850
 about the selection, I'll leave his link 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.740
 somewhere here because it's a 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.010
 It's a little tricky to talk about the second one. 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.080
 volume of the series is 100 from the spoiler they in 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.090
 suddenly tell some fact from the book 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.360
 for those who have not yet read 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 but anyway the selection but I know that many 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.260
 people Rated as destoop 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.140
 actually it can be classified as 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.040
 the stop but it was the book that more me 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.170
 surprised 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.239
 this year so far because when I 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.680
 I started reading I feel that his idea 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.560
 was a bit different from the others 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.410
 dystopias I have not even read many books 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.780
 gender because the very focus is on the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.270
 It is clear that over the course of the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.399
 girls are passing in the tall palace 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.280
 introduces some elements to 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.759
 justify because it is dystopia but the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.170
 focus is really the contest so do not think 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.330
 that with other books by sofia kim is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.210
 survival or it is the policy or 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.360
 are the critics have this also in the series 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.789
 but the focus is really the contest and everything 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 What happens inside the contest? 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.649
 so here it is in this second book already 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.069
 I think it's good to tell you right away. 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.780
 he is very dramatic 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.030
 usually I do not like books 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.490
 series of technology is usually the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.330
 second book that has this load 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.459
 I is not dramatic but very short 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.280
 elite was an exception because I succeeded 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:51.099
 to understand well the idea that here warms up 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.920
 I wanted to pass from her character to the 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.810
 reader and I got to understand America 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.619
 despite some moments when I 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.660
 I wanted to hit her head on the wall 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 after the end of the selection was 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.470
 evident that the theme of the elite would be 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.620
 doubt of america only what happens 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.599
 here she will introduce some more 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.760
 characters then actually the story 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.530
 It's not just a love triangle. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.180
 moment the story a square 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.980
 I do not know if this expression 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.349
 correct but you will understand what I 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.200
 I mean and a certain other 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.640
 book moment is already on the way 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.510
 this situation becomes a love story 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.960
 with at least five loving ends 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.940
 mode 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.670
 to say nothing of the development of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
 relationships between characters 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.240
 so the focus is not just what America 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.120
 Are you feeling what she's going through? 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 other characters begin to grow in the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.640
 history and have a different relevance 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.570
 from what we imagined reading the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.730
 I already want to let you know that some 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.950
 people just like I'm going to stay a little 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.080
 shocked by some of the discoveries that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.910
 You will have in relation to the max or that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.940
 book then I being timex 1 after 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.250
 the selection and after the story I've already started 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.110
 not know exactly if it is this 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 character that I want to cheer that does not 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.190
 not have done it and not for 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.660
 revelations 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.760
 so it is our ultra secret but at 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.670
 that what was leading 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 This character is the selection and in the story 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.590
 You and I at least begin. 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.540
 I did not wait for a reader. 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.800
 that she chose this character to whom 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 the elite 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.840
 one of the points I complained say 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.040
 so the selection was that she did not 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 explained well 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.380
 is the idea of ​​law how was the training until 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.320
 some people told me they existed 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.900
 sites and tatá was searching later but I 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.480
 I believe the following when the author creates 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.370
 a new universe in a new context for 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.110
 that what we already know he needs 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.940
 explain this prolator in a way that 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.280
 he understands and does not need in other 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.530
 sources then look for the best mine 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.480
 law, she explains in this 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.240
 because the stage in which the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.370
 participants in the competition 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.940
 introduce this kind of history of 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.100
 nation within the selection then here they 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.680
 need to deepen the 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.739
 contest goes a little about yourself just 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.170
 image just presentation as she gets 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.590
 port but does some tasks where 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.660
 they need is personally challenging 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.040
 then it introduces the history of there and 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.530
 how it all started 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.360
 and how the story of the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.980
 caste history 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.320
 within that context that I liked 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.480
 much for me was well in keeping with the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.950
 idea that she wanted to pass from that moment 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.260
 of the competition 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.370
 When I wrote there on the instant page . 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.740
 the child did 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.790
 the bucks on is beyond milk to 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.010
 elite 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.449
 many readers many friends who already 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.090
 read a book that wrote that 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.760
 they wanted to beat the average 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.820
 in America it's not like I already said that 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.650
 book his focus is her drama but 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.680
 different from what happened in other 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.389
 series I understood what America was 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.600
 feeling because she suddenly gives herself 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.970
 that she was very naive she 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.699
 he realized that only what 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.250
 really irritated her was the fact that 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.470
 that she had known since the previous book 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.199
 since the end of selection she 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.289
 needed to make a choice and that this 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.270
 choice could be positive or negative 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.940
 to either side of it 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.840
 Chose it, it takes too long to do 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.300
 this choice 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.850
 many things are happening that 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.880
 may involve her future within the 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.370
 contest or not and she's dramatizing 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.830
 She 's crying until she reflects, but she 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.020
 is not acting so that was the point 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.710
 What irritated me in America is she 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.479
 take too long to make that choice 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.570
 because her choice whatever it is 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.340
 that we will really know the end 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.380
 if in the next book you will have 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.349
 good and negative consequences for 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.490
 prass two then has no way to know 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.560
 Which one is the best? 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.330
 she has to ponder the moment and see the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.950
 that she wants more 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.289
 so that was the point that me all 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.539
 history not so much crying in america 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.699
 Because she cries a lot in this book is 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.580
 even a little shocking because in the book 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.139
 one is much stronger but here it is 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.150
 account of some things 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.789
 What I said about how she went 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.039
 innocent was not realizing everything 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:31.150
 happening around her then this 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:34.479
 my only good book complaint to 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.190
 elite also have more attacks on the palace 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.520
 This is very cool, it generates some scenes. 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.620
 very intense but she gave an end to 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.479
 this book was because of this end that 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.840
 not five stars because I do not 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:49.270
 I liked it, it's a decision that America 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.949
 take there in the end because I did not understand 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.530
 too much purpose 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:56.140
 Suddenly it's kind of against 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.840
 everything she's been doing up to here she 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.409
 to make that decision and decide on 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.389
 front 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.459
 so do not let five stars out of the book 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.669
 because I did not like the end of this 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:08.919
 final even though the final stretch but 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.379
 There is everything for the third book to have 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.330
 more action than these two because 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.819
 will probably have more attacks 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.739
 too and that's it, I do not want to talk too much 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.959
 not to spoil the surprise you that 

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:22.239
 leu does not fail to leave comments 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:24.699
 what did you think about elite what you 

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:26.769
 wait for the next book I did not stay 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.580
 so crazy about the sequel but I'm 

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:29.139
 curious 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.379
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.379
 liked
