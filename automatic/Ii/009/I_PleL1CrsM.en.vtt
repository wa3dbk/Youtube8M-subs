00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
listen to your string quartet for music
theory<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:37.079> oh<00:01:37.229> man<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.340> gonna

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
theory and think oh man that's gonna

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
theory and think oh man that's gonna
make<00:01:39.210> me<00:01:39.450> listen<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.020> classical<00:01:40.680> music

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
make me listen to classical music

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
make me listen to classical music
differently<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
differently that's probably not going to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
differently that's probably not going to
happen<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> that's<00:01:43.170> totally<00:01:43.710> cool<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
happen and that's totally cool the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
happen and that's totally cool the
reason<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.360> okay<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.960> because

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
reason I think it's okay is because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
reason I think it's okay is because
let's<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.700> example<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
let's take the good example of like you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
let's take the good example of like you
think<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> best<00:01:49.740> thing<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think this is the best thing like I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
think this is the best thing like I
played<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> piece<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> piano<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
played a piece on piano and I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
played a piece on piano and I
legitimately<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> you're<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.210> see

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
legitimately think that you're gonna see

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.100 
legitimately think that you're gonna see
God<00:01:54.899> now<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.979> I've<00:01:56.130> gifted<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.110> glorious

art anymore that's a lose situation the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
art anymore that's a lose situation the
other<00:02:10.680> end<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.150> it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
other end of it is that you think it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.780

the<00:02:12.600> worst<00:02:12.810> piece<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.770> ever<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
the worst piece of ever and that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.490 
the worst piece of ever and that
you<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.060> don't<00:02:15.240> want<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.720> show<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> anyone
