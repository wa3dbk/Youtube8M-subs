00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
murdered and of course the Hollywood

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
murdered and of course the Hollywood
film<00:01:02.760> brothers<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> mist<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.719> made<00:01:03.930> about

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
film brothers in the mist was made about

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
her work and about the book that she
wrote<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.479> she<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.780> started<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.680> first

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
wrote so she actually started the first

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
wrote so she actually started the first
anti-poaching<00:01:08.520> patrols<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
anti-poaching patrols so I think in the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
anti-poaching patrols so I think in the
modern<00:01:11.010> era<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
modern era that's that's the start of a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
modern era that's that's the start of a
protocol<00:01:13.290> station<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.670> asked<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
protocol station so we asked if one to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.859 
protocol station so we asked if one to
register<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> pay<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> set<00:01:17.490> fee<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
register and pay a set fee and then that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.790 
register and pay a set fee and then that
covers<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> costume<00:01:20.159> setting<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> run

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
covers the costume setting up the run

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.380 
covers the costume setting up the run
and<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.280> give<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.580> service<00:01:22.940> they<00:01:23.090> get<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and then give it a service they get to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330 
and then give it a service they get to
keep<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.110> then<00:01:24.350> they<00:01:24.470> use<00:01:24.770> their<00:01:25.100> other

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
keep so then they use their other

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.920 
keep so then they use their other
costumes<00:01:25.580> through<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.270> summative<00:01:26.690> phone

logging companies going for example they
build<00:02:51.020> roads<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.980> whereas<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.940> indigenous

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.270 
build roads so whereas the indigenous
people<00:02:53.720> perhaps<00:02:53.900> used<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> live<00:02:54.680> from<00:02:54.890> hunting

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
people perhaps used to live from hunting

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.430 
people perhaps used to live from hunting
and<00:02:55.430> fishing<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.910> was<00:02:56.060> sustainable<00:02:56.660> now

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
and fishing and it was sustainable now

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.860 
and fishing and it was sustainable now
it<00:02:57.590> becomes<00:02:57.860> unsustainable<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.880> then<00:02:59.600> once

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
it becomes unsustainable and then once

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.260 
it becomes unsustainable and then once
the<00:03:00.050> roads<00:03:00.290> go<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.520> resources<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
the roads go in the resources the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.270 
the roads go in the resources the
illegal<00:03:02.810> resources<00:03:03.320> start<00:03:03.620> coming<00:03:03.950> out<00:03:04.040> and

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
illegal resources start coming out and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.500 
illegal resources start coming out and
that's<00:03:04.400> where<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.060> bushmeat<00:03:05.450> trade

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
that's where you get the bushmeat trade

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.240 
that's where you get the bushmeat trade
so<00:03:06.020> our<00:03:06.230> challenges<00:03:06.830> are<00:03:07.010> new<00:03:07.220> challenges

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
so our challenges are new challenges

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.340 
so our challenges are new challenges
they're<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> old<00:03:08.330> challenges<00:03:08.930> but

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
they're not the old challenges but

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.570 
they're not the old challenges but
they're<00:03:09.830> there<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.160> they<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.459> be

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
they're there and they have to be

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.220 
they're there and they have to be
tackled

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230
