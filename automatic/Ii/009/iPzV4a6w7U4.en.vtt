00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
six millimeter gold-plated bead caps so

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.849 
six millimeter gold-plated bead caps so
all<00:01:00.949> we're<00:01:01.129> going<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.429> do<00:01:01.609> is<00:01:01.929> make<00:01:02.929> a<00:01:02.960> stick<00:01:03.530> on

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
all we're going to do is make a stick on

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.330 
all we're going to do is make a stick on
a<00:01:04.220> head<00:01:04.460> pin<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.380> create<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.620> wrapped<00:01:07.100> wire

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
a head pin and create a wrapped wire

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.260 
a head pin and create a wrapped wire
loop<00:01:07.960> you're<00:01:08.960> going<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.290> need<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:10.399> pair<00:01:11.240> of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
loop you're going to need a pair of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.030 
loop you're going to need a pair of
chain<00:01:11.570> nose<00:01:11.630> pliers<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:12.710> you're<00:01:12.890> either

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
chain nose pliers and then you're either

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.469 
chain nose pliers and then you're either
going<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.399> need<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.820> pair<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.210> round<00:01:14.360> nose

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
going to need a pair of round nose

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.210 
going to need a pair of round nose
pliers<00:01:14.899> or<00:01:15.340> some<00:01:16.340> wire<00:01:17.270> looping<00:01:17.780> pliers<00:01:18.220> and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
pliers or some wire looping pliers and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.859 
pliers or some wire looping pliers and
then<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.790> do<00:01:19.909> need<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> pair<00:01:20.329> of<00:01:20.360> flush<00:01:20.810> cutters

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
then you do need a pair of flush cutters

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.510 
then you do need a pair of flush cutters
also<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.700> take<00:01:23.090> one<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.360> your<00:01:23.479> head<00:01:23.630> pins<00:01:23.899> and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
also so take one of your head pins and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.690 
also so take one of your head pins and
place<00:01:25.520> your<00:01:25.850> cube<00:01:26.119> bead<00:01:26.360> onto<00:01:26.689> your<00:01:27.469> head<00:01:27.649> pin

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.020 

and<00:01:31.789> then<00:01:32.509> place<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.020> dome<00:01:33.259> bead<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.789> wide

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and then place the dome bead the wide

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.050 
and then place the dome bead the wide
side<00:01:35.479> down<00:01:35.780> onto<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:39.340> I'm<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.700> place

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
side down onto that I'm going to place

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.029 
side down onto that I'm going to place
the<00:01:41.689> bead<00:01:41.899> cap<00:01:42.170> down<00:01:42.679> next<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.530> Stardust

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
the bead cap down next and the Stardust

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.929 
the bead cap down next and the Stardust
bead<00:01:46.399> on<00:01:46.700> top<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:48.340> those<00:01:49.340> are<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.579> basic

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
bead on top and those are the basic

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.569 
bead on top and those are the basic
pieces<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:51.200> see<00:01:51.439> they<00:01:51.619> make<00:01:51.770> very<00:01:52.250> cute

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
pieces and see they make very cute

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.179 
pieces and see they make very cute
little<00:01:52.729> trees<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:54.590> we're<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.979> make<00:01:55.159> a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
little trees now we're going to make a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.130 
little trees now we're going to make a
wrapped<00:01:55.490> wire<00:01:55.670> loop<00:01:56.030> I'm<00:01:56.299> gonna<00:01:56.509> use<00:01:56.659> my<00:01:56.869> wire

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
wrapped wire loop I'm gonna use my wire

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.179 
wrapped wire loop I'm gonna use my wire
looping<00:01:57.560> pliers<00:01:58.719> if<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.929> are<00:02:00.770> not<00:02:01.039> familiar

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
looping pliers if you are not familiar

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.620 
looping pliers if you are not familiar
with<00:02:01.429> how<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.640> make<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.819> wrapped<00:02:02.060> wire<00:02:02.210> loop<00:02:02.450> we

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
with how to make a wrapped wire loop we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.020 
with how to make a wrapped wire loop we
do<00:02:02.750> have<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.929> video<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.500> how<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.939> I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
do have a video on how to do that and I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.969 
do have a video on how to do that and I
do<00:02:05.090> show<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.869> video<00:02:05.990> how<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.319> do<00:02:06.830> the

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
do show you in that video how to do the

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.279 
do show you in that video how to do the
loop<00:02:07.159> with<00:02:07.399> just<00:02:07.670> plain<00:02:08.000> chain<00:02:08.959> nose<00:02:09.110> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
loop with just plain chain nose and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.440 
loop with just plain chain nose and
round<00:02:09.470> nose<00:02:09.560> but<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.579> is<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.120> great

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
round nose but this is a really great

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.990 
round nose but this is a really great
time-saving<00:02:12.049> tool<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:13.480> all<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.690> do<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:16.000> grab

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
time-saving tool and all you do is grab

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.479 
time-saving tool and all you do is grab
the<00:02:17.239> wire<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.870> bit<00:02:18.349> above<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> bead<00:02:19.390> squeeze

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the wire a bit above the bead squeeze

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:28.680 
the wire a bit above the bead squeeze
bend<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.670> tail<00:02:23.230> rotate<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.380> around<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:27.019> then

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
bend the tail rotate it around and then

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.000 
bend the tail rotate it around and then
just<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.079> regular<00:02:30.530> wrapped<00:02:30.769> loop

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
just like with a regular wrapped loop

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.600 
just like with a regular wrapped loop
you're<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.489> going<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:33.250> pull<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.400> tail

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you're just going to pull the tail

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
you're just going to pull the tail
around

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.400
