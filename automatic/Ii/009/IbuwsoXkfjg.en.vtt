00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:06.479 
all right so I need to get cracking on

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:07.940 
all right so I need to get cracking on

have<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:19.919> bit<00:00:20.099> of<00:00:20.220> digging<00:00:20.399> and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
have to do a little bit of digging and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.780 
have to do a little bit of digging and
here<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.559> have<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.009> RX<00:00:23.759> so<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.899> a<00:00:24.989> sr<00:00:25.320> 201

motor this is a 5.5 turn so 6,000 kv so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.550 
motor this is a 5.5 turn so 6,000 kv so
scratch<00:00:39.420> salvaged<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:39.900> another<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.380> of<00:00:40.470> my

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
scratch salvaged from another one of my

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.640 
scratch salvaged from another one of my
projects<00:00:41.040> I'll<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.700> fine<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> then

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
projects I'll do fine for this and then

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.480 
projects I'll do fine for this and then
we<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> castle<00:00:44.790> creation<00:00:45.300> s<00:00:45.600> b3

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
we have a castle creation s b3

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.430 
we have a castle creation s b3
Sidewinder<00:00:47.490> 3<00:00:47.760> ESC<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.050> what's<00:00:52.290> going

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
Sidewinder 3 ESC so that's what's going

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
Sidewinder 3 ESC so that's what's going
to<00:00:52.470> get<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.739> guy<00:00:52.950> up<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.250> runnin<00:00:53.520> alright<00:00:54.480> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to get this guy up and runnin alright so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.590 
to get this guy up and runnin alright so
so<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.739> side<00:00:56.630> start<00:00:57.630> our<00:00:57.720> install

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
so this is the side start our install

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.389 
so this is the side start our install
all<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.200> servo<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.309> bit

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
all right so the servo is a little bit

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.249 
all right so the servo is a little bit
smaller<00:01:02.700> than<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.970> expected<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.570> wise<00:01:03.780> anyway

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
smaller than I expected with wise anyway

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.080 
smaller than I expected with wise anyway
so<00:01:04.320> might<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> play<00:01:05.430> around<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> build<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so might have to play around and build a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.340 
so might have to play around and build a
second<00:01:06.420> bracket<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.110> we're<00:01:07.290> just

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
second bracket but for now we're just

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
second bracket but for now we're just
going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> throw<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.009> screw<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.399> one<00:01:08.549> side

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to throw the one screw on one side

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
going to throw the one screw on one side
to<00:01:08.909> hold<00:01:08.999> it<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.359> figure<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.229> bracket

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to hold it in figure out that bracket

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.870 
to hold it in figure out that bracket
piece<00:01:10.799> later

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.490 

all<00:01:17.570> right<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.330> motor<00:01:20.570> throw

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
all right so now on to the motor throw

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.980 
all right so now on to the motor throw
that<00:01:21.710> spot<00:01:22.040> make<00:01:22.490> sure<00:01:22.700> our<00:01:22.729> holes<00:01:23.119> line<00:01:23.450> up<00:01:25.990> to

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
that spot make sure our holes line up to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.560 
that spot make sure our holes line up to
button<00:01:27.380> head<00:01:27.560> screws<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.270> reason<00:01:32.509> I'm

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
button head screws and the reason I'm

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.670 
button head screws and the reason I'm
referring<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.960> button<00:01:33.229> head<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.470> because<00:01:33.649> a

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
referring to button head is because a

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.289 
referring to button head is because a
lot<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.920> countersunk<00:01:34.399> stuff<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:34.820> here<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.000> it's

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
lot of countersunk stuff in here so it's

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.749 
lot of countersunk stuff in here so it's
just<00:01:35.390> one<00:01:35.540> of<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.690> standard<00:01:36.110> screws<00:01:36.380> here

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
just one of the standard screws here

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.160 
just one of the standard screws here
just<00:01:37.759> knock<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:37.940> up<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.210> bit<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.390> more<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.960> fall

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
just knock it up a bit so more to fall

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.170 
just knock it up a bit so more to fall
out<00:01:39.320> into<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.649> adjusting<00:01:40.039> later<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:43.700> here<00:01:43.940> for

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
out into the adjusting later in here for

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.020 
out into the adjusting later in here for
the<00:01:44.299> C<00:01:44.780> I'm<00:01:45.470> gonna<00:01:45.649> be<00:01:45.770> using<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.220> trusty<00:01:46.610> duro

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
the C I'm gonna be using the trusty duro

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.999 
the C I'm gonna be using the trusty duro
tape<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.170> two<00:01:48.920> sided<00:01:49.159> servo<00:01:49.670> tape<00:01:49.880> stuff<00:01:50.539> is
