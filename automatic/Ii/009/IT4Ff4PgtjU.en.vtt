00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.250
 now youtube once again said mike of 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.950
 dj mike events we are going to present you with a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.139
 of our new acquisitions for the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 flame company lighting in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 what events are we going to take it also as 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 a small tutorial we will teach you to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.119
 all the latin people who have been 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 asking a lot very much for this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.980
 product is one of the newest things 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 that came out in the namm 2013 we're going 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.990
 to present this afternoon maybe ladies and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 gentlemen 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 that is a super super compact light what 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.710
 they can carry a child with their hands 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.240
 we can lift it up there is no 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 problems weighs very little 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:45.720
 this is the pine to a thread color bin heli 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 of the difference of him and not of the wine 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.950
 and the wash is that the pin gives him lightning 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 of concentrated light 13 points 5 degrees the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.600
 guaje opens the distance and then 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.700
 paints a much wider area of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 color this is 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.280
 the burgundy wine weighed very little 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.920
 advantage of this compared to other 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 heads the advantage of this is that it's coming 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 with the ice 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 and the good is the isi out that is being 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 the entrance and exit from there and if so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.950
 it is called the cable that has been this 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.920
 cable with this then practically you 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.229
 bridge from one head to another using 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.369
 a single power cable for all your 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.990
 line roughly like this 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 then it is one within a line of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.900
 entrance and a starting line that gives you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.420
 to you the advantage of connecting just one 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.780
 head the first of the line and from there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 is connected in series what is the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 rest of the heads is a head like 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.210
 I say practice is very petite but 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.270
 as they say in English the pack is ironed 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 has a strong punch has a punch 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 very very strong 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.149
 the advantage of this the other difference of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.490
 those heads with the others is coming 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.640
 with a technology that has been r 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.600
 What is the red being the green? 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.270
 blue and now the white is the the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.710
 We will see it white now 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.720
 pretty right now I feel I'm being 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.940
 illuminated by the white of the heads 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 Well ladies and gentlemen this is the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.790
 and no color beam leader 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.879
 now those heads come with a slide 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.940
 new is a slide called cri that 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.069
 it's been very high concentration and 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.650
 because the colors the colors in these 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.010
 heads are very but very rich we are going to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.000
 to do is a small sample I do not have 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.280
 the old heads because it's full 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.170
 this team thing but good this is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.530
 the Red 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.020
 as it may be to see is a very red but 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.890
 very intense 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.910
 the green is strong rich 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.910
 and one of my favorite colors 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.269
 the blue 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.930
 As I say, it's an intense strong blue 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.250
 it is a wine here it is not appreciated much but 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.739
 really light does not spread it this is 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.120
 what is the standard right now 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.390
 in lighting what has been the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.400
 wind now the white comes with the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.520
 technology called white uruguay 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.860
 that is being a pure white 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.020
 an intense white now with the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.210
 combination of red green and blue because 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.780
 I guess you know that you know is 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.420
 meet the combination of the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.370
 purple 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 what is the combination of red 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.300
 and the blue 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.820
 the yellow that is a very yellow bowl 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.550
 that is, they are really with evolution 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.490
 of lady or the evolution of the mixture of 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.430
 colors this yellow if it's a one 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.709
 Real yellow combined s 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.660
 It is acquired with the combination of red 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.000
 and the blue red and the blue give it a 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.620
 yellow and now when you put them on 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.259
 you can all go at waltz time 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.600
 edge of the toast as they have a 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.190
 tremendous lighting and now to give them 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.350
 a very small demonstration after 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.330

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.820

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.840
 events a very small demonstration of 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.840
 what can be with these lights 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.710
 that is a blank 6 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.700
 this program is made by hand they are 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.340
 six steps and then now they are 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.020
 machine is hanging from the sun and already in 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.650
 spaced and well wired as it is a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.910
