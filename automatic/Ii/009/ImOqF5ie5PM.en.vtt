00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.530
 belz a medieval village that was who 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.880
 has developed around the abbey 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.110
 saint-pierre we will have the opportunity to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.760
 discover it later and that's 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.470
 really through the abbey that we have 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.200
 saw the development of this village 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.370
 so we have the religious heart and then we 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.470
 will see later also that we have a 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.200
 little castrato the important then just 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.120
 on the north side we actually have the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.280
 craft districts of the city 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 medieval is in the heart of this neighborhood 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.910
 you have the old hospital which is a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.650
 welcome place which was a place 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.180
 for pilgrims and 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 besides blesle we had a 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.110
 brotherhood so many pilgrims of 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.910
 saint jacques de compostelle and we have a 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.390
 date which is still marked on the entry 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.430
 of the tower 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.769
 and then here we actually start the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.300
 discovery of the ancient holy abbey 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.370
 blesle stone and above all you have 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.380
 on the heights a tower the so-called tower 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.690
 of the haddou farmhouse that very likely to name has 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.390
 been built by the will of one of the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.460
 abbesses to do the counterweight to the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.780
 tour of mercer then the seniors of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.770
 mercor it's an extremely family 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.870
 important and in the middle in fact the 10th 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.700
 century they came to settle 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.110
 first to protect the abbey 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.790
 saint-pierre de blesle and then 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 quickly they had other interests 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.750
 seigniorial but that actually spawned 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.970
 this mercenary's presence a struggle 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.070
 extremely important between power 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.430
 abbey and the seigniorial power of 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.430
 markers 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.670
 he 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 we 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.510
 so we are at the headdress museum 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710
 so actually you have in his 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.369
 showcases showcases 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.470
 it was good to wear our grandfathers 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.009
 since well for a very long 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.920
 period 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.509
 until the very beginning of the 20th century the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.280
 women should not be haired 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.900
 then you find them obviously 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.940
 high-loire headdresses 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.950
 volleyball and we also had the departments 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.950
 Boundaries of the Cantal and Puy de Dome 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.659
 so we are now ready to 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.030
 bedside of the saint-pierre church 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.930
 blesle and we discover the absidioles which 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.760
 are adorned of course with decorative motifs 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.319
 ornamental and above all you have under the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.930
 cornice a whole series of modillons 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.370
 which obviously reminds the heart of 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.829
 medieval bestiary medieval 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.599
 with figures zomor makes figures 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.329
 anthropomorphic we also see some 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.250
 ornamental details through 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.680
 flowers that we will find elsewhere 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.189
 the entrance to the portal of the holy church 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.189
 stone gall 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.460
 and 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.460
 I 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.560
 we are inside a party 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.600
 of the bedside in the apsidioles and what 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.220
 is remarkable here is the presence of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.170
 these painted decorations then there are 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.090
 actually the most ads 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.190
 important are the settings of the 19th century 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.630
 but especially through the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.410
 restorations that were extremely 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.720
 important 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.890
 we have been able to uncover decorations that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.560
 date from medieval times 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.320
 so we guess at the top of the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.500
 angels musicians who are very dated 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.930
 probably from the fifteenth century we also 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.340
 entire female figures and then we 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.840
 will then find other 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.500
 representations as a saint 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.350
 christophe 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.360
 so in the main ship so here 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.190
 we are indeed in the treasure 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.390
 of the saint-pierre de blaise church but 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.520
 we are especially in the heart of 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.070
 ladies the particularity of this space 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.310
 it is that it has been on the ocean is closed 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.970
 for then in this space the soul has been 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.830
 put in place 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.260
 a treasure you have mostly of very 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.990
 beautiful carved works so here we have 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.770
 a representation of saint-anne 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.100
 Trinitarian it is actually the virgin who 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.870
 with his mom and son are 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.709
 represented is a work so there in 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.690
 white then in space so that is 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.370
 dedicated to the treasure we have a work 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.650
 remarkable thirteenth century which 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.510
 actually represents a maiden in majesty 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.990
 unfortunately so christ 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.990
 present today 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.919
 but 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.319
 so we have a very beautiful wooden work 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.990
 polychrome that it was the thirteenth century 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.550
 and gold actually it lacks some 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.039
 elements in a few members especially in 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.620
 upper part but we have a job 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.210
 which is extremely advanced at the level of 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 father's treatment is omnium but 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.310
 also at the level of processing the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.310
 hair 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.560
 we are very close to the path 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.550
 Roman which is one of the tributaries of the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.010
 river to lannion and we are well in a 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.080
 neighborhood that has been heavily used since 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.210
 all the time and we just have the back 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.030
 the old cemetery the cemetery we have 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.680
 out of medieval wood and then we got 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.650
 especially a chapel the chapel of the 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.820
 chain that was therefore built at 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.820
 middle of the seventeenth century 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.740
 we 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.880
 and 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.070
 2 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.470
 no 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.310
 so 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.310
 we 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.310
 Oh 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.390
 we 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.550
 he 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.750
 but 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
 m
