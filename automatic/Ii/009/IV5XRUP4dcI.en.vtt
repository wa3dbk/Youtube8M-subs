00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:11.969
 site all point dot 706 task 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.870
 father is 20 years older than son and younger 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.100
 father is five times how old is father and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.939
 how old is your son 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 we have two cases in this case 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.400
 unknown we do not know how old father 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.279
 and do not know how old son 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.219
 let's mark for x i recommend for x 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.540
 denotes the smallest value 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:38.930
 Of course the son is less years old therefore 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 let the number of years which son is x 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 x 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 this is the number of years to the son then how much 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 father father is five times older then 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.809
 father's age is 5 x 5 x this is age 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 Father, you can write words here x 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.369
 let it be for this x 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 son then dressed five times his senior on 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 account father 5x further we know that father 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.930
 eldest son by 20 years there is a difference in 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.960
 they are 20 years old father is older 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.049
 twenty years how to know the age difference 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.880
 need to subtract from age 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:37.430
 age younger and we will find out the difference 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.430
 age namely 20 years old 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.510
 if we subtract x from 5 x, we get 4 x 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.420
 This as from five chocolate subtract 1 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.850
 chocolate will be 4 chocolates or out of 5 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.740
 apples subtract 1 apple will be four 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 apples how else can it be 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.090
 write x 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.530
 if we multiply by 1 nothing changes 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.520
 and 1 multiplied by x is still x further 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:19.100
 we can x can take out then 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.280
 brackets what remains is 5 minus 1 x carried out 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.180
 for brackets in brackets 5 minus 1 well, usually 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.720
 this line is missing 5 minus 1k 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.100
 only 44 x usually pieces skip 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 can write can not write like this 6 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.500
 seconds see factor multiplier 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.670
 piece to find one of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 multipliers need to divide the product 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.850
 to another multiplier if we divide 20 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:00.739
 4 will be 5x if you remember it was 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:12.440
 son age and so son 5 years old if father 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:15.700
 five times older then father 25 years 25 years 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.739
 more than five years just for 20 years and 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.690
 25 years is five times more than five years 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.850
 so in the son of 5 years 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.410
 father is 25 years old 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.790
 My name is Andrei Andreevich 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.860
 site all point dot ru 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.200
 write in the comments is it clear 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.670
 decision if you like my videos 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.070
 please advise and friends 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.070
 classmate on this all all bye
