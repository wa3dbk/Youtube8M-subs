we see some prototype parts today for
some<00:00:36.730> seat<00:00:37.030> testing<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:38.140> we<00:00:38.710> also<00:00:38.830> have<00:00:39.670> some

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880

some seat testing and we also have some
material<00:00:40.300> classics<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:40.810> dropped<00:00:41.080> off<00:00:41.200> to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530

I<00:00:43.540> had<00:00:44.110> some<00:00:44.380> interior<00:00:44.800> classics<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.340> way

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
I had some interior classics in the way

I had some interior classics in the way
normally<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.970> know<00:00:46.060> just<00:00:46.300> step<00:00:46.660> around<00:00:46.780> and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
normally you know just step around and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.100 
normally you know just step around and
not<00:00:47.170> worry<00:00:47.530> about<00:00:47.590> it<00:00:47.860> too<00:00:48.010> much<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:50.080> know

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110

they<00:00:50.380> had<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.710> try<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.640> get<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> plastic<00:00:52.450> parts

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
they had to try to get the plastic parts

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.530 
they had to try to get the plastic parts
to<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.870> moved<00:00:53.170> on<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.410> way<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.590> I<00:00:53.740> could<00:00:53.860> get<00:00:54.040> to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
to be moved on the way so I could get to

to be moved on the way so I could get to
the<00:00:55.540> seats<00:00:55.780> took<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.080> little<00:00:56.200> longer<00:00:56.500> than

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
the seats took a little longer than

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.260 
the seats took a little longer than
normal<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.130> it's<00:00:57.280> definitely<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> lot<00:00:58.210> more

walking over at the other plant or
jumping<00:01:20.080> in<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.259> car<00:01:20.440> real<00:01:20.619> quick<00:01:20.910> today<00:01:21.910> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
jumping in the car real quick today I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.040 
jumping in the car real quick today I
just<00:01:23.619> thought<00:01:23.830> up<00:01:23.979> going<00:01:24.220> over<00:01:24.369> there

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
just thought up going over there

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.680 
just thought up going over there
it<00:01:26.290> was<00:01:26.500> more<00:01:26.680> difficult<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.119> I<00:01:28.210> get<00:01:28.509> there

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
it was more difficult how do I get there

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.690 
it was more difficult how do I get there
what's<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.050> best<00:01:29.350> path<00:01:29.800> what<00:01:30.130> door<00:01:30.369> should<00:01:30.580> I

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
what's the best path what door should I

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.460 
what's the best path what door should I
use<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.570> things<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.900> would<00:01:32.050> never<00:01:32.170> normally

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
use the things I would never normally

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:48.749 
use the things I would never normally
consider

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.370

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
actually I was wondering if we don't me

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:16.990 
actually I was wondering if we don't me
like<00:01:51.560> an<00:01:51.710> item<00:01:51.890> number

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
