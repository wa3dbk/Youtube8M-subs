00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.890 
bit of sense no wouldn't I don't want it
to<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.239> either<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:21.160> don't<00:03:22.160> want<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> either

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
to be either I don't want it to either

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.640 
to be either I don't want it to either
but<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.350> might<00:03:24.500> be<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.709> way<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:26.650> lay

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
but I think it might be the way I lay

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.250 
but I think it might be the way I lay
next<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:28.100> nothing<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:29.020> think<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:30.080> might<00:03:30.200> be

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
next to nothing I think it might be

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.009 
next to nothing I think it might be
though<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.750> would<00:03:35.870> make<00:03:35.989> sense

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
though because it would make sense

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.780 
though because it would make sense
because<00:03:36.320> one<00:03:36.590> person<00:03:36.890> go<00:03:36.980> home<00:03:37.130> next<00:03:37.250> thursday

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
because one person go home next thursday

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.130 
because one person go home next thursday
and<00:03:38.890> then<00:03:39.890> five<00:03:40.880> days<00:03:40.910> for<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.570> last<00:03:41.780> three

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
and then five days for the last three

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.890 
and then five days for the last three
and<00:03:43.130> at<00:03:43.340> least<00:03:43.459> 75<00:03:43.940> days<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.630> was<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and at least 75 days and that was the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:56.270 
and at least 75 days and that was the
back<00:03:45.080> well<00:03:45.350> that's<00:03:45.500> what<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.709> signed<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:46.040> for
