00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Talk youtube beauty like you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.810
 title of the video already said that it is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.570
 making a headset multilaser 5.1 box 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.910
 but because 5.1 defendant is because in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.490
 truth there are two types of 75 point 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.670
 11 that are those that have a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 wheel in each ear and I want to put mix 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 I do not know how it works right to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 technology that emulates audio in 360 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.660
 degrees and real 15.1 is that it has 3 to 1 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 steering wheel each ear one day a front 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.329
 a rear and a central one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.239
 and if from here I bought a submarine more 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.270
 Why are you looking at the packaging? 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.430
 but because of the guarantee because I have 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.379
 Very bad luck with headphones and I already 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 I got it with extended warranty three years 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.010
 it took them so long to deliver 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 that was won by the guilt of logic 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:00.930
 the fault of the carrier that I found 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:19.200
 this three years and play with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:21.000
 my knife for cutting bread was even has 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.070
 remember to buy a stiletto help 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.509
 much in these hours hours until you cut 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.780
 packing in marking once the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780
 Cashier 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 so this is a multilaser headset 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.340
 there was a bit on the Internet was 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 seeking the best cost-benefit is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 champions that I found there looked like 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.940
 be great but they were like that and close to 400 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.590
 real 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660
 and if from here I got to buy percent 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.600
 39 was discounted there inclusive 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.790
 tried free market cheaper but it is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.290
 to fulfill even a small submarine more 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.290
 because of the extended warranty 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.290
 before opening he looks at the headset that I 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.390
 I was using this to be a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.950
 better upgrade who does not have much to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.870
 complain said it did not help me much 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.200
 especially when taking hs from my 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:49.470
 colleagues there already gave to get it 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:55.310
 Calm down, so here first is the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.840
 tower which will be connected which will 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.540
 connect to the computer as well 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.820
 only has independent volume controls 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.280
 rear central and front control 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 volume it usually to turn on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.820
 off the microphone and here to call 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.360
 an external microphone has two more 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.170
 other headphones to 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.870
 having a P2 entry keyboard ps2 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.290
 But there's more to it if I'm not mistaken. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.239
 here behind the rear connection that already 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.250
 has before output audio input 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:34.230
 pro dvd on your computer and here is 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.970
 vice is the one of the energy can the source 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.970
 this is all there is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.170
 the little head that will turn on the computer 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.170
 in the fucking microphone 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.100
 here also another cable crc the excuse is 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.470
 male and you will also need to be 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.530
 Computer is obvious that only have prices 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.090
 night computers 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:18.850
 this is a microphone plugin is 3.5 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:25.660
 to 6.5 you can connect the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:32.170
 microphone somewhere else could use 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:36.750
 this microphone is another device that is 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:43.240
 to connect to the DVD player and the tower 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:45.520
 and the headset will also be there I researched 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.690
 a little more than enough precision 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 although it should be the source 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.870
 some factors called food 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.050
 external crime is not that he only calls 77 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.370
 at the computer you already have power 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:11.050
 This has to be connected here, it's unique. 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:12.880
 entry is obvious and this is the 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:19.009
 main 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.900
 It's the headset, we're very handsome, not really. 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.000
 I know if you can see the camera by shooting 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.770
 by nokia n8 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.509
 You can see the three speakers I have. 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.789
 where is the central 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.560
 and if from here it is the front that is the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.630
 back to that audio effect 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.090
 had I catch a reflection of the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.410
 light on a damage 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 walk so I will not try to boot and 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.910
 me I do not want to have to break in the first 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.590
 day - he still here in his cable too 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.800
 It has volume control and call and 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.370
 off the microphone should not be low 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.500
 microphone is turned off and the microphone 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.289
 high sensitivity front volume 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:09.500
 locating on volume bring volume 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:15.650
 Central to this here 10 the overall volume of the 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:24.470
 totally malleable microphone to 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:30.800
 You adjust your taste as you call it. 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:36.820
 here in arches and there it rains that has a 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:43.909
 angle of one of the 90 degree sun 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:46.240
 actually decrease so vertical and 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.260
 horizontal 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.060
 so this is it people who are 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.220
 Thinking About Buying A Headset Hour 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.320
 full that super cheap in the free market 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.300
 must think of r $ 90 is also a note 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.940
 I do not think there's much is not 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.500
 just so you can see what's in the box 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.389
 to check if everything is right 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.919
 explaining how you connect the two in 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.099
 tower on the computer after I take a 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:13.970
 look but I think it's simple to be you 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:18.610
 too much packaging the multilaser 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:21.950
 even though it's super cheap 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.529
 That's cool, that's who. 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.969
 is planning to invest in network 75 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.459
 point remembering 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:32.089
 for better audio quality on the 

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:34.689
 games mainly play cal dante is the 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:38.239
 a new one will now be 14 too 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:39.979
 here I recommend from here I have not tested 

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:44.239
 no more from what I saw on the internet alone 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:47.839
 has positive criticism and for those who 

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:50.929
 can pay a racer nardino 400 reais 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:52.489
 one of the souls this here I think it's a 

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:56.469
 good choice 

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:56.469
 That's it, thanks. Bye, and bye.
