research objective was was to really

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.950 
research objective was was to really
just<00:00:25.580> kind<00:00:25.730> of<00:00:25.760> understand<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.540> nature<00:00:26.750> of

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
just kind of understand the nature of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.750 
just kind of understand the nature of
safety<00:00:27.410> events<00:00:27.740> in<00:00:27.860> this<00:00:27.950> context<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.700> the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
safety events in this context and the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.270 
safety events in this context and the
contributors<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:29.480> those<00:00:30.280> understanding

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
contributors to those understanding

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.160 
contributors to those understanding
safety<00:00:31.670> is<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:31.790> really<00:00:32.149> understanding<00:00:32.899> safety

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
safety is a really understanding safety

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.329 
safety is a really understanding safety
event<00:00:33.379> is<00:00:33.469> really<00:00:33.589> important<00:00:34.039> improving

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
event is really important improving

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.189 
event is really important improving
quality<00:00:34.579> for<00:00:34.969> emergency<00:00:35.390> services<00:00:35.809> for<00:00:36.019> kids

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
quality for emergency services for kids

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.689 
quality for emergency services for kids
and<00:00:36.379> we<00:00:36.530> really<00:00:36.800> don't<00:00:37.039> know<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.370> lot<00:00:37.670> about

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
and we really don't know a lot about

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.369 
and we really don't know a lot about
this<00:00:38.089> yet<00:00:38.329> there's<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.870> lot<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.170> information

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
this yet there's a lot of information

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.290 
this yet there's a lot of information
about<00:00:39.800> sort<00:00:40.489> of<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.640> safety<00:00:40.850> events<00:00:41.149> in<00:00:41.239> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
about sort of the safety events in the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.700 
about sort of the safety events in the
hospital<00:00:41.719> context<00:00:42.079> but<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.409> pre-hospital

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
hospital context but in the pre-hospital

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.110 
hospital context but in the pre-hospital
context<00:00:43.339> there's<00:00:43.519> a<00:00:43.609> lack<00:00:43.789> of<00:00:43.820> information

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
context there's a lack of information

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.540 
context there's a lack of information
especially<00:00:44.600> with<00:00:45.050> regard<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.379> kids<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.429> what

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
especially with regard to kids so what

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.919 
especially with regard to kids so what
we<00:00:46.640> did<00:00:46.789> in<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.030> phase<00:00:47.269> of<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.449> project<00:00:47.510> this

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
we did in this phase of the project this

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.520 
we did in this phase of the project this
is<00:00:48.079> phase<00:00:48.319> one<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.769> larger<00:00:49.159> NIH<00:00:49.670> ro1<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.600> I

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
emergency room doctors and we asked them

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.010 
emergency room doctors and we asked them
a<00:01:10.820> range<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.210> questions<00:01:11.360> they<00:01:11.659> were<00:01:11.750> fairly

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
a range of questions they were fairly

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.510 
a range of questions they were fairly
open-ended<00:01:12.439> but<00:01:12.710> we<00:01:12.829> wanted<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:13.189> get<00:01:13.399> an

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
open-ended but we wanted to just get an

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.859 
open-ended but we wanted to just get an
idea<00:01:13.820> from<00:01:14.030> them<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.450> people<00:01:14.689> on<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
idea from them the people on the

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.420 
idea from them the people on the
frontlines<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:15.590> are<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:16.310> are<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
frontlines what are the what are the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.800 
frontlines what are the what are the
types<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.880> safety<00:01:17.210> events<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.539> would<00:01:17.689> prefer

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
types of safety events you would prefer

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.630 
types of safety events you would prefer
that<00:01:18.049> occur<00:01:18.409> in<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> pre-hospital<00:01:19.039> care<00:01:19.430> of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
that occur in the pre-hospital care of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.980 
that occur in the pre-hospital care of
children<00:01:19.820> is<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.149> something<00:01:20.509> we<00:01:20.600> don't<00:01:20.780> even

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
children is that something we don't even

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.190 
children is that something we don't even
know<00:01:21.770> yet<00:01:22.119> what<00:01:23.119> contributes<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.659> them<00:01:23.869> are

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
know yet what contributes to them are

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.779 
know yet what contributes to them are
there<00:01:24.350> sort<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.619> communication<00:01:25.219> issues<00:01:25.579> are

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
there sort of communication issues are

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.940 
there sort of communication issues are
there<00:01:25.909> technical<00:01:26.869> issues<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.409> we<00:01:27.560> talked

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
there technical issues so we talked

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.530 
there technical issues so we talked
about<00:01:28.039> these<00:01:28.280> things<00:01:28.490> like<00:01:28.640> this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
about these things like this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.270 
about these things like this
and<00:01:30.020> I'll<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.320> say<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.500> in<00:01:30.860> case<00:01:31.010> you're<00:01:31.190> not

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
and I'll just say to in case you're not

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.220 
and I'll just say to in case you're not
familiar<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.760> pre-hospital<00:01:32.150> context<00:01:33.050> what

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
familiar the pre-hospital context what

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.450 
familiar the pre-hospital context what
we're<00:01:33.350> talking<00:01:33.650> about<00:01:33.770> is<00:01:33.980> from<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.220> time

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
we're talking about is from the time

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220 
we're talking about is from the time
that<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:35.120> first<00:01:35.330> responders<00:01:35.840> would<00:01:35.990> arrive

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
that the first responders would arrive

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.620 
that the first responders would arrive
at<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> scene<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.010> then<00:01:37.640> throughout<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
at the scene and then throughout the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.060 
at the scene and then throughout the
time<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.050> they<00:01:39.140> transport<00:01:39.620> them<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
time that they transport them to the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.830 
time that they transport them to the
hospital<00:01:40.120> so<00:01:41.120> that's<00:01:41.300> kind<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:41.720> we're

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
hospital so that's kind of what we're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.620 
hospital so that's kind of what we're
looking<00:01:41.870> at<00:01:42.230> there<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:44.120> we<00:01:44.240> found<00:01:44.450> some<00:01:44.510> really

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
looking at there so we found some really

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.020 
looking at there so we found some really
interesting<00:01:44.840> results<00:01:45.650> overall<00:01:46.520> I'll<00:01:46.850> just

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
interesting results overall I'll just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.700 
interesting results overall I'll just
say<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.480> there's<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.870> range<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.350> factors<00:01:48.470> that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
say that there's a range of factors that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.080 
say that there's a range of factors that
contribute<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.520> what<00:01:49.730> we<00:01:49.820> did<00:01:49.970> with

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
contribute to this and what we did with

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.490 
contribute to this and what we did with
our<00:01:50.240> results<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.660> tried<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> put<00:01:51.110> them<00:01:51.260> into<00:01:51.410> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
our results is tried to put them into a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.890 
our results is tried to put them into a
framework<00:01:51.830> this<00:01:52.100> ecological<00:01:52.760> framework<00:01:52.910> to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
framework this ecological framework to

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.810 
framework this ecological framework to
show<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.290> there<00:01:54.440> are<00:01:54.470> there<00:01:54.980> are<00:01:55.010> factors

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
show that there are there are factors

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.250 
show that there are there are factors
that<00:01:55.970> contribute<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.420> safety<00:01:56.780> events<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.140> the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
that contribute to safety events of the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.680 
that contribute to safety events of the
individual<00:01:57.800> EMS<00:01:58.010> provider<00:01:58.520> level<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.150> at<00:01:59.510> the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
individual EMS provider level and at the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.780 
individual EMS provider level and at the
level<00:01:59.870> of<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> family<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.980> child<00:02:01.370> because<00:02:01.700> we

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
level of the family and child because we

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.950 
level of the family and child because we
kids<00:02:02.090> we're<00:02:02.270> not<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.510> looking<00:02:02.750> at<00:02:02.870> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
kids we're not just looking at the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.990 
kids we're not just looking at the
individual<00:02:03.770> patient<00:02:04.160> but<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.400> family<00:02:04.760> really

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
individual patient but the family really

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900 
individual patient but the family really
plays<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> big<00:02:05.510> role<00:02:05.540> then<00:02:06.350> there<00:02:06.530> were<00:02:06.910> factors

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
plays a big role then there were factors

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.490 
plays a big role then there were factors
at<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.030> team<00:02:08.300> level<00:02:08.540> for<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.869> communication

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
at the team level for the communication

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.650 
at the team level for the communication
with<00:02:09.619> other<00:02:09.770> team<00:02:10.040> members<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.640> as<00:02:11.330> well<00:02:11.540> as

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
with other team members and as well as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.350 
with other team members and as well as
factors<00:02:12.020> at<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.290> system<00:02:12.680> level<00:02:12.970> EMS<00:02:13.970> system

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
factors at the system level EMS system

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.210 
factors at the system level EMS system
level<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:15.650> are<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:15.920> environmental

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
level and there are also environmental

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.710 
level and there are also environmental
factors<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.030> can't<00:02:17.210> do<00:02:17.330> anything<00:02:17.510> about

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
factors that we can't do anything about

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.270 
factors that we can't do anything about
but<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.290> we're<00:02:18.440> really<00:02:18.590> trying<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.010> look<00:02:19.130> at

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
but what we're really trying to look at

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.040 
but what we're really trying to look at
is<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.520> factors<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:19.880> we<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.270> modify<00:02:20.600> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
is the factors that we can modify and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.199 
is the factors that we can modify and
that<00:02:21.860> are<00:02:21.980> important<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.459> understand<00:02:22.940> better

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
that are important to understand better

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.900 
that are important to understand better
so<00:02:23.450> some<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> key<00:02:23.959> findings<00:02:24.380> were<00:02:24.530> that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
so some of the key findings were that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.000 
so some of the key findings were that
the<00:02:25.910> EMS<00:02:26.330> providers<00:02:26.810> had<00:02:26.990> really<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> little

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the EMS providers had really a little

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.150 
the EMS providers had really a little
experience<00:02:28.640> working<00:02:28.850> with<00:02:29.090> kids<00:02:29.860> these<00:02:30.860> kind

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
experience working with kids these kind

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.440 
experience working with kids these kind
of<00:02:31.250> calls<00:02:31.520> with<00:02:31.670> kids<00:02:31.910> don't<00:02:32.120> come<00:02:32.240> along

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
of calls with kids don't come along

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.790 
of calls with kids don't come along
happens<00:02:33.020> they<00:02:33.200> don't<00:02:33.230> have<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> lot<00:02:33.709> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
happens they don't have a lot of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.590 
happens they don't have a lot of
hands-on<00:02:34.100> experience<00:02:34.130> nor<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.330> really

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
hands-on experience nor is this really

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.630 
hands-on experience nor is this really
addressed<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:35.989> much<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.260> their<00:02:36.380> training<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
addressed in much of their training and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
addressed in much of their training and
so<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.360> would<00:02:39.140> bring<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.440> lot<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.650> anxiety

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
so it would bring up a lot of anxiety

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.290 
so it would bring up a lot of anxiety
when<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.190> call<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.610> kid<00:02:40.790> came<00:02:40.970> along<00:02:41.180> both

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
when a call with a kid came along both

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.850 
when a call with a kid came along both
because<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.750> lack<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.110> experience<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.709> they

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because of lack of experience and they

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.990 
because of lack of experience and they
just<00:02:42.980> feel<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.190> there's<00:02:43.430> these<00:02:43.520> high<00:02:43.700> stakes

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
just feel like there's these high stakes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.479 
just feel like there's these high stakes
with<00:02:44.209> children<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> deal<00:02:46.250> with<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
with children you have to deal with the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.979 
with children you have to deal with the
family<00:02:46.880> as<00:02:46.970> well<00:02:47.000> as<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.420> child<00:02:47.690> and

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
family as well as the child and

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.660 
family as well as the child and
sometimes<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.560> can<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.890> challenging<00:02:49.550> as

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
sometimes that can be challenging as

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.310 
sometimes that can be challenging as
well<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.090> try<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.300> figure<00:02:50.959> out<00:02:51.080> how<00:02:51.260> to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
well so try to figure out how to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.360 
well so try to figure out how to
communicate<00:02:51.530> with<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> number<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.280> different

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
communicate with a number of different

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.890 
communicate with a number of different
people<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.090> often<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.450> child<00:02:53.630> themselves

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
people and often the child themselves

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
people and often the child themselves
can't<00:02:54.320> communicate

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
can't communicate

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.360 
can't communicate
and<00:02:56.549> more<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.420> addition<00:02:58.170> technically<00:02:58.860> there

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and more in addition technically there

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.240 
and more in addition technically there
are<00:02:59.900> there<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.079> not<00:03:01.230> sort<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> standardized

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
are there are not sort of standardized

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.009 
are there are not sort of standardized
medication<00:03:03.030> dosages<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:03.540> kids<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:03.959> is

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
medication dosages for kids this is

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.420 
medication dosages for kids this is
something<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:04.500> they<00:03:04.590> all<00:03:04.769> brought<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.250> so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
something that they all brought up so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.800 
something that they all brought up so
when<00:03:05.549> you're<00:03:05.670> an<00:03:05.730> emergency<00:03:06.180> situation<00:03:06.750> and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
when you're an emergency situation and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.119 
when you're an emergency situation and
they<00:03:06.959> need<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.230> administer<00:03:07.439> medication

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
they need to administer medication

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.440 
they need to administer medication
you're<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.819> have<00:03:08.939> to<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.120> looking

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you're going to have to be looking

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.490 
you're going to have to be looking
through<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.629> book<00:03:09.689> or<00:03:10.019> something<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.319> try<00:03:10.439> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
through a book or something to try to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.610 
through a book or something to try to
figure<00:03:10.829> out<00:03:11.010> what<00:03:12.170> medication<00:03:13.170> doses<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
figure out what medication doses you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.140 
figure out what medication doses you
should<00:03:13.799> give<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.159> child<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.819> could

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
should give to this child so that could

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
should give to this child so that could
predisposed<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.750> error<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
predisposed to error in a really

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.369 
predisposed to error in a really
stressful<00:03:16.950> situation<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.629> finally<00:03:19.079> another

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
stressful situation and finally another

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.780 
stressful situation and finally another
another<00:03:19.799> one<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.129> highlights<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.549> came

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
another one of the highlights that came

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.860 
another one of the highlights that came
out<00:03:20.939> is<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.150> there<00:03:21.329> wasn't<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.599> lot<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
out is that there wasn't a lot of

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.970 
out is that there wasn't a lot of
communication<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:22.620> from<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.920> emergency

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
communication back from the emergency

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.460 
communication back from the emergency
department<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.329> EMS<00:03:24.750> personnel<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.379> they

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
department to the EMS personnel so they

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.780 
department to the EMS personnel so they
don't<00:03:25.650> often<00:03:25.799> know<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.189> happens<00:03:26.519> with<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
don't often know what happens with the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.240 
don't often know what happens with the
case<00:03:26.970> they<00:03:27.720> don't<00:03:27.840> know<00:03:28.019> if<00:03:28.260> they<00:03:28.650> really

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
case they don't know if they really

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
case they don't know if they really
think<00:03:29.639> they<00:03:29.940> made<00:03:30.090> an<00:03:30.180> error<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.389> had<00:03:30.690> an

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
think they made an error that had an

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.259 
think they made an error that had an
impact<00:03:31.079> or<00:03:31.349> if<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.769> didn't<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.819> there<00:03:33.000> there's

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
impact or if it didn't so there there's

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.970 
impact or if it didn't so there there's
really<00:03:33.420> an<00:03:33.780> inability<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.260> learn<00:03:34.590> from<00:03:34.799> their

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
really an inability to learn from their

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.440 
really an inability to learn from their
mistakes<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.549> their<00:03:35.670> successes<00:03:36.030> because

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
mistakes for their successes because

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.050 
mistakes for their successes because
there's<00:03:36.599> not<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.930> communication<00:03:37.590> channel

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
there's not that communication channel

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.490 
there's not that communication channel
and<00:03:39.060> finally<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:39.900> sort<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.170> culture

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
and finally there was sort of a culture

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.349 
and finally there was sort of a culture
among<00:03:40.680> EMS<00:03:41.040> personnel<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.549> not<00:03:41.790> report<00:03:42.180> your

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
among EMS personnel to not report your

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.089 
among EMS personnel to not report your
errors<00:03:42.659> so<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.260> kind<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> keep<00:03:43.680> those<00:03:43.859> on

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
errors so you just kind of keep those on

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.460 
errors so you just kind of keep those on
your<00:03:44.250> knees<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:45.150> don't<00:03:45.750> report<00:03:46.049> your<00:03:46.230> peer

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
your knees you don't report your peer

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.869 
your knees you don't report your peer
partners<00:03:47.069> errors<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.459> don't<00:03:47.609> report

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
partners errors and you don't report

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.420 
partners errors and you don't report
your<00:03:48.030> honor<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.889> ultimately<00:03:49.889> what<00:03:50.250> these

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
your honor so ultimately what these

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.949 
your honor so ultimately what these
results<00:03:50.849> will<00:03:50.970> do<00:03:51.090> they're<00:03:51.389> going<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.629> inform

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
results will do they're going to inform

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.869 
results will do they're going to inform
a<00:03:52.049> Delphi<00:03:52.560> survey<00:03:53.069> which<00:03:53.310> will<00:03:53.459> be<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> survey

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
a Delphi survey which will be a survey

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.910 
a Delphi survey which will be a survey
that<00:03:54.090> will<00:03:54.239> go<00:03:54.389> up<00:03:54.540> nationally<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.439> EMS

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
that will go up nationally to EMS

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.129 
that will go up nationally to EMS
leaders<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.760> sort<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.030> come<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.329> consensus<00:03:57.959> and

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
leaders to sort of come to consensus and

leaders to sort of come to consensus and
what<00:03:58.319> are<00:03:58.409> some<00:03:58.439> of<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.829> key<00:03:59.040> indicators<00:03:59.900> for

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
what are some of the key indicators for

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.449 
what are some of the key indicators for
safety<00:04:01.169> for<00:04:01.319> measuring<00:04:01.680> safety<00:04:02.040> events<00:04:02.340> in

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
safety for measuring safety events in
