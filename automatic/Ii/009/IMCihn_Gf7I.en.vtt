semi-pro pictures and video you you know

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.440 
semi-pro pictures and video you you know
you<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> gotta<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you kind of gotta go with this but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
you kind of gotta go with this but
that's<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:53.240> most<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> i<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's not most people and i think the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.959 
that's not most people and i think the
convenience<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> why<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
convenience of it is why that it is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
convenience of it is why that it is
replacing<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.780> point<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.140> shoot<00:02:01.290> camera<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
replacing the point and shoot camera it

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
replacing the point and shoot camera it
