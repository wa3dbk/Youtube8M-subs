 because the zombies 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.059

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.499
 sexual transmission sometimes by others who said 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.440

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.980
 she is herself 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.010
 that says the letter 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.810
 the lips 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.370
 good following these some small inconveniences with our guest who 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.659
 was 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.250
 not planned in the program 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.410

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.910
 not 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 because in fact early chords first goal it's pretty difficult 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.780
 we learn that we agree we are all happy that our pace we are 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 happy alliance not just a piece 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.110

 and a third part in which we will see how to work a 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.379
 series of agreements
