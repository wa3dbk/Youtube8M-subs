and then you're also going to need about
three<00:01:07.929> cloves<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.770> garlic<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.640> you're<00:01:10.060> going

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.060 
won't have such a strong garlic flavor
of<00:01:21.549> course<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.960> garlic<00:01:23.380> just<00:01:23.619> gives<00:01:23.920> it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
of course and the garlic just gives it

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.950 
of course and the garlic just gives it
such<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.429> nice<00:01:24.789> flavor<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.539> can<00:01:28.810> just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
such a nice flavor so you can just

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.200 
such a nice flavor so you can just
sprinkle<00:01:29.259> those<00:01:29.649> right<00:01:30.130> over<00:01:30.399> top<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.999> your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210

sprinkle those right over top of your
cauliflower<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.740> then<00:01:39.039> you're<00:01:39.189> going<00:01:39.429> to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
cauliflower and then you're going to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.179 
cauliflower and then you're going to
need<00:01:39.729> about<00:01:39.850> two<00:01:40.450> tablespoons<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.619> olive<00:01:41.859> oil

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
need about two tablespoons of olive oil

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.529 
need about two tablespoons of olive oil
and<00:01:42.579> you're<00:01:42.729> just<00:01:42.850> going<00:01:42.999> to<00:01:43.060> want<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.299> drizzle

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
and you're just going to want to drizzle

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:53.960 
and you're just going to want to drizzle
that<00:01:43.899> right<00:01:44.229> over<00:01:44.499> top

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.679 

and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.409> also<00:01:56.860> put<00:01:57.100> lemon<00:01:57.790> juice<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.270> love

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
and then I also put lemon juice I love

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.530 
and then I also put lemon juice I love
the<00:01:58.900> way<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.530> flavors<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.670> cauliflower<00:02:01.030> you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
the way it flavors the cauliflower you

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.510 
the way it flavors the cauliflower you
could<00:02:01.750> definitely<00:02:01.960> leave<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.860> out<00:02:03.070> if<00:02:03.310> you

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
could definitely leave this out if you

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.380 
could definitely leave this out if you
don't<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:04.470> lemon<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.520> put<00:02:06.759> about<00:02:06.880> two

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
don't like lemon but I put about two

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.510 
don't like lemon but I put about two
tablespoons<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:08.380> lemon<00:02:08.590> juice<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.250> didn't

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
tablespoons of lemon juice and I didn't

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.309 
tablespoons of lemon juice and I didn't
have<00:02:09.789> enough<00:02:10.090> fresh<00:02:10.390> lemon<00:02:10.810> juice<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.260> you

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
have enough fresh lemon juice so you

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.620 
have enough fresh lemon juice so you
could<00:02:11.709> definitely<00:02:12.459> use<00:02:12.880> fresh<00:02:13.510> lemon<00:02:13.540> juice

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
could definitely use fresh lemon juice

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.229 
could definitely use fresh lemon juice
and<00:02:16.769> then<00:02:17.769> you're<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.280> add<00:02:18.640> some<00:02:18.940> fresh

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
and then you're going to add some fresh

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.080 
and then you're going to add some fresh
ground<00:02:19.540> pepper<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:20.380> put<00:02:20.890> quite<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.280> bit<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.849> mean

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
ground pepper I put quite a bit I mean

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.199 
ground pepper I put quite a bit I mean
definitely<00:02:22.780> not<00:02:23.380> too<00:02:23.650> much<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.519> put<00:02:24.819> quite

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
definitely not too much but I put quite

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.479 
definitely not too much but I put quite
a<00:02:25.269> bit<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.959> season<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.500> well<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.380

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and I just um like if I just wrapped it

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.800 
and I just um like if I just wrapped it
around<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:48.010> little<00:02:48.100> bit<00:02:48.340> everything<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.600> nice

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
stick your fork in it and then you'll

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.819 
stick your fork in it and then you'll
know<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:36.700> done<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.060> it'll<00:03:37.209> get<00:03:37.480> nice<00:03:37.720> and
