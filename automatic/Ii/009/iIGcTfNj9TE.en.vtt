hey dudes we have new welcome to my lab
this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.620> Versailles<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.670> today<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.480> wanted<00:00:13.109> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this is Versailles and today I wanted to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.400 
this is Versailles and today I wanted to
talk<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.770> about<00:00:14.100> the<00:00:14.670> Millstone<00:00:15.410> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
talk to you about the Millstone the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.220 
talk to you about the Millstone the
Millstone<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.609> very<00:00:17.850> first

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
Millstone is actually the very first

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
Millstone is actually the very first
lucky<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.560> you'll<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.920> able<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.220> build<00:00:20.550> when

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
lucky that you'll be able to build when

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.290 
lucky that you'll be able to build when
you<00:00:21.090> start<00:00:21.450> a<00:00:21.570> new<00:00:21.720> world<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.520> various

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you start a new world in with various

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
you start a new world in with various
involved<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:26.000> well<00:00:27.000> let's<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.780> what<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
involved and well let's see what the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
involved and well let's see what the
thing<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.690> do<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.410> millstone<00:00:31.920> well

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
thing you can do with a millstone well

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.119 
thing you can do with a millstone well
the<00:00:33.210> very<00:00:33.539> first<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.739> with

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
the very first thing you have to do with

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
the very first thing you have to do with
it<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.600> em<00:00:37.470> fibers<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it will be to make em fibers you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760 
it will be to make em fibers you can
power<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.890> Millstone<00:00:41.840> runnin<00:00:42.840> crank<00:00:43.200> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
power the Millstone runnin crank just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240 
power the Millstone runnin crank just
like<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.600> as<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.720> can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> gear<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.649> being

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
like so as you can see the gear is being

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.750 
like so as you can see the gear is being
filled<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.059> you'll<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.469> four<00:00:49.950> F

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
filled so you'll need three or four F

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.780 
filled so you'll need three or four F
for<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:53.100> maybe<00:00:53.399> five<00:00:54.020> both<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.430> you'll<00:00:56.430> turn

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
for now maybe five both and you'll turn

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.260 
for now maybe five both and you'll turn
the<00:00:57.300> pump<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:58.410> em<00:00:58.559> fibers<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.969> M

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the pump into em fibers and with this M

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889 
the pump into em fibers and with this M
fibers<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> able<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.040> build<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.899> windmill

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
don't need to craft fabric first and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
don't need to craft fabric first and
which<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> windmill<00:01:08.369> you'll<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.940> able<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
borrow your millstone from either under

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.530 
borrow your millstone from either under
or<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.610> power<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
or top of it we can power it from the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.499 
or top of it we can power it from the
sides<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> won't<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.119> use

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
sides and this way you won't have to use

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.200 
sides and this way you won't have to use
the<00:01:36.869> N<00:01:37.080> trick<00:01:37.439> anymore<00:01:38.240> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.420> power<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
the N trick anymore when you power the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.649 
the N trick anymore when you power the
Millstone<00:01:42.210> through<00:01:42.930> axles<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> gearbox<00:01:44.659> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
Millstone through axles and gearbox you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.429 
Millstone through axles and gearbox you
can<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.590> automate<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.820> production<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> what

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can now automate the production of what

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
can now automate the production of what
have<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.759> best<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have you and the best way to do that is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.910 
have you and the best way to do that is
to<00:01:52.369> place<00:01:53.369> where<00:01:53.930> around<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.290> mill<00:01:55.530> stone

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to place where around the mill stone

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.990 
to place where around the mill stone
just<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:58.680> where<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> drops<00:01:59.310> will

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
just like so this where the drops will

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.109 
just like so this where the drops will
be<00:02:00.619> arrested<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.250> collect<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> we'll<00:02:03.750> go

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
be arrested and collect it and we'll go

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.929 
be arrested and collect it and we'll go
in<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.240> case<00:02:06.479> into<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.320> hopper<00:02:07.799> which<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
in this case into a hopper which is

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.839 
in this case into a hopper which is
right<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:11.039> we'll<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.549> in<00:02:11.579> another

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
right here that we'll see in another

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:19.420 
right here that we'll see in another
video<00:02:15.019> everybody<00:02:16.819> well<00:02:17.819> get<00:02:18.029> out

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
video everybody well get out

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
video everybody well get out
ready<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.920> also<00:02:23.330> use<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.540> Millstone<00:02:25.020> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
ready you can also use the Millstone to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
ready you can also use the Millstone to
make<00:02:26.060> floor<00:02:27.060> which<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.530> cooked<00:02:29.010> into

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
make floor which can then be cooked into

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.750 
make floor which can then be cooked into
doughnuts<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.959> cauldron<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.760> you'll

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
doughnuts in the cauldron and you'll

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.710 
doughnuts in the cauldron and you'll
also<00:02:32.970> need<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.390> Millstone<00:02:34.310> too<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
also need the Millstone too that's the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.910 
also need the Millstone too that's the
42<00:02:39.720> process<00:02:40.530> known<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.739> Iraq<00:02:42.380> into<00:02:43.380> ground<00:02:43.709> net

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.680 
42 process known as Iraq into ground net
Iraq<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.519> this<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.720> needed<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.319> make

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
Iraq and this will be needed to make

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.550 
Iraq and this will be needed to make
still<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:51.569> pretty<00:02:51.750> much<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.049> for<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
still and that's pretty much it for the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.150 
still and that's pretty much it for the
millstone<00:02:53.540> no<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.110> last<00:02:55.319> thing<00:02:55.530> when

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
millstone no just one last thing when

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.360 
millstone no just one last thing when
you're<00:02:56.340> making<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.480> an<00:02:57.810> automated<00:02:58.680> system<00:02:58.799> just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
you're making a an automated system just

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.190 
you're making a an automated system just
like<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.760> one<00:03:00.440> you'll<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.890> rate<00:03:02.280> raised

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
like this one you'll have to rate raised

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.559 
like this one you'll have to rate raised
the<00:03:04.200> walls<00:03:04.489> surrounding<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.910> suggest

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
the walls surrounding it I suggest

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.199 
the walls surrounding it I suggest
making<00:03:06.840> them<00:03:07.290> two<00:03:07.680> blocks<00:03:08.069> high<00:03:08.220> otherwise

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
making them two blocks high otherwise

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.280 
making them two blocks high otherwise
the<00:03:09.569> drops<00:03:09.989> might<00:03:10.530> end<00:03:11.130> up<00:03:11.540> under<00:03:12.540> funnels<00:03:13.080> I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the drops might end up under funnels I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.720 
the drops might end up under funnels I
used<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.099> watch<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.489> for

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
used here it's watch this for

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.039 
used here it's watch this for
demonstration<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:18.239> that's<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.900> hope

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
demonstration so now that's it I hope

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.250 
demonstration so now that's it I hope
you<00:03:19.410> learned<00:03:19.769> with<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.549> video<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.230> see<00:03:22.230> you
