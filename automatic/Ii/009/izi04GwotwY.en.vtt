00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:04.646
 Hello, everyone, I am Kevin. 

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:06.441
 Welcome everyone to watch Tech a Look 

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:10.951
 Today Kevin wants to teach you how to install the AMD series of CPUs! 

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.908
 That Kevin has taught you to install the Intel series of processors last time. 

00:00:14.908 --> 00:00:16.726
 Ok, then we can see today. 

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:18.764
 The motherboard we use today is 

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:22.867
 ASRock ASRock's FM2A75M-ITX motherboard! 

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:25.868
 The pin it supports is FM2 

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:26.934
 On the CPU side 

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.868
 We are using the AMD series of APU processors. 

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:33.975
 Model number is A8-5600K 

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:38.969
 Ok, then Kevin will teach you how to install this processor! 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.259
 Ok, now Kevin’s hand is the AMD APU processor. 

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.977
 So what is the APU processor? 

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:48.491
 Generally APU is CPU plus GPU 

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.756
 So it has the processing power of a general CPU 

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:56.122
 And plus it has the effect of displaying a wafer! 

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:00.303
 Ok, let's install our central processor now! 

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:02.508
 Ok, we can now see a white part in the center of the motherboard 

00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:06.642
 Is the pin FM2, a place to install the AMD series processor 

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:11.557
 First, let's pull the silver lever next to it first. 

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:15.311
 And this state is that we can install our CPU. 

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:20.031
 Ok, let's take care of our CPU. 

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:29.284
 Everyone pays special attention not to touch or damage the parts of the pins below. 

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:32.081
 Otherwise it may be affected if it is damaged. 

00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:36.791
 The normal working effect of your central processing unit 

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:40.926
 And usually have a foolproof effect when installing 

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:42.260
 Deteriorating design 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:51.564
 So when you install your CPU, you don't have to worry about it! 

00:01:51.564 --> 00:02:01.409
 Ok, let’s put the silver lever back in position after we put it in. 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.982
 Ok, then what we are using today is an original boxed product. 

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:12.473
 So it has an original fan and heat sink inside. 

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:17.314
 Ok, we can see that the thermal grease on the heat sink has been applied. 

00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:18.565
 Have it already 

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.402
 So if you use a heat sink with no thermal grease on it, 

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:26.267
 Please choose your own product 

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:32.673
 Ok, we can see that there are two tie rod holders on both sides. 

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.622
 Then I have to aim on both sides of our motherboard 

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.912
 There are two black holders 

00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:42.150
 Ok, let's install it now. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.819
 After the alignment, we can see the two sides of the heat sink 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.990
 There are two silver buckles 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.666
 Buckle on our black holder 

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:18.564
 Ok, now we have fixed 

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.260
 Then we have a handle on this side 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.635
 To fix it on our motherboard 

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.362
 Gently press down 

00:03:27.362 --> 00:03:30.068
 You can hear it when you hear a click! 

00:03:30.068 --> 00:03:34.646
 Finally, don't forget that there is a power cord on your CPU fan. 

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:38.136
 To be installed on our motherboard 

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.079
 Ok, so the installation is complete! 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.288
 The above is the teaching demonstration today. 

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:49.659
 Thank you for watching today. 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.022
