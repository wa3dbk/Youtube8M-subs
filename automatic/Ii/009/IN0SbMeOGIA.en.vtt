first close encounter of that moon

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
first close encounter of that moon
discovered<00:01:04.019> many<00:01:04.170> new<00:01:04.290> chemical<00:01:04.769> species<00:01:05.100> in

the atmosphere on a lot of these are

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
the atmosphere on a lot of these are
what<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.140> call<00:01:07.170> hydrocarbons<00:01:08.040> which<00:01:08.369> composed

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
what we call hydrocarbons which composed

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
what we call hydrocarbons which composed
of<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.210> types<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.570> atom<00:01:09.840> carbon<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.799> hydrogen

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
of two types of atom carbon and hydrogen

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
of two types of atom carbon and hydrogen
these<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.909> derived<00:01:12.180> from<00:01:12.540> methane<00:01:12.780> after<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
these are derived from methane after the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840 
these are derived from methane after the
methane<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> broken<00:01:14.040> apart<00:01:14.189> by<00:01:14.400> sunlight

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
methane is broken apart by sunlight

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
methane is broken apart by sunlight
forms<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.630> longer<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> longer<00:01:16.259> chain

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
forms into longer and longer chain

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
forms into longer and longer chain
molecules<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.670> add<00:01:17.759> first<00:01:18.000> two

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
molecules so you can add first two

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
molecules so you can add first two
carbons<00:01:19.020> together<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> family<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
carbons together to make a family of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.880 
carbons together to make a family of
molecules<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.840> also<00:01:21.960> form<00:01:22.439> three

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
molecules and you can also form three

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.160 
molecules and you can also form three
carbons<00:01:23.369> together<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.150> form<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.659> heavier

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
carbons together to form a heavier

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
carbons together to form a heavier
family<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> molecules<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.390> actually

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
family of molecules so it was actually

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
family of molecules so it was actually
very<00:01:27.659> mysterious<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.829> voyager<00:01:29.189> only

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
very mysterious the voyager only

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
very mysterious the voyager only
discovered<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.390> heaviest<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> lightest

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
discovered the heaviest and lightest

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
discovered the heaviest and lightest
members<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> three<00:01:32.040> carbon<00:01:32.130> family<00:01:32.850> but

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
members of the three carbon family but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
members of the three carbon family but
it<00:01:33.299> didn't<00:01:33.570> find<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> middle<00:01:34.079> member<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it didn't find the middle member of the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340 
it didn't find the middle member of the
family<00:01:34.790> propylene<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.479> missing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
family propylene that was missing

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.560 
family propylene that was missing
so<00:01:38.920> NASA<00:01:39.100> has<00:01:39.340> this<00:01:39.460> wonderful<00:01:39.700> flagship
