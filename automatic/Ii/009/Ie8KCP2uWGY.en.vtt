00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
there's that is that variant you can

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.940 
there's that is that variant you can
have<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:51.050> obviously<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.560> you've<00:03:51.650> got<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.770> lot

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
have the obviously so you've got a lot

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.440 
have the obviously so you've got a lot

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
slower so your patient shots and make

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.030 
slower so your patient shots and make
sure<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.630> actually<00:03:53.750> hit<00:03:53.990> them<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.680> couple<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
sure you actually hit them the couple of

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.949 
sure you actually hit them the couple of
games<00:03:55.160> i<00:03:55.340> did<00:03:55.520> use<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.970> couple<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.510> games<00:03:56.570> and

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
games i did use it a couple of games and

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.560 
games i did use it a couple of games and
it<00:03:57.320> seems<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.770> not<00:03:58.280> arc<00:03:58.550> as<00:03:58.760> much<00:03:58.970> as<00:03:59.240> some<00:03:59.420> of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
it seems to not arc as much as some of

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.199 
it seems to not arc as much as some of
them<00:03:59.690> do<00:03:59.810> it's<00:04:00.050> quite<00:04:00.410> faster<00:04:01.340> actually<00:04:01.850> like

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
them do it's quite faster actually like

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.030 
them do it's quite faster actually like
hitting<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.630> target<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.590> don't<00:04:03.770> have<00:04:03.860> to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
hitting the target so you don't have to

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.310 
hitting the target so you don't have to
so<00:04:04.670> line<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.480> know<00:04:05.570> exactly<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
so line it up and know exactly so the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.990 
so line it up and know exactly so the
angles<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.770> should<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.220> on<00:04:07.280> because<00:04:07.730> it

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
angles you should have it on because it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.820 
angles you should have it on because it
does<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.330> doesn't<00:04:08.480> upload<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.470> does<00:04:09.650> get

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
does it doesn't upload and it does get

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.940 
does it doesn't upload and it does get
