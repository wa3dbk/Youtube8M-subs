00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
of holes in his game too

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.779 
of holes in his game too
and<00:04:27.360> like<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.319> say<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> majority<00:04:29.069> of<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
and like I say the majority of it is the

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.659 
and like I say the majority of it is the
fact<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.090> he's<00:04:30.330> very<00:04:30.979> very<00:04:31.979> slow<00:04:32.370> footed

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
fact that he's very very slow footed

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.399 
fact that he's very very slow footed
these<00:04:32.970> days<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.620> his<00:04:34.620> punch<00:04:34.919> output<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:36.409> okay

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
these days and his punch output is okay

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.589 
these days and his punch output is okay
but<00:04:37.860> not<00:04:38.099> that<00:04:38.280> great<00:04:38.639> water<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.389> definitely

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
but not that great water is definitely

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.339 
but not that great water is definitely
the<00:04:39.960> athlete<00:04:40.319> in<00:04:40.409> the<00:04:40.500> -<00:04:40.680> he<00:04:40.889> has<00:04:41.009> faster<00:04:41.490> feet
