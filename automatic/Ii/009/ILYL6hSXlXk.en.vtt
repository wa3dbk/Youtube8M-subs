00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in this account is we're actually going

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.440 
in this account is we're actually going
to<00:00:45.450> use<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.870> larger<00:00:46.260> rock<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:47.270> on<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
to use some larger rock here on on the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.049 
edges taper to a finer rock in the
center<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> give<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> look<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.230> erosion

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
center to give it the look of erosion

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
center to give it the look of erosion
we'll<00:00:54.059> keep<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> progresses<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> then

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we'll keep it as it progresses and then

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
we'll keep it as it progresses and then
with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> water<00:00:56.370> flow<00:00:56.670> we're<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.030> going

steps in this area so a small portion of
this<00:02:05.060> back<00:02:05.330> here<00:02:05.600> about<00:02:06.590> two<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.890> half<00:02:06.920> feet

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
this back here about two and a half feet

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.590 
this back here about two and a half feet
is<00:02:07.280> going<00:02:07.429> to<00:02:07.490> be<00:02:07.550> exposed<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.239> we're<00:02:08.390> going<00:02:08.539> to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
is going to be exposed so we're going to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.359 
is going to be exposed so we're going to
kind<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.050> create<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.500> same<00:02:09.769> illusion<00:02:10.250> with

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
kind of create the same illusion with

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.750 
kind of create the same illusion with
the<00:02:10.489> rock<00:02:10.700> rolling<00:02:11.030> around<00:02:12.610> offset<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.730> with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the rock rolling around offset it with

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.640 
the rock rolling around offset it with
some<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.150> these<00:02:14.239> these<00:02:14.660> larger<00:02:15.080> smooth<00:02:15.380> River

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
some of these these larger smooth River

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.740 
some of these these larger smooth River
Rock<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.760> give<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:16.940> some<00:02:17.180> problems<00:02:17.630> on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
Rock just to give it some problems on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140 
Rock just to give it some problems on
the<00:02:18.080> key<00:02:18.260> corner<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.610> may<00:02:19.850> basically

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the key corner and this may basically

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.789 
the key corner and this may basically
have<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.840> look<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.170> it's<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> vein<00:02:21.769> of

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
have that look like it's the vein of

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.039 
have that look like it's the vein of
rock<00:02:22.130> disappearing<00:02:22.819> into<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.420> end<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
rock disappearing into the end of the

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.830 
rock disappearing into the end of the
steps<00:02:25.030> we're<00:02:26.030> going<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> do<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.360> same<00:02:26.569> thing

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
steps we're going to do the same thing

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.680 
steps we're going to do the same thing
over<00:02:26.989> here<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.440> other<00:02:27.470> side<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.690> damn

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
over here on the other side of this damn

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.670 
over here on the other side of this damn
wall<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.370> coming<00:02:32.269> off<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.480> we're<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.959> we're

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
wall and coming off the we're and we're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520 
wall and coming off the we're and we're
going<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.890> integrate<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.600> into<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.079> flatter

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
going to integrate that into a flatter

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.210 
going to integrate that into a flatter
moss<00:02:37.190> rock<00:02:37.519> tile<00:02:37.820> style<00:02:38.769> stepped<00:02:39.769> up<00:02:39.980> type

moss rock tile style stepped up type
water<00:02:40.519> feature<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.910> we're<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.269> to

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
water feature and we're going to

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.150 
water feature and we're going to
incorporate<00:02:41.810> some<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.079> this<00:02:42.260> river<00:02:42.500> rock<00:02:42.769> into

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
incorporate some of this river rock into

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.789 
incorporate some of this river rock into
it<00:02:43.280> as<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:44.090> change<00:02:44.359> from<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:44.750> rock<00:02:44.989> strata<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
it as we change from one rock strata to

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.810 
it as we change from one rock strata to
the<00:02:45.920> next<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.109> back<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.489> areas

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the next and then back in the areas

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.940 
the next and then back in the areas
where<00:02:49.970> we<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.359> Rays<00:02:50.540> beam<00:02:50.840> that'll<00:02:51.829> go

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
where we have the Rays beam that'll go

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.099 
where we have the Rays beam that'll go
to<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.100> more<00:02:52.400> linear<00:02:52.609> flatter<00:02:53.600> style<00:02:54.940> rock<00:02:56.109> work

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
to a more linear flatter style rock work

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.440 
to a more linear flatter style rock work
we're<00:02:57.350> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.500> use<00:02:57.680> primarily<00:02:58.250> large<00:02:59.060> slabs

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
we're going to use primarily large slabs

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.210 
we're going to use primarily large slabs
of<00:02:59.810> moss<00:03:00.470> rock<00:03:00.709> we're<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.100> incorporate

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
of moss rock we're going to incorporate

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.949 
of moss rock we're going to incorporate
some<00:03:01.670> river<00:03:01.850> rock<00:03:02.060> into<00:03:02.359> it<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.690> maintain

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
some river rock into it just to maintain

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.160 
some river rock into it just to maintain
some<00:03:03.350> continuity<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:05.570> those<00:03:05.840> are<00:03:05.989> going<00:03:06.109> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
some continuity and those are going to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.660 
some continuity and those are going to
finish<00:03:06.320> out<00:03:06.530> about<00:03:06.709> three<00:03:06.950> foot<00:03:07.130> tall<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
finish out about three foot tall and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.550 
finish out about three foot tall and
then<00:03:08.359> with<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.600> slide<00:03:08.870> there<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.320> center

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
then with the slide there in the center

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.030 
then with the slide there in the center
which<00:03:09.950> will<00:03:10.100> have<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> real<00:03:10.880> nice<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.209> recolor

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
which will have a real nice to recolor

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.460 
which will have a real nice to recolor
incandescent<00:03:13.120> blast<00:03:14.120> tile<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.720> any<00:03:15.350> other
