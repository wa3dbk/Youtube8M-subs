00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.000
 game can not climb it can not 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.220
 finish the walk through or the guide by 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.599
 copyright problems with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 cinematic so nothing comes back to 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.829
 ask forgiveness for that matter what is said 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.240
 location guide of weapons in 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.490
 golden chapter 1 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.410
 the first part the first part of 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.960
 alarm the weapon in this chapter is called 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.160
 pt 92 which is the main pistol of max 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.200
 payne 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.550
 the two pistols that only stop the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.920
 hand one as you want to call as 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.600
 you want to wear them well you will find 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.160
 after completing the first tutorial 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.809
 of the tutorial in which the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.890
 basic controls of the bulletin shoot 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.989
 etc 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.940
 after eliminating the first group of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.379
 enemies first to the first ones in 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.540
 start we're here behind this door 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.769
 we search on the ground just to the right 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.330
 from the door instead of putting them 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.680
 directly through that door we go a 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.210
 little is on the right we will find the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.390
 first part of the weapon 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 also the second part of the gun 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.530
 from max the pt 92 I repeat it will be after 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.729
 to see the sequence in which they released 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 the one that freed the hostages 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.590
 obviously when we do 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.420
 the jump is on camera in slow motion 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.580
 and we shoot if we want in the pool 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.230
 it will be just the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.500
 behind the circular desk 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.810
 we will find the weapon the piece of the weapon 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.390
 right between two columns right next 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.100
 of the window will be just to remind the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 right of the elevator between the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.690
 window and the writer the desk 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.790
 circular forgiveness and finally to the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.540

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.710
 green of the parking that you have to look for in 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.160
 a corner we will have the enemies 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.590
 opposite so once we finish with 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.120
 all enemies because we get to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590
 look for the weapon that is here to remember 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.440
 right in the corner we press the button 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 that is here behind you see it and we finish 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.990
 against the enemies when we want 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.520
 against the enemies we continue in straight 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.410
 towards the bottom and just to the right here 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.009
 remember in these columns with the number 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.590
 b of 0 5 0 4 and 0 2 and 0 3 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.000
 then there at the bottom of the whole corner 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.069
 will be the third part of the soul 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.209
 putting 22 so nothing I hope you 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.840
