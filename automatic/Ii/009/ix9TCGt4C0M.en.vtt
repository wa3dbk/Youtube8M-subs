 heavier but keep it much 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.560
 nicer than all the previous ones 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750

 paperwhite compared to 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.250
 predecessors are the screen 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.650
 backlight touch speed 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.790
 inch e-ink screen with pe-hd technology 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.320
 became a bit whiter and more contrast 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.510
 thanks to the backlight 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.390
 despite the hd in the title the screen has 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.640
 1024 by 768 resolution 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.680

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.110
 high resolution for young screens on 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.630
 the moment it is identical to the resolution

 iPad 2 or iPad Mini is much bigger 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.610

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
 the illumination at the bottom is practically not 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.720
 distracting because before her eyes 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.730
