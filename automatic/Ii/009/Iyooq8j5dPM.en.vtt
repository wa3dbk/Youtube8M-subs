follow-up to my last vlog on race and if
you<00:00:05.069> haven't<00:00:05.370> watched<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.640> already<00:00:06.060> please

you haven't watched that already please
watch<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.509> first<00:00:06.899> because<00:00:07.649> there<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
watch that first because there are a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.280 
watch that first because there are a
couple<00:00:08.460> things<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.090> feel<00:00:09.330> it's<00:00:09.540> best<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.960> clear

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
couple things I feel it's best to clear

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.860 
couple things I feel it's best to clear
up<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:11.400> instance<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.240> video<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.660> made

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
up for instance in that video I made

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.690 
up for instance in that video I made
statements<00:00:13.170> like<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.130> been<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.429> over

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
statements like this it's been like over

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.700 
statements like this it's been like over
50<00:00:15.210> years<00:00:15.299> since<00:00:15.570> scientists<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.350> stopped

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
50 years since scientists have stopped

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.320 
50 years since scientists have stopped
using<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.250> word<00:00:17.279> race<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> sense<00:00:18.270> that

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
using the word race in the sense that

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390 
using the word race in the sense that
you're<00:00:18.600> using<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> right<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.470> science

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you're using it right now science

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.849 
you're using it right now science
rejects<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> idea<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> race<00:00:21.869> as<00:00:22.230> defined<00:00:22.710> in

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
rejects the idea of race as defined in

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.859 
rejects the idea of race as defined in
popular<00:00:23.279> culture<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.720> have

observed quite a few people and they
received<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> comments<00:00:27.180> saying<00:00:27.599> stuff

like this folks race is a real

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
like this folks race is a real
biological<00:00:30.590> taxonomic<00:00:31.590> term<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.250> isn't<00:00:32.669> done

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

biological taxonomic term it isn't done
explain<00:00:33.180> why<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.480> medicine<00:00:33.780> works<00:00:33.960> better

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
explain why some medicine works better

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.930 
explain why some medicine works better
than<00:00:34.260> whites<00:00:34.500> some<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.100> regions<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> some

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
than whites some better regions and some

than whites some better regions and some
better<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.239> blacks<00:00:36.450> please<00:00:37.140> explain<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.649> a

better on blacks please explain why a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
better on blacks please explain why a
DNA<00:00:38.010> test<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.430> determine<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.940> percentage

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
DNA test can determine what percentage

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
DNA test can determine what percentage
of<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.600> races<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of all races you are if we are all the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.369 
of all races you are if we are all the
same<00:00:41.370> by<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.570> no<00:00:42.750> idea<00:00:43.050> where<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
same by the way I have no idea where you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
same by the way I have no idea where you
people<00:00:43.530> got<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.280> never<00:00:44.550> claimed<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
people got this I never claimed that we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
people got this I never claimed that we
are<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.710> thing<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.129> are

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
are all the same actually thing we are

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
are all the same actually thing we are
very<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.940> different<00:00:48.239> especially<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.079> an

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
very very different especially on an

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.029 
very very different especially on an
individual<00:00:49.710> level

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

please<00:00:50.520> start<00:00:50.789> reading<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> research<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
please start reading the research and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
please start reading the research and
stop<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.170> dramatic<00:00:52.590> political<00:00:52.739> correctness

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
stop your dramatic political correctness

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.729 
stop your dramatic political correctness
yeah<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> me<00:00:55.500> being

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
yeah about this thing of me being

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.930 
yeah about this thing of me being
politically<00:00:56.399> correct

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
politically correct

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.290 
politically correct
just<00:00:57.239> watch<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.780> other<00:00:57.809> videos<00:00:58.350> hmm<00:00:59.300> okay

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
just watch my other videos hmm okay

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
just watch my other videos hmm okay
let's<00:01:00.480> take<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.719> bi<00:01:01.020> points<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.309> all

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
let's take this bi points first of all

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
let's take this bi points first of all
can<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> DNA<00:01:03.329> test<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:04.409> determine<00:01:05.070> your

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
can a DNA test really determine your

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210 
can a DNA test really determine your
race<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.110> simple<00:01:07.590> way<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> answer

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
race and a very simple way to answer

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.600 
race and a very simple way to answer
this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.760> no<00:01:09.470> DNA<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> fact<00:01:11.100> determine

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
this is no DNA can in fact determine

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
this is no DNA can in fact determine
from<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:12.030> continent<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.869> ancestors<00:01:13.470> came

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
from which continent your ancestors came

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.999 
from which continent your ancestors came
from<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.549> fraction<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.450> came<00:01:15.750> from

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
from what fraction of them came from

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
from what fraction of them came from
Africa<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.280> Europe<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:18.180> where<00:01:18.420> Native

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
Africa from Europe or where Native

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
Africa from Europe or where Native
Americans<00:01:19.259> however<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> quite

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
Americans however this is quite

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
Americans however this is quite
different<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.689> telling<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.530> race<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.400> are

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
different from telling what race you are

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.780 
different from telling what race you are
take<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.990> instance<00:01:25.310> Hispanics<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.549> have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
take for instance Hispanics they have

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
take for instance Hispanics they have
Amerindian<00:01:27.630> European<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> African<00:01:28.829> ancestry

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Amerindian European and African ancestry

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
Amerindian European and African ancestry
and<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.150> basically<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> any

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and they can basically be of any

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
and they can basically be of any
so-called<00:01:32.070> race<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.970> include<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.360> link<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so-called race I will include a link in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
so-called race I will include a link in
the<00:01:33.750> description<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> one-hour<00:01:34.860> lecture

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the description it's a one-hour lecture

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.730 
the description it's a one-hour lecture
on<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.700> DNA<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.390> tell<00:01:36.540> us<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.869> race<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
on what DNA can tell us about race and I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.230 
on what DNA can tell us about race and I
think<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.400> clear<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
think it will clear up a lot of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149
