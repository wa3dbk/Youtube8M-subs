deceleration<00:01:22.439> after<00:01:23.220> its<00:01:23.400> fiery<00:01:24.680> you'll<00:01:25.680> see

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
deceleration after its fiery you'll see

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
deceleration after its fiery you'll see
multiple<00:01:26.280> plots<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> screen<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.720> darker

one being the more current and the as
time<00:01:31.439> progresses<00:01:31.920> you'll<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.570> becomes<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
time progresses you'll see it becomes a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.090 

now<00:01:44.550> what<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.790> should<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.690> trend<00:01:46.170> after

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
now what we should see is a trend after

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
now what we should see is a trend after
the<00:01:47.250> firing<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.880> cylinder<00:01:48.330> five<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the firing of cylinder five that the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.650 
the firing of cylinder five that the
crank<00:01:49.380> itself<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.920> begin<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.220> decelerate

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.110 

now<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.720> technician<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:56.460> determine<00:01:56.880> very

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
now the technician can determine very

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.840 
now the technician can determine very
quickly<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:58.440> cylinder<00:01:58.740> five<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.580> source

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
quickly the cylinder five is the source

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.180 
quickly the cylinder five is the source
of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.120> misfire<00:02:00.480> in<00:02:00.510> this<00:02:00.840> case<00:02:03.830> as<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.040> can

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
of the misfire in this case as you can

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
of the misfire in this case as you can
see<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> trend<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.470> very<00:02:07.470> steady<00:02:08.810> cylinder

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
see the trend is very steady cylinder

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.680 
see the trend is very steady cylinder
