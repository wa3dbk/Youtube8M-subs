00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.380
 all friends today with you again I 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.029
 Vladimir and today tell you about 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.550
 how to call your computer 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.950
 via android smartphones to friends 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.239
 colleagues close in general your contact 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.640
 do something very simple 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.280
 1 that you need to install it 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.699
 airdroid is available on google 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.260
 play 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.320
 completely free can 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.570
 scan the qr-code or download it by 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.269
 link that will be in the description under this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.129
 video and so the program we see 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.409
 Russified we go into the settings 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.420
 what's the first thing we care about 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.010
 this version of airdroid 2 that is, if anyone 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 that thinks I had a review from and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.180
 the program is completely right only 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.010
 now the program has grown to the second 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.760
 versions and the third version allows you to do 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 calls 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 removed and so it is necessary to disable the mode 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.080
 power saving put it in 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.990
 parameter 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.970
 of because even if you bet 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.950
 phone on charging you run this 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.350
 program then after 10 minutes you have 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.210
 connection breakdown occurs if you 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.040
 this option turn on mode 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.850
 energy saving then you will have access to 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.210
 your phone 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.149
 all is not a week for 24 hours without 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 any problems and we need to drive this 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.560
 ip address in any browser 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 let it be chrome browser 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.539
 no problem at all if you have 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.060
 routes tomorrow I let you 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.710
 I recommend to make static shots 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.539
 I have a phone like that always with 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.749
 addresses stadium 128 17 i just did in 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.759
 static through the router and true 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.499
 the phone connects to the wi-fi network then 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 there is he always with that address and 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.749
 getting i can always run 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.229
 program and in any places connect to 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.490
 I don't even have to have my phone 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.979
 look at the phone screen to know 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.960
 what is the address and so we confirmed 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.960
 mate we see that now we have 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.380
 The phone is connected to a computer or 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.810
 vice versa 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.780
 and that I want to show you on 100 as we 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.950
 turned off power saving mode 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 our program even works with 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 screen off i.e. this service 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.910
 which always works 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.459
 these are all the messages 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.950
 applications image files and I'm talking about everything 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.370
 it is already told that is basically 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.920
 Here are the house of these utilities in the second 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.290
 versions did not increase they remained in that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.270
 same amount therefore i recommend you 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.650
 see my past review of this 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.959
 program link will also be in the description 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.150
 to the video there I am telling everything in detail 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.280
 what can be done on this program 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.019
 in fact, you can do a lot 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.300
 there is even the fact that you can listen 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.340
 music from your phone and watch movies without 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.680
 any brakes it's cool but us 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.970
 worries exactly the call and here are the calls 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.610
 appeared only in the second version 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.950
 let's show you the headset now 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.650
 connected that is basically hanging too 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.739
 bluetooth connection usual indicator 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.380
 headset 1200 rubles that is budget 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.360
 but here in principle from the headset nothing 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.930
 depends it will work with any 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.260
 headsets 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.610
 The main thing is that your phone worked with it and 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.010
 let's call any reference 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.590
 the service that is, we will not pull my 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.320
 friends and talk to the robot 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.450
 answering machine and now let it be 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.190
 microsoft that is, but the first is just 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.620
 Got there is also the body but let on 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.540
 red turn off the screen that is here it is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.480
 docking stations in the bedroom and I generally 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.540
 I don’t know office I don’t see my 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.760
 phone i want to call microsoft let 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.160
 it can be a challenge to put right the way 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.130
 the message itself is a necessary call and see 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.380
 what happens on the phone screen right away 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.530
 There is a bluetooth speaker connection 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.200
 There are now Turks in the horn, all I am now 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.870
 I hear yes, I now hear the conversation 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.620
 there is but i will hang up i can put 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.920
 through the headset 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.890
 either through the principle of this program if 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.690
 your friend has a photo if you 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.800
 snap a photo of the account 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.140
 the kind of place will be his photos 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480
 that is, the principle is very cool something 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.769
 say why invent a bicycle 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.770
 bike reinvent it for you for real 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.020
 I do n’t even consider it a bicycle 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.210
 when the phone is in the bedroom next door 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.160
 with a bed on the nightstand and I don't want 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.290
 go down with him everywhere at home that is 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.970
 Russian he lies there I can always 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.760
 call those over 50 percent of your 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 free time for the house I spend for 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.290
 by computer 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 that's basically very cool convenient 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.240
 here is such a life hack put a finger 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.890
 up if you like do not put 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.230
 thumb down if you don't like 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.720
 just maybe in the future you 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.320
 I saw it too long to be useful for everyone 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.240
 see you soon 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.800
