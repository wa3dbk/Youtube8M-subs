adjustment screws is both you can see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
adjustment screws is both you can see
that<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.369> great<00:01:22.159> its<00:01:23.159> marked<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that is pretty great its marked on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
that is pretty great its marked on the
side<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:25.369> laser<00:01:26.369> only<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
side for laser only and there is the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.080 
side for laser only and there is the
laser<00:01:31.040> over<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.640> light<00:01:33.509> only<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
laser over here we have light only so we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.170 
laser over here we have light only so we
have<00:01:36.240> light<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.790> several

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
have light now I got this for several

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.179 
have light now I got this for several
reasons<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.560> being<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> surefire<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.960> two

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
reasons one it being a surefire and two

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.289 
reasons one it being a surefire and two
you<00:01:44.189> ever<00:01:44.369> try<00:01:44.579> shooting<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.149> with

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you ever try shooting and going with

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.889 
you ever try shooting and going with
this<00:01:45.390> thing<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:47.149> switch<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.689> one

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
this thing on it I switch on this one

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.310 
this thing on it I switch on this one
broke<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> don't<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> switch<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.880> here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
broke so I don't have a switch back here

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.859 
broke so I don't have a switch back here
so<00:01:52.320> I've<00:01:52.619> had<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.189> jerry-rig<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> make<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.780 

crappy<00:01:57.869> switch<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:01.250> if<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.280> ever<00:02:02.490> tried

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
crappy switch and if you ever tried

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
crappy switch and if you ever tried
firing<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> gun<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.130> with<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> jammed<00:02:05.579> up

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
firing a gun like this with a jammed up

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020 
firing a gun like this with a jammed up
in<00:02:06.090> between<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> frame<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.940> will

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
in between it and the frame you will

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.199 
in between it and the frame you will
find<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.780> pops<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
find that it pops out so then if you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.190 
find that it pops out so then if you
need<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
need it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.589 
need it
you<00:02:13.560> can't<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.879> unless<00:02:15.000> you're<00:02:15.239> using<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
you can't use it unless you're using a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.190 
you can't use it unless you're using a
two-hand<00:02:15.989> operation<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.660> small<00:02:18.870> slot<00:02:19.019> to
