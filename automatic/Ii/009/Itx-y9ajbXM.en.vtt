micro series of helicopters this is a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.950 
micro series of helicopters this is a
stout<00:00:43.680> CX<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> perfect<00:00:45.570> introduction

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
stout CX this is a perfect introduction

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.010 
stout CX this is a perfect introduction
to<00:00:46.170> RC<00:00:46.559> helicopters<00:00:47.329> flies<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> same

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
to RC helicopters flies in much the same

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.590 
to RC helicopters flies in much the same
way<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> larger<00:00:50.309> helicopter<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
way as a larger helicopter would but

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
way as a larger helicopter would but
it's<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:51.870> two<00:00:52.050> sets<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> rotor<00:00:52.530> blades<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's got two sets of rotor blades and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's got two sets of rotor blades and
otero<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> blade<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.180> call<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> coaxial

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
otero to blade they call this a coaxial

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
otero to blade they call this a coaxial
helicopter<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:56.160> makes<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> inherently<00:00:56.760> stable

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
helicopter it makes it inherently stable

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
helicopter it makes it inherently stable
and<00:00:58.140> therefore<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:58.980> for

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and therefore it's really good for

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
and therefore it's really good for
learning<00:00:59.480> obviously<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.750> its<00:01:00.960> small

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
learning obviously because of its small

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
learning obviously because of its small
size<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.890> fly<00:01:02.070> inside<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.539> not

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
size you can fly inside it's not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.719 
size you can fly inside it's not
dangerous<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:05.070> has<00:01:06.979> plenty<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.490> when

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
dangerous and it has plenty of time when

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:31.320 
dangerous and it has plenty of time when
you're<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.090> learning
