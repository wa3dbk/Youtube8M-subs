what's you going to do what's Jackson I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.789 
what's you going to do what's Jackson I
think<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.070> she<00:01:08.369> learns<00:01:09.360> how<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> interact

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
think that she learns how to interact

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
think that she learns how to interact
with<00:01:10.950> other<00:01:11.189> people<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.820> especially<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
with other people and especially me I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
with other people and especially me I
think<00:01:13.290> she<00:01:13.680> learns<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> become<00:01:14.460> vocal

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
think she learns how to become vocal

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.960 
think she learns how to become vocal
like<00:01:15.420> she<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.750> right<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:17.580> she

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
like she is right now and I think she

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.960 
like she is right now and I think she
learns<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.630> facial<00:01:19.020> expressions<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.100> she

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
learns the facial expressions and she

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
learns the facial expressions and she
reacts<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> my<00:01:21.509> expressions<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.439> I've

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
reacts to my expressions which I've

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.830

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
stage one it's a little bit more busy

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.390 
stage one it's a little bit more busy
it's<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.350> little<00:02:03.530> bit<00:02:03.620> more<00:02:03.740> frantic<00:02:03.980> and<00:02:04.340> at

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
it's a little bit more frantic and at

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.790 
it's a little bit more frantic and at
first<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.940> quite<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> change<00:02:05.570> but<00:02:06.410> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
first it's quite a change but the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.650 
first it's quite a change but the
children<00:02:07.670> really<00:02:07.850> love<00:02:08.030> watching<00:02:08.390> each<00:02:08.479> other

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.940 
so I think they learn quite a lot from
watching<00:02:10.340> each<00:02:10.610> other<00:02:10.850> saying<00:02:11.450> hello<00:02:12.350> to
