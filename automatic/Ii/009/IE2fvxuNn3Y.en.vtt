00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 today we are going to learn to kick the ball 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:28.570
 with the inside of the foot then it's not 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:35.800
 for the outside 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.510
 inside rule number one when one 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 is going to make the ball with the inside of the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.039
 standing is that this kickstand feels is 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.579
 you will need the same height as the 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.579
 ball 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.519
 straight 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 then the foot with which you do not kick 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.150
 It has to be here in the step of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.150
 The ball looks like everyone 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.979
 and took off 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.940
 of this 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.359
 to see now 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.740
 and we are going to do so let's move 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 for all the space of the cones and we're going 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.890
 to kick the ball with the inside of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.890
 foot 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.530
 that but I looked at the foot next to the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:15.190
 ball to the side and then I follow him to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.190
 the ball 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 the scorratel of the ball 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.230
 the practice 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 do not 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.500
 when they did 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.270
 do not 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.510
 i 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 two 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 but 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.170
 home
