00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
projectile damage modifiers I have a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.770 
projectile damage modifiers I have a
feeling<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.980> gun<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:39.000> lot<00:02:39.750> better

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
feeling this gun would be a lot better

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.530 
feeling this gun would be a lot better
if<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:41.040> wasn't<00:02:41.459> actually<00:02:41.610> broken<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.510> now

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
if it wasn't actually broken right now

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.860 
if it wasn't actually broken right now
however<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.800> still<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.670> pretty<00:02:45.150> decent

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
however it's still a pretty decent

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.080 
however it's still a pretty decent
shotgun<00:02:46.410> you're<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.130> gonna<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.940> up

quick<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.930> said<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.650> don't

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
quick so with all that said I don't

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160 
quick so with all that said I don't
think<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.610> fair<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> call<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.569> weapon<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
think it's fair to call this weapon a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.229 
think it's fair to call this weapon a
terrible<00:03:04.680> weapon<00:03:04.799> since<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.700> can't<00:03:05.970> actually

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
terrible weapon since we can't actually

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.050 
terrible weapon since we can't actually
