so<00:00:01.170> i<00:00:01.199> got<00:00:01.410> my<00:00:01.439> case<00:00:02.070> SCS<00:00:02.870> 1943<00:00:03.870> model<00:00:04.259> here<00:00:04.529> and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
so i got my case SCS 1943 model here and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.169 
so i got my case SCS 1943 model here and
i<00:00:04.740> did<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.400> recent<00:00:06.710> conversion<00:00:07.710> from<00:00:07.980> six<00:00:08.790> volts

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
i did a recent conversion from six volts

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.440 
i did a recent conversion from six volts
to<00:00:09.330> 12<00:00:09.599> volts<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.940> it's<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.059> simple

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
to 12 volts and the it's really simple

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.030 
to 12 volts and the it's really simple
the<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:12.929> thing<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> start<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.889> by

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the first thing to start with is by

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.519 
the first thing to start with is by
putting<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.460> new<00:00:14.610> alternator<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.360> take<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
putting a new alternator on take out the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.490 
putting a new alternator on take out the
old<00:00:16.590> generator<00:00:17.180> just<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.810> wire<00:00:19.080> job

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
old generator just get a one wire job

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.140 
old generator just get a one wire job
looks<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> lot<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> back<00:00:20.880> your

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
looks a lot like this on the back your

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
looks a lot like this on the back your
one<00:00:21.300> wire<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.800> right<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
one wire and this is not right here is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
one wire and this is not right here is
just<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> ground<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> don't<00:00:24.570> need<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
just a ground but you don't need that is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.429 
just a ground but you don't need that is
make<00:00:25.800> sure<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.150> me<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
make sure that you don't do like me and

you can put the balance resistor which

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
you can put the balance resistor which
is<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.260> an<00:01:04.439> eight<00:01:04.589> dollar<00:01:04.799> item<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.460> not

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
is just an eight dollar item it's not

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.480 
is just an eight dollar item it's not
very<00:01:05.790> much<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.740> does<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.220> drops

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
very much but what that does is it drops

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
six volts in this water so then that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.940 
six volts in this water so then that
gives<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.810> six<00:01:16.020> volts<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> six<00:01:16.740> volt

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
finding a new starter that will fit as
well<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.829> that's<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> slim<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
well as the one that's on it is slim to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
well as the one that's on it is slim to
none<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.990> better<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.380> keep<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
none so it's better to keep the one that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.080 
none so it's better to keep the one that
you<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you have because you know it's going to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.609 
you have because you know it's going to
fit<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> tractor<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:59.280> basically<00:01:59.729> it

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
fit the tractor and that's basically it

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.600 
fit the tractor and that's basically it
that's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> only<00:02:01.979> things<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.490> need

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that's the only things you really need

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.719 
that's the only things you really need
to<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:04.049> change<00:02:04.439> over<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.920> left<00:02:05.100> racal<00:02:05.369> system

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to to change over your left racal system

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459 
to to change over your left racal system
on<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> negative<00:02:06.149> ground<00:02:06.540> tractor<00:02:07.049> enough<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
on a negative ground tractor enough it's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.869 
on a negative ground tractor enough it's
a<00:02:07.530> positive<00:02:07.740> ground<00:02:08.129> tractor<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.729> all

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
a positive ground tractor it's all

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
a positive ground tractor it's all
complicated<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.690> i'm<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.899> even<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.349> go

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
complicated and i'm not even going to go

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
complicated and i'm not even going to go
there

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
there

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.390 
there
so<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.320> see<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.740> really<00:02:13.890> simple

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so as you can see it's really simple

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.600 
so as you can see it's really simple
once<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.630> 12-volt<00:02:16.470> system<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:22.610> as

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
once you get your 12-volt system just as

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.510 
once you get your 12-volt system just as
the<00:02:23.850> Pirates<00:02:24.240> rather
