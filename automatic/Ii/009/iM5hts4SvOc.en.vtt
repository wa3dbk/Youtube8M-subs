00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
resample bunny called fight I know he

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.170 
resample bunny called fight I know he
got<00:00:41.170> hurt<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.649> few<00:00:42.100> times<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.489> lot<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.730> times<00:00:42.970> in

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
got hurt a few times a lot of times in

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.790 
got hurt a few times a lot of times in
that<00:00:43.300> fight<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.690> he<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:44.140> can<00:00:44.290> argue<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.710> he

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
that fight and he you can argue that he

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.770 
that fight and he you can argue that he
went<00:00:44.950> down<00:00:45.190> twice<00:00:45.670> basically<00:00:46.360> in<00:00:46.420> that<00:00:46.570> fight

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
went down twice basically in that fight

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.500 
went down twice basically in that fight
but<00:00:46.989> he<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:48.010> think<00:00:48.489> he<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.730> take<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> punch<00:00:49.180> man<00:00:49.480> i

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
but he I think he can take a punch man i

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.049 
but he I think he can take a punch man i
think<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:50.320> patio<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:51.219> provodnikov<00:00:51.610> they

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
think that patio and provodnikov they

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.389 
think that patio and provodnikov they
punched<00:00:52.570> differently<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.320> providing<00:00:53.950> hope<00:00:54.219> he

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
punched differently a providing hope he

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.389 
punched differently a providing hope he
usually<00:00:54.610> throws<00:00:55.149> hooks<00:00:55.510> Pacquiao<00:00:56.469> he<00:00:57.129> usually

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
usually throws hooks Pacquiao he usually

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.720 
usually throws hooks Pacquiao he usually
throws<00:00:57.850> straits<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:59.250> I<00:01:00.250> think<00:01:02.430> Bradley<00:01:03.430> can

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
throws straits and I think Bradley can

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.450 
throws straits and I think Bradley can
handle<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.479> Straits<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.080> paki<00:01:05.770> away<00:01:06.250> much

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
handle the Straits of paki away much

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.029 
handle the Straits of paki away much
more<00:01:06.759> than<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.270> hooks<00:01:07.899> of<00:01:08.170> provodnikov<00:01:08.800> this

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
more than the hooks of provodnikov this

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.499 
more than the hooks of provodnikov this
is<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> way<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.460> see<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.759> but<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.060> mean<00:01:10.300> just

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
is the way I see it but I mean just

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.480 
is the way I see it but I mean just
judging<00:01:10.780> from<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.560> first<00:01:11.830> fight<00:01:12.069> of<00:01:12.100> pacquiao

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
judging from the first fight of pacquiao

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.510 
judging from the first fight of pacquiao
and<00:01:12.940> Bradley<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.720> provodnikov<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
and Bradley and the provodnikov and the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.820 
and Bradley and the provodnikov and the
Bradley<00:01:15.850> fight<00:01:16.000> but<00:01:16.319> talking<00:01:17.319> about<00:01:17.530> Pacquiao

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
Bradley fight but talking about Pacquiao

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.370 
Bradley fight but talking about Pacquiao
and<00:01:18.039> Bradley<00:01:18.369> though<00:01:18.660> that<00:01:19.660> spokeo<00:01:19.929> has<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.540 
Pacquio does knockout or or even knock
down<00:02:01.739> committee<00:02:02.739> Bradley<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.310> would<00:02:03.429> be

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
down committee Bradley that would be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.779 
down committee Bradley that would be
huge<00:02:04.060> man<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.450> i<00:02:04.750> think<00:02:05.020> i<00:02:05.259> would<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.250> shocked<00:02:06.550> i

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789

out<00:02:08.770> Timothy<00:02:09.160> Bradley<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.759> think<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.479> would

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
out Timothy Bradley I think that would

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.260 
out Timothy Bradley I think that would
be<00:02:11.040> they'll<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.130> crazy<00:02:12.459> if<00:02:12.760> he<00:02:12.790> knocks<00:02:13.090> out

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
be they'll be crazy if he knocks out

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.539 
be they'll be crazy if he knocks out
Timothy<00:02:13.629> Bradley<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:14.439> punch<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:15.069> mean

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
Timothy Bradley with one punch I mean

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.429 
Timothy Bradley with one punch I mean
when<00:02:15.939> was<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.209> last<00:02:16.360> time<00:02:16.540> Paquiao<00:02:17.049> actually

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
don't think he really helps the power to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.050 
don't think he really helps the power to
knock<00:02:56.959> out<00:02:57.140> anyone<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.830> be<00:02:57.950> honest<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.459> mean
