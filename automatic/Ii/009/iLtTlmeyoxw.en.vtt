00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
few minutes to load if you do purchase

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.100 
few minutes to load if you do purchase
this<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.850> start<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.540> hey<00:01:30.840> wait<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
this and start it and be like hey wait a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
this and start it and be like hey wait a
second<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:32.159> does<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> couple<00:01:32.909> seconds

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
second it does take a couple seconds

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719

slow<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.479> eat<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> good<00:01:34.200> computer<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.340> i

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
slow to eat on a good computer so i

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
slow to eat on a good computer so i
guess<00:01:36.570> let's<00:01:36.810> try<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.079> left<00:01:37.380> 4<00:01:37.530> dead<00:01:37.560> 2<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
guess let's try for left 4 dead 2 and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
guess let's try for left 4 dead 2 and
see<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.030> record<00:01:39.150> i've

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
see if we can get this to record i've

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
see if we can get this to record i've
changed<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.170> hotkeys<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> doesn't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
changed the hotkeys because it doesn't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.569 
changed the hotkeys because it doesn't
seem<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> wanted<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> read<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:43.549> f10<00:01:44.549> and
