00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
a nice easy collector base which means

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.420 
a nice easy collector base which means
it<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.300> dead<00:02:11.569> base<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.190> loot

it is a dead base and all of the loot
are<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.240> mines<00:02:14.510> and

are in the mines and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.130 
are in the mines and
course<00:02:15.530> pumps<00:02:16.340> however<00:02:16.969> this<00:02:17.269> guy<00:02:17.480> does<00:02:17.870> have

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
course pumps however this guy does have

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.780 
course pumps however this guy does have
the<00:02:18.260> mines<00:02:18.469> and<00:02:18.650> pumps<00:02:18.950> behind<00:02:19.340> his<00:02:19.519> walls

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
the mines and pumps behind his walls

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.949 
the mines and pumps behind his walls
which<00:02:20.060> does<00:02:20.299> make<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.659> little<00:02:20.719> more

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
which does make it a little more

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.809 
which does make it a little more
difficult<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.409> get<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.829> so<00:02:22.310> let's<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:22.609> we<00:02:22.730> get

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
difficult to get to so let's see we get

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.250 
difficult to get to so let's see we get
the<00:02:22.939> rest<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.359> do<00:02:23.480> have<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.659> decent<00:02:24.079> amount<00:02:24.109> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the rest we do have a decent amount of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.410 
the rest we do have a decent amount of
troops<00:02:24.469> left<00:02:24.799> I<00:02:25.040> may<00:02:25.639> have<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.879> use<00:02:25.909> my<00:02:26.120> kingdom

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
troops left I may have to use my kingdom

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.379 
troops left I may have to use my kingdom
in<00:02:26.629> order<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.310> my<00:02:28.310> main<00:02:28.579> worry<00:02:28.939> is<00:02:29.060> that

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
in order to get it my main worry is that

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.050 
in order to get it my main worry is that
dark<00:02:29.659> elixir<00:02:29.900> drill<00:02:30.319> up<00:02:30.499> on<00:02:30.709> top<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.879> I<00:02:32.000> do

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
dark elixir drill up on top and if I do

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.610 
dark elixir drill up on top and if I do
go<00:02:32.359> for<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.719> I<00:02:32.750> will<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:33.109> to<00:02:33.260> waste<00:02:33.439> a<00:02:33.590> lot

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.449 
my part now I am gonna worry about those
double<00:03:00.260> gold<00:03:00.439> mines<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:00.949> right<00:03:01.159> there<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
double gold mines on the right there and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.449 
double gold mines on the right there and
of<00:03:01.699> course<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:02.329> gold<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.169> elixir<00:03:03.260> pump<00:03:03.739> down

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
of course the gold and elixir pump down

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.159 
of course the gold and elixir pump down
there<00:03:04.669> on<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.849> left<00:03:04.909> so<00:03:05.449> this<00:03:05.659> segment<00:03:05.870> down

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
there on the left so this segment down

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.750 
there on the left so this segment down
here<00:03:06.439> is<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:06.799> important<00:03:07.310> because<00:03:07.430> there<00:03:07.730> is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
here is very important because there is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.189 
here is very important because there is
a<00:03:07.879> lot<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.299> loot<00:03:08.449> here<00:03:08.629> so<00:03:08.810> we're<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:08.989> drop<00:03:09.109> the

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.199 
a lot of loot here so we're and drop the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.140 
a lot of loot here so we're and drop the
King<00:03:09.379> down<00:03:09.760> since<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:10.879> don't<00:03:10.969> have<00:03:11.060> any

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
King down since we don't have any

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.970 
King down since we don't have any
lightning<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.750> drop<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.469> King<00:03:12.709> we'll<00:03:12.829> take

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
lightning to drop the King we'll take

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.369 
lightning to drop the King we'll take
the<00:03:13.099> hits<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.760> wizard<00:03:14.449> tower<00:03:14.480> now<00:03:15.199> we'll

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
the hits of that wizard tower now we'll

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.869 
the hits of that wizard tower now we'll
wall<00:03:15.590> break<00:03:15.799> into<00:03:16.010> both<00:03:16.159> sections<00:03:16.609> with<00:03:16.760> some

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
wall break into both sections with some

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.789 
wall break into both sections with some
wall<00:03:17.060> breakers<00:03:17.449> and<00:03:17.709> hopefully<00:03:18.709> these

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
wall breakers and hopefully these

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.740 
wall breakers and hopefully these
goblins<00:03:19.250> will<00:03:19.669> be<00:03:19.819> able<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.209> take<00:03:20.389> out<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
goblins will be able to take out the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.719 
goblins will be able to take out the
loot<00:03:20.959> while<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.859> King<00:03:22.129> distracts<00:03:22.639> the

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
loot while the King distracts the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.759 
loot while the King distracts the
defences<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.359> maybe<00:03:23.540> we'll<00:03:23.659> get<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.780> 50%<00:03:24.109> -<00:03:24.620> if

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
defences and maybe we'll get a 50% - if

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.360 
defences and maybe we'll get a 50% - if
we<00:03:24.859> get<00:03:24.979> lucky

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
we get lucky

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.999 
we get lucky
