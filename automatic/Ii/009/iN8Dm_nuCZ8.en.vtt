performance level that they were asking

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
performance level that they were asking
for<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.119> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for but that's something I'm just going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.490 
for but that's something I'm just going
to<00:01:45.270> keep<00:01:45.390> working<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.470> to
