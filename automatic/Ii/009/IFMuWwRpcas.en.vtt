moisture<00:00:16.030> retention<00:00:16.330> series<00:00:17.320> it's<00:00:17.530> basically

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
moisture retention series it's basically

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.840 
moisture retention series it's basically
moisture<00:00:18.660> 101<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:20.110> will<00:00:21.040> have<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.490> series<00:00:21.730> of

moisture 101 I will have a series of

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.090 
moisture 101 I will have a series of
videos<00:00:22.270> coming<00:00:22.690> after<00:00:22.960> this<00:00:23.110> one<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.950> will

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
to talk about the benefits of moisture

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.180 
to talk about the benefits of moisture
retention<00:00:34.719> before<00:00:35.289> I<00:00:35.350> get<00:00:35.469> started<00:00:35.530> let<00:00:36.070> me

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
retention before I get started let me

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.410 
retention before I get started let me
put<00:00:36.339> it<00:00:36.370> out<00:00:36.519> there<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.789> am<00:00:37.030> NOT<00:00:37.179> a<00:00:37.210> professional

I'm not certified any in any way I have
just<00:00:41.050> learned<00:00:41.379> some<00:00:41.499> things<00:00:41.769> along<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.249> way

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
just learned some things along the way

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.479 
just learned some things along the way
of<00:00:42.489> being<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.730> natural<00:00:43.179> for<00:00:43.329> over<00:00:43.570> 10<00:00:43.780> years<00:00:43.809> now

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
of being a natural for over 10 years now

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.910 
of being a natural for over 10 years now
for<00:00:45.489> starters<00:00:45.789> when<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.629> was<00:00:46.870> relaxed<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.559> was

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
for starters when I was relaxed I was

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.610 
for starters when I was relaxed I was
not<00:00:48.219> capable<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:49.149> retaining<00:00:49.749> moisture<00:00:50.109> for

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
not capable of retaining moisture for

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.950 
not capable of retaining moisture for
longer<00:00:51.010> than<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.519> day<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:52.059> would<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.839> to

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
longer than a day I would have to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.689 
longer than a day I would have to
moisturize<00:00:53.230> my<00:00:53.649> hair<00:00:53.679> morning<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:54.670> night

part<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.749> that<00:00:55.809> was<00:00:55.929> due<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.319> the<00:00:56.409> chemicals

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
part of that was due to the chemicals

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.160 
part of that was due to the chemicals
which<00:00:57.159> had<00:00:57.370> made<00:00:57.579> my<00:00:57.760> hair<00:00:57.999> a<00:00:58.210> low<00:00:58.899> porosity

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
which had made my hair a low porosity

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.399 
which had made my hair a low porosity
level<00:01:00.159> i<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.460> had<00:01:00.579> low<00:01:00.729> porosity<00:01:00.909> hair<00:01:01.409> now

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
level i just had low porosity hair now

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:03.869 
level i just had low porosity hair now
that<00:01:02.649> I've<00:01:02.769> natural<00:01:03.219> dive<00:01:03.339> been<00:01:03.519> natural<00:01:03.850> for

that I've natural dive been natural for

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.700 
that I've natural dive been natural for

a while I've discovered that you know

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.030 
a while I've discovered that you know
your<00:01:06.250> porosity<00:01:06.550> level<00:01:07.000> can<00:01:07.240> be<00:01:07.270> changed<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
your porosity level can be changed the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950 
your porosity level can be changed the
benefits<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.730> having<00:01:10.000> hair<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.630> retains

benefits of having hair that retains

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.140 
benefits of having hair that retains
moisture<00:01:11.260> for<00:01:11.920> starters<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.610> will<00:01:12.730> retain

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
moisture for starters you will retain

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.900 
moisture for starters you will retain
more<00:01:13.780> length<00:01:14.140> when<00:01:14.710> your<00:01:14.830> hair<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.070> dry<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.790> is

more length when your hair is dry it is

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.430 
more length when your hair is dry it is
a<00:01:15.940> lot<00:01:16.210> more<00:01:16.390> prone<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.750> breakage<00:01:17.290> so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
a lot more prone to breakage so

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.660 
a lot more prone to breakage so

moisture as for as long as possible the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.750 
moisture as for as long as possible the
second<00:01:23.440> thing<00:01:23.620> is<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.270> fritz<00:01:25.690> factor<00:01:26.290> now<00:01:26.860> my

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
second thing is the fritz factor now my

is concern but let's face it i can

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.420 
is concern but let's face it i can
create<00:01:35.050> my<00:01:35.230> own<00:01:35.260> fridge<00:01:35.620> when<00:01:35.830> I'm<00:01:35.920> separating

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
create my own fridge when I'm separating

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.910 
create my own fridge when I'm separating
twist<00:01:36.850> or<00:01:37.180> when<00:01:37.360> I'm<00:01:37.450> separating<00:01:37.990> braids<00:01:38.260> just

because I have not yet mastered the art

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.810 
because I have not yet mastered the art
of<00:01:41.080> separating<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.160> fluffing<00:01:42.430> without
