00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.769
 This plant here I'm going to use milk. 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:59.370
 condensed a latina is released 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:05.299
 a cup of powdered chocolate tea 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:10.890
 colleague of margarine-filled 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.650
 Let's put everything in the blender and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 hitting should blend well 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.270

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.200
 breaking the eggs and I'll take the skin off 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 egg yolk 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.440
 because to me that skin if I put 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.050
 together the brigadeiro will not be with 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:14.420
 smell in an egg and I do not want it is me 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.740
 I learned that when we make sweets 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 usually we take the skin 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.050
 because the candy does not stay with that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.950
 I smell of gold right then I go 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.950

 I separated it is clear now 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.790
 I waited a little for the yolk and the skin was safe. 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.390
 and I know how to separate clear 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:42.330
 I'm still there gemma and it simulates skin like this 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.180

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.860
