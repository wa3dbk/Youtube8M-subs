00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.450 

my<00:01:39.050> last<00:01:39.260> video<00:01:39.620> was<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:39.979> four-way

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
my last video was on the four-way

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.430 
my last video was on the four-way
coordination<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.840> was<00:01:41.960> finding<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.290> be

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
coordination and I was finding to be

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.109 
coordination and I was finding to be
when<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:42.979> was<00:01:43.130> opening<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.640> closing<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
when I was opening and closing the

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.480 
when I was opening and closing the
hi-hat<00:01:44.479> with<00:01:44.660> just<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.200> foot<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.100> what<00:01:46.460> I

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
hi-hat with just the foot and what I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.520 
hi-hat with just the foot and what I
liked<00:01:46.729> about<00:01:46.760> this<00:01:47.150> technique<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.260> frees

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
liked about this technique is it frees

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.469 
liked about this technique is it frees
up<00:01:48.560> both<00:01:49.040> hands<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.550> play<00:01:49.729> other<00:01:49.910> voices<00:01:50.360> on

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
up both hands to play other voices on

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.410 
up both hands to play other voices on
the<00:01:50.600> drumset<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.830> as<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.100> promised<00:01:52.610> here's<00:01:53.270> how

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the drumset so as I promised here's how

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.800 
the drumset so as I promised here's how
to<00:01:53.570> do<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:54.640> as<00:01:55.640> far<00:01:55.790> as<00:01:55.910> any<00:01:56.180> technique<00:01:56.660> is

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
to do it as far as any technique is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.330 
to do it as far as any technique is
concerned<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.680> really<00:01:57.800> feel<00:01:58.040> there's<00:01:58.220> a

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
concerned I don't really feel there's a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.670 
concerned I don't really feel there's a
right<00:01:58.640> versus<00:01:59.090> wrong<00:01:59.119> it's<00:01:59.960> really<00:02:00.259> about

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
right versus wrong it's really about

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.410 
right versus wrong it's really about
what<00:02:00.950> makes<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.310> feel<00:02:01.550> more<00:02:01.729> comfortable<00:02:02.119> so

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
what makes you feel more comfortable so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.540 
what makes you feel more comfortable so
with<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.229> mind<00:02:03.470> I'm<00:02:03.619> going<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.800> show<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.009> two

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
with that mind I'm going to show you two

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.760 
with that mind I'm going to show you two
ways<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.820> open<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.990> close<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.140> hi-hat<00:02:06.619> with

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
ways to open and close the hi-hat with

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.290 
ways to open and close the hi-hat with
just<00:02:07.190> your<00:02:07.310> foot<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:10.489> first<00:02:10.820> example<00:02:11.239> I'm

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
just your foot this first example I'm

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.000 
just your foot this first example I'm
going<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.480> show<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.320> method<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
going to show you is a method that I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.220 
going to show you is a method that I
used<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.459> use<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.630> way<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.870> technique

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
used to use so the way this technique

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.620 
used to use so the way this technique
works<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.940> start<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> ball

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
works is I'm going to start on the ball

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.920 
works is I'm going to start on the ball
of<00:02:17.780> my<00:02:17.900> foot<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:19.520> I'm<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.180> jump<00:02:20.690> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
of my foot and then I'm going to jump to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.130 
of my foot and then I'm going to jump to
the<00:02:21.230> heel<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:22.430> opens<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.420> hi-hats<00:02:23.870> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the heel which opens the hi-hats and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.290 
the heel which opens the hi-hats and
then<00:02:25.100> I'm<00:02:25.160> going<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.370> jump<00:02:25.820> back<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
then I'm going to jump back to the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.790 
then I'm going to jump back to the
starting<00:02:26.720> position<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.530> looks<00:02:27.739> like

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
starting position and that looks like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:51.880 
starting position and that looks like
this<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:49.959> here's<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> method<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.590> use<00:02:51.860> now

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this so here's the method that I use now

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.930 
this so here's the method that I use now
what<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.090> still<00:02:53.360> start<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> same

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
what I do is I still start in the same

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.370 
what I do is I still start in the same
starting<00:02:55.940> position<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.959> ball<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
starting position with the ball of the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.160 
starting position with the ball of the
foot<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.850> as<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.030> heel<00:02:59.209> comes<00:02:59.480> down<00:02:59.600> is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
foot and as the heel comes down is

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.410 
foot and as the heel comes down is
actually<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:01.250> ball<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.670> foot<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.030> opens

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
actually the ball of the foot that opens

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.350 
actually the ball of the foot that opens
the<00:03:02.690> cymbals<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:03.290> what<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.360> point

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the cymbals so what I do is I just point

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120 
the cymbals so what I do is I just point
my<00:03:05.480> toes<00:03:05.720> upward<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.590> allows<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
my toes upward and that allows the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.940 
my toes upward and that allows the
cymbals<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.790> read<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.360> ring<00:03:08.570> freely<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.350> then

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
cymbals to read to ring freely and then

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.590 
cymbals to read to ring freely and then
I<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.250> roll<00:03:10.700> back<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.299> starting

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
I just roll back to the starting

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.509 
I just roll back to the starting
position<00:03:11.720> which<00:03:12.290> closes<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.920> cymbals<00:03:13.370> and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
position which closes the cymbals and

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:40.600 
position which closes the cymbals and
that<00:03:14.209> looks<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.540> this

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.070 

the<00:03:41.610> beginning<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> video<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.720> showed

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
the beginning of the video I showed

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.199 
the beginning of the video I showed
three<00:03:43.410> ways<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.980> opening<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.610> closing<00:03:44.670> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
three ways of opening and closing the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.050 
three ways of opening and closing the
hi-hat<00:03:45.540> at<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> foot<00:03:46.020> we<00:03:46.170> did<00:03:46.440> off<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.880> beat

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
hi-hat at the foot we did off the beat

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.199 
hi-hat at the foot we did off the beat
on<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.810> beat<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.200> random<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.910> fun<00:03:51.060> to

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
on the beat and random and it's fun to

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.180 
on the beat and random and it's fun to
just<00:03:51.360> see<00:03:51.750> how<00:03:51.840> creative<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.530> get<00:03:52.770> for

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
just see how creative you can get for

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:13.160 
just see how creative you can get for
example<00:03:53.580> we<00:03:53.730> could<00:03:53.940> play<00:03:54.180> Guerro<00:04:11.930> or<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.020> can

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
example we could play Guerro or you can

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.870 
example we could play Guerro or you can
even<00:04:13.260> play<00:04:13.500> triplet<00:04:14.040> rhythms<00:04:14.400> where<00:04:14.700> you're

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
even play triplet rhythms where you're

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.970 
even play triplet rhythms where you're
opening<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.450> closing<00:04:15.870> every<00:04:16.320> other<00:04:16.410> note<00:04:16.709> so

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
opening and closing every other note so

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.660 
opening and closing every other note so
you're<00:04:17.100> playing<00:04:17.280> one<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.120> two
