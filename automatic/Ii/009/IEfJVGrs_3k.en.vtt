00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
think in the time so that if if that's

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.130 
think in the time so that if if that's
the<00:04:59.940> case<00:05:00.060> that's<00:05:00.240> actually<00:05:00.570> really<00:05:00.810> good<00:05:00.990> for

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
the case that's actually really good for

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.140 
the case that's actually really good for
me<00:05:01.260> because<00:05:01.410> last<00:05:01.740> year<00:05:01.890> i<00:05:01.980> think<00:05:02.340> i<00:05:02.370> was<00:05:02.490> 36

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150
