00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.340 
awesome and i'd be like do you're
awesome<00:03:54.300> too<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.660> then<00:03:54.930> that'd<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.320> end

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
awesome too and then that'd be the end

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.530 
awesome too and then that'd be the end
it<00:03:55.620> would<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.250> disconnection<00:03:57.120> man<00:03:57.390> i

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it would be like a disconnection man i

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
it would be like a disconnection man i
feel<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.930> connection<00:03:58.080> but<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.519> just<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
feel this connection but it's just the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.699 
feel this connection but it's just the
system<00:04:00.510> dubbed<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.560> update<00:04:02.000> okay<00:04:03.000> ah<00:04:03.650> well<00:04:04.650> I

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
system dubbed a update okay ah well I

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.290 
system dubbed a update okay ah well I
guess<00:04:04.950> that's<00:04:05.130> my<00:04:05.250> cue<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.519> end<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.760> video<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
guess that's my cue to end the video and

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.790 
guess that's my cue to end the video and
it's<00:04:06.600> also<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.110> am<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.590> should<00:04:07.769> probably

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
it's also for am so I should probably

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.370 
it's also for am so I should probably
good
