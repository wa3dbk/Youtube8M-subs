00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello dear hungry how are you ? 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 unlike many of you, too 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.610
 must constantly pay attention to my weight and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.840
 if I have a while 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.000
 exaggerated because of the many 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 barbecue parties, for example, I put as 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 balancing a low carb phase 1 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 It is also relatively easy for me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.230
 Example of something sweet to do without 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.420
 But it annoys me is the waiver 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 on tomato ketchup I thought so 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 that somehow created a remedy 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360
 I have to be and I am in bodybuilding 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 actually found the right recipe 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 and since I discovered that, there's 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 with me only this tomato ketchup 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.980
 which not only has the advantage of low carb 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.930
 to meet and be low in calories 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 no you can taste it too 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.370
 largely adapt 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.079
 we need tomatenmark for that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
 be alone no substitute for ketchup 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.640
 First, tastes and secondly 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.380
 It's up to 12.9 grams of carbs 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 100 do not dig quite so kv 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.540
 klich we need vegetable stock pepper 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 salt and paprika I take smoked 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.930
 paprika but you can be quite 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.530
 normal used with wise noble sweet 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.539
 or shiver 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.539
 we need it I recommend red wine 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.830
 or apple cider and sweetener that can 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.780
 be natural liquid 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729
 but since I always Süßkraut so 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100
 stevia plant on the balcony 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 of course I use this so far 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 Duty now comes the kür 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.900
 so spices against the ketchup 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.460
 to complement taste and here 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.619
 you can act very variable 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.479
 I choose basil 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.430
 garlic granules I could of course 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.580
 also squeeze a fresh clove of garlic 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.530
 and curry is the whole affair 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.750
 Conveniently given in a pot 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.720
 the tomato paste pour the vegetable broth 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.030
 supplement with sweetener or in one 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.840
 case some leaves of sweet herb pour on 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 season the vinegar with salt 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.150
 paprika and some pepper and supplement 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 then in optional with curry 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.170
 garlic and basil then everything 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.170
 Carry out thoroughly 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.790
 and on the stove plate and there 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.980
 can we touch it simmer 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.260
 occasionally also around to the desired 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.810
 has achieved consistency and because the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.820
 whole affair gamal squirts comes 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.850
 in between a lid on it better 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.660
 with me is the desired consistency 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.690
 Actually, always after five 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.030
 minutes and then if there is something 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.290
 I completely cooled the first glasses 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 take this year practical 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 Particles what we have filed then 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.600
 Judge looks at me holding ketchup 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.160
 not for long, if you think so 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.660
 want to consume longer period 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.430
 do you have to jam like that? 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.709
 So the glasses still with the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.209
 fill it with very hot mass and then it 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.870
 for about a quarter of an hour on the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.000
 ask 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.590
 shake the filled glasses a bit and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 turn up and then of course 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.370
 close and therefore not with the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.100
 strawberry jam is mistaken 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.020
 Label me the claire should also be with 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.120
 get rid of it and then replace it, of course 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.530
 through roses or patrick, what do I know 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.870
 I could with this recipe for me 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.550
 solve a real problem and also 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.410
 Tasty convinced this catcher 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.810
 I can not only recommend it 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.630
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.370
 preparation and then quite good 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.360
 appetite 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.070
 if he prefers something else 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.290
 would like to prepare for example 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.239
 peanut butter or marshmallow 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.260
 cream then just have a look 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.910
 put these videos in 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.769
 here remains to say until 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.769
 next time bye bye
