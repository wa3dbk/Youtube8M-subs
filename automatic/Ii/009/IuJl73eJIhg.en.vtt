these<00:01:02.820> 13<00:01:03.270> foot<00:01:03.539> tubes<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.409> absolutely

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
these 13 foot tubes are just absolutely

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.820 
these 13 foot tubes are just absolutely
fantastic<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.510> responsive<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.560> turn

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
fantastic the responsive they turn

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.880 
fantastic the responsive they turn
easily<00:01:08.420> they'll<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:09.659> surf<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.680> means

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
easily they'll still surf which means

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
easily they'll still surf which means
you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> good<00:01:11.729> old<00:01:11.970> surf<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.479> a

you can go and have a good old surf on a
wave<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.680> token<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.490> got

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
wave but same token you're actually got

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.780 
wave but same token you're actually got
the<00:01:14.970> stability<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the stability there to to make a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.140 
the stability there to to make a
difference<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.850> yeah<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
difference if you need to yeah and that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
difference if you need to yeah and that
just<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.420> could<00:01:21.810> fund<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:23.100> you're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
just really could fund so if you're

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.429 
just really could fund so if you're
thinking<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.670> quetta<00:01:23.970> rafting<00:01:24.439> Hey
