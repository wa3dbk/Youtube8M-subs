00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.640
 hi to all the boys here and ludo 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.839
 thorne and today I am in san marino that me 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.910
 I am seen the third tupin preview e 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.870
 I wanted to give you an opinion on dubbing 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.470
 although in reality there would be people 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.630
 a little more competent than I mean here 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.880
 we are quite at euphemism a lot of 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.580
 more but the good ludo tron that there is already a 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.380
 the name of two horns returns even 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.450
 unpronounceable is really good to be 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 the expertise of the maximum experts 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.989
 dubbing here on youtube italia yes 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.519
 some might say but there is also now 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.469
 we have to understand bullshit but they don't 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.210
 they are great like myself 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.850
 so now though an opinion on the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.620
 dubbing in two and parasitic in the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.159
 parasitic parasite like all the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 voiceovers 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.230
 but let's say the cartoon 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.719
 unfortunately he needs the voices and I have to 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.460
 say that this time I thought I have 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.409
 particularly appreciated the mix of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.269
 lupine team from the cremona team 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.210
 gicquel passing by fujiko mine 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.999
 coming to lupine iii I found maybe 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.550
 a little out of synch tear not 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.540
 Stefano works a little bit outside 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.310
 piazza king of rome 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.800
 but I must say that it is the voice that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.500
 perfect indeed to return with remembered 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.870
 his past voices I don't know now 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.690
 he had already doubled that he already had 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.310
 dubbed 23 on another occasion then 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.860
 It did not seem completely out 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.590
 part therefore it is not about 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.300
 that is, the perfect intention of the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.720
 fierce one speaks just what is me 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.470
 seemed out of sync yes maybe 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.170
 let's say that maybe it was like everyone else 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.630
 like all the modern Italian films of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.120
 Dubbing may have been done or even 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.470
 this with a little bit of a hurry with 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.780
 its sienna even I can there 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.870
 a need to pull it out since 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.950
 there is if the state has done abundantly 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.780
 a red marketing campaign 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.900
 involuntary with the initials of moreno i 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.670
 cloths and attention to me seems to protect 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.470
 even changed the senicar was sure the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.540
 acronym had changed however as I said 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.610
 already in my video on the channel he drafted the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 my channel of and con said in the level 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.300
 I did a review with masi paranza 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 we said this is hidden behind never 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.660
 of bari we never do you think 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 say hello to me and as I already said 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.170
 album my trip alex more and you listen to the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.570
 acronym becomes more digestible to honor the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.520
 true and my doubt remains on the fact 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.800
 that some are never understood 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.570
 words that is the clothes called moreno di 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.810
 you make yourself do the song some words 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.400
 angela, however, saw the rhythm of sound 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.519
 of the rep 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.110
 ok i'm doing this doing this 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.750
 gesture that means in quotation marks covers 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.250
 dr but not listen to me I liked me 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.019
 more like the molino part than giorgio 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.190
 vanni lacks the truth but therefore therefore but 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.630
 you think of a shirt I bought 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.190
 me too and still buys because 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.840
 size is rightly worn 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.580
 I can't not go around without it 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.830
 the middle level t-shirt 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.420
 but we tell you that beyond your criticism 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.940
 returning to the dubbing too 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.250
 we say self-criticism even if we are 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.840
 of the pests, however, is liked yes 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.990
 because regarding animation 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.380
 cannot exist arrived 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.670
 opening the loan of the item is one thing 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.230
 I liked it I liked the voices 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.670
 female and of the girl who becomes 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.100
 government wife is 5,000 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.380
 sensual I have to say sensual furniture 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.970
 delicate very sweet to watch from this 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.830
 headquarters because there seem to be some 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.780
 differences with greater violence e 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.210
 a continuity between the episodes which 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.920
 then he had never seemed to see there 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.590
 then for those who don't know this is one 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.640
 production if I'm not mistaken Italian-French 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.570
 yes yes then Italian locations 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.790
 totally teheran he made from Italians 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.890
 and French and in Japan this does not 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.630
 they still saw it as we are 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.730
 the world premiere for san marino 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.390
 San Marino comics then opportunity 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.970

 we are not like losers then 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.650
 see things one day after us but 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.260
 we look at are in the future know of 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.820
 past was very hard very low 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.620
 of the immense dog car at the next e 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.770
