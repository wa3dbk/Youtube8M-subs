00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
ready to slice up the placenta in the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
ready to slice up the placenta in the
sink<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> put<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.270> gloves<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
sink I'm going to put on some gloves and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
sink I'm going to put on some gloves and
then<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> drain<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> blood

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
then I'm going to drain all the blood

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
then I'm going to drain all the blood
out<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.030> placenta<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
out of the placenta this is the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
out of the placenta this is the

traditional Chinese medicine method and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
traditional Chinese medicine method and
so<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> starts<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so it starts by going down just to the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
so it starts by going down just to the
placenta<00:00:54.090> itself<00:00:56.270> there's<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.600> side

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
placenta itself there's the back side

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
placenta itself there's the back side
and<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.149> mama<00:01:00.329> side<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.660> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and and there's the mama side and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.920 
and and there's the mama side and then
we'll<00:01:04.290> steam<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> steamer<00:01:05.549> ready

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
slice it and put it on a dehydrator

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.620
