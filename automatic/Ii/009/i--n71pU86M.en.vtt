00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.979
 We're on the stand of Kion Pioneer's relief July is falling 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:19.199
 and he's warning now to introduce the novelties for 2011 July what's up 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.820
 next year from you from Neuss 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.319
 Jan o 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.769
 We have not been so lacking this time invested in new products but in the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.999
 old products damt product maintenance so operated 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 A exception is now the Smart Photo 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880
 Smartphones are but right 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.400
 because I do not have the same crank and rarely 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.520
 Actually talent system mediamarkt are able to serve that is actually 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.750
 unique in the market and of course always in the beautiful Zion 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.050
 Design of the work timeless im 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.310
 me personally wonder Wage field 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.730
 Pastor garden Dez SR m systems percent under beautiful pure 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.900
 otherwise there is not much to say 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.160
 Like the smart crank 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.200
 what are the key data of the crank weight living 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.880
 Freysinger about 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.320
 we are now percent 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.360
 that now depends entirely on the system on this so different 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.020
 but Ben 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 between 580 and 670 grams or so sure now all the data of course 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 not in the head, yes 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.530
 at the moment name 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.400
 Werner new systems 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.950
 the goals are addressed 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 pröll Pröll probably not cart TWINTEC Tiger how do you get there 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.250
 did not dare to ask 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.990
 no problem getting what else 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.799
 around 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.690
 what are the product-ways to say 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.720
 yes our main business this year 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 and percent, of course, it is close as well as the advantage that he has before others 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 to have 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.020
 such were 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 we are already percent possible very very easily 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.940
 I have to admit in percent magazines tests 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.810
 if we were also these always acceleration test winners though 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.869
 the stiffness 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.179
 Ziemer always dropped something at the rear wheel name 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.199
 of course it was close 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.059
 the Hag's diameter 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.549
 to increase scars from the rear wheel 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.069
 this causes other camps to warm up very strong large central warehouse now 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
 that used to be installed in the bottom bracket No 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.599
 as Pino Riesch we have cold now 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.419
 Karamac strengthens the way to go which has a very very low friction 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:37.689
 Eagle through 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.799
 is there 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.799
 absolutely no more wear anywhere 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.509
 round 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.019
 They are lighter than steel spear fifths that is called the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.189
 Responsiveness the show higher than steel 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.069
 the diameter 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.029
 caused that need more teeth here 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.509
 now ina merge that is 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.709
 Percent for trial driver is now quite interesting because the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.829
 Responsiveness that Bisky titles come to the intervention is now higher 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.659
 otherwise everything is the same 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.569
 Again, my philosophy is easy and yet stronger 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.679
 actually stronger 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.519
 is with carbon development and of course easier Thies 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.099
 I think that the hub 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.629
 is indestructible so slowly 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.039
 Fildern Coleen now is the good 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.810
 stay so Wesel 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 Unfortunately, the net proudly wear when I say Munich 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.640
 Thank you
