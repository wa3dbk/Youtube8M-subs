00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 Castilla 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.460
 Hello, I am making a book like living in my life . 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.870
 made 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 4 Today, I want to use my jeans to make a card wallet. 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 Yes 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:06.369
 a. Yes, I prepare paper shopping bag ion. 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.319
 You will. 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:16.960
 You've got a ready-made card trick. 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:21.190
 This is more than 0.5cm c on the day and here is a sense c size 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.080
 Because you get a card here and you know it's getting bulky. 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.080
 So it does not have to be exact, but it's 0.5 c bigger and 1 cm inside. 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.690
 Use the magazine to make the system bigger 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.440
 I have a system protest bonje you doing to Chapter 2 drafting thereon 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.440
 Adana 1 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:47.270
 And if you think the paper in the d version is a little weak, you can have two sheets. 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.960
 Acceptable decisions do characters go so easily Where did this 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.960
 4 5 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:02.440
 a ee ee ee ee 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:20.140
 4 You put two layers together, and you made me thick. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:25.150
 It is willing to make the corners will yeogieda the jeans you become one inside the extent 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 I think he's thinking a little bit. 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.150
 In this way, there is a Korean one-fold that is not one- third of two-fold. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.470
 It 's easy for you to sew it. 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.940
 So the part that is covered or gathered like this is cut off the part with the overlap . 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:47.200
 You can fix it by using the grass to cover 2/3 of the way. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.570
 Can you or an acceptable fixed with double-sided tape, glue stick, I with 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 This is a temporary fix. Only two-thirds like this. 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.040
 Paste inside jeans 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:18.900
 So if you do this in a pool, it will fall well, so in 0.5 units. 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.900
 It pierces the hole. 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 U 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.510
 222 There is no sewing on the outside. 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.640
 You just are you going to be going out twice, once again turning to the Home of guilt 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 I'll do it twice. 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.030
 I'm twice about the need to get started on the left hasyeoseo went to the camp tacking type 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.030
 This way. 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:53.630
 Example 4 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.210
 Then you can put him on this side. 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.910
 Use a glue stick 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.910
 So we finished the cover. 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.430
 Yes 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.310
 It would be nice if you could stitch it like you want. 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.760
 I'm deceiving you. You're walking and marking. 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:34.640
 It's ready . 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:38.450
 At intervals of 1cm intervals, you want to pierce the hole in the new 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.720
 This is the first thing you do . 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.170
 I want you to mark me like this Mr. 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.580

 Going to walk also this drill holes 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:03.140
 Then you can just bind it . The length of the ribbon is 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.280
 Geomyeon you the ribbon you doing about 15 times 4 times 4 times 5 LAD 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.620
 So 4 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.130
 Gets the ribbon come to the surface you're starting from first-party side of yogeo 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:18.440
 For example, among the thorns came up'm 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:21.830
 You're going to have a ribbon, so please put in a little more. Then go to the left.

 Knitted subside regardless visible on the right 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.210
 The next move, and the first one below 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.949

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.949
 Ah ah ah ah ah 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.050
