hi<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.100> Alison<00:00:05.580> from<00:00:05.730> Mahalo<00:00:06.120> comm<00:00:06.660> and

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
hi it's Alison from Mahalo comm and

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi it's Alison from Mahalo comm and
today<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.529> looking<00:00:07.649> at<00:00:07.890> double<00:00:08.250> digit

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
today we're looking at double digit

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
today we're looking at double digit
subtraction<00:00:09.019> we<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> way<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.410> doing<00:00:10.679> this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
subtraction we have a way of doing this

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.220 
subtraction we have a way of doing this
it's<00:00:11.190> called<00:00:11.370> an<00:00:11.639> algorithm<00:00:11.969> now<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.840> best

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
it's called an algorithm now the best

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.020 
it's called an algorithm now the best
thing<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> start<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
thing to do when you start out is to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
thing to do when you start out is to
rewrite<00:00:15.389> whatever<00:00:16.049> you're<00:00:16.199> subtracting

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
rewrite whatever you're subtracting

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.250 
rewrite whatever you're subtracting
vertically<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.850> let's<00:00:18.119> do<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.020> I'm<00:00:19.109> going

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
vertically so let's do that so I'm going

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.359 
vertically so let's do that so I'm going
to<00:00:19.289> rewrite<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.710> 77<00:00:20.279> minus<00:00:20.789> 29<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:23.869> and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
to rewrite my 77 minus 29 like this and

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.589 
to rewrite my 77 minus 29 like this and
when<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> make<00:00:27.570> sure

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
when you do this you want to make sure

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
when you do this you want to make sure
that<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.410> ones<00:00:28.710> digits<00:00:29.279> lined<00:00:29.730> up

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that you get your ones digits lined up

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.780 
that you get your ones digits lined up
and<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.480> tens<00:00:30.810> digits<00:00:31.349> lined<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.579> way

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and your tens digits lined up that way

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.010 
and your tens digits lined up that way
you'll<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:32.969> sure<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:33.660> doing<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.989> right

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you'll be sure you're doing the right

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.639 
you'll be sure you're doing the right
thing<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.710> let's<00:00:35.280> take<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> look<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:36.649> first

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
thing so let's take a look now first

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.530 
thing so let's take a look now first
let's<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.040> look<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> ones<00:00:38.790> column<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
let's just look at the ones column it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
let's just look at the ones column it
looks<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.200> 7<00:00:40.950> minus<00:00:41.370> 9

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
looks like I'm doing 7 minus 9

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
looks like I'm doing 7 minus 9
anytime<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> you're<00:00:43.170> doing<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
anytime that you're doing this and the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
anytime that you're doing this and the
number<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> top<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.300> smaller<00:00:45.870> than<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
number on the top is smaller than the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
number on the top is smaller than the
number<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> bottom<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> do

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
number on the bottom you have to do

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.119 
number on the bottom you have to do
what's<00:00:48.180> called<00:00:48.420> borrowing<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.770> here's<00:00:50.010> how

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
what's called borrowing so here's how

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
what's called borrowing so here's how
that<00:00:50.190> works<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:51.930> borrow

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that works I'm going to actually borrow

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.040 
that works I'm going to actually borrow
10<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.550> tens<00:00:53.850> column<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> over

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
10 from my tens column and put it over

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
10 from my tens column and put it over
here<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> instead<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.879> 7<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:58.699> 1

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
here so instead of 7 I'm going to take 1

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
here so instead of 7 I'm going to take 1
away<00:00:59.820> from<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.600> call<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.960> 6<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> then

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
away from that and call it 6 and then

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
away from that and call it 6 and then
I'm<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.309> part<00:01:02.579> borrow<00:01:02.879> 10<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I'm going to part borrow 10 and put it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
I'm going to part borrow 10 and put it
in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> ones<00:01:04.290> column<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> actually

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
in the ones column so what I actually

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
in the ones column so what I actually
have<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.360> instead<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> 7<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.590> 17<00:01:08.750> 17

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have here then instead of 7 is 17 17

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.000 
have here then instead of 7 is 17 17
minus<00:01:10.200> 9<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.770> 8<00:01:11.540> now<00:01:12.540> let's<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.500> have

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
minus 9 is 8 now let's look here I have

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.359 
minus 9 is 8 now let's look here I have
instead<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> 7<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.270> 6<00:01:15.630> minus<00:01:16.170> 2<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.890> 4

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
instead of 7 I have 6 minus 2 which is 4

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.990 
instead of 7 I have 6 minus 2 which is 4
and<00:01:18.409> that's<00:01:19.409> 48<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.430> 77<00:01:21.240> minus<00:01:21.840> 29<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.710> 48<00:01:23.430> now

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and that's 48 so 77 minus 29 is 48 now

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.280 
and that's 48 so 77 minus 29 is 48 now
if<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.420> sure<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> right

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
if you're not sure if you got it right

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
if you're not sure if you got it right
you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.650> always<00:01:25.799> add<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.759> together

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you can always add these two together

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420 
you can always add these two together
and<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> should<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:28.020> 77<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> good<00:01:29.310> way

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and you should get 77 that's a good way

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
and you should get 77 that's a good way
to<00:01:29.490> check<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:30.960> take<00:01:31.170> another<00:01:31.470> look<00:01:31.710> at

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to check so let's take another look at

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.760 
to check so let's take another look at
it<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.070> maybe<00:01:32.280> three<00:01:32.610> digits<00:01:33.320> let's<00:01:34.320> say<00:01:34.560> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it with maybe three digits let's say we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.420 
it with maybe three digits let's say we
have<00:01:35.390> 106<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.250> let's<00:01:38.250> subtract<00:01:38.850> 29<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
have 106 and let's subtract 29 from that

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.240 
have 106 and let's subtract 29 from that
and<00:01:42.259> again<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:43.560> sure<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.130> your

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and again make sure that you have your

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
and again make sure that you have your
ones<00:01:44.490> digit<00:01:44.939> lined<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.600> tens<00:01:45.869> digits

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
ones digit lined up your tens digits

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
ones digit lined up your tens digits
lined<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.220> hundreds<00:01:47.640> digits

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
lined up if you have hundreds digits

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.510 
lined up if you have hundreds digits
make<00:01:48.210> sure<00:01:48.360> they're<00:01:48.570> lined<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:49.020> okay<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
make sure they're lined up okay so it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
make sure they're lined up okay so it
looks<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.909> we're<00:01:51.119> trying<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.570> 6<00:01:51.960> minus<00:01:52.619> 9

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
looks like we're trying to do 6 minus 9

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
looks like we're trying to do 6 minus 9
and<00:01:53.520> since<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.270> number<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.960> smaller<00:01:55.350> than

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and since this number is smaller than

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
and since this number is smaller than
that<00:01:55.619> number<00:01:56.100> we're<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> borrow<00:01:57.090> again

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that number we're going to borrow again

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.289 
that number we're going to borrow again
so<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.920> column<00:01:59.430> over<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.149> we

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
so we go one column over and see if we

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
so we go one column over and see if we
can<00:02:00.479> borrow<00:02:00.630> 10<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.549> here<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> we

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
can borrow 10 so we look here and we

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.020 
can borrow 10 so we look here and we
don't<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.840> anything<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> zero<00:02:05.280> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
don't have anything we have a zero so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
don't have anything we have a zero so
what<00:02:06.149> we're<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.650 
what we're going to do is we're going to
borrow<00:02:07.530> from<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.890> column<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.179> change

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
borrow from this column and then change

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.240 
borrow from this column and then change
this<00:02:09.869> number<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.739> borrow<00:02:10.979> from

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this number here and then borrow from

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.990 
this number here and then borrow from
this<00:02:11.430> column<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.910> change<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.390> number<00:02:12.599> here

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
this column and change this number here

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.780 
this column and change this number here
so<00:02:13.330> let's<00:02:13.540> go<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.080> more<00:02:14.140> column<00:02:14.560> over<00:02:14.830> instead

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so let's go one more column over instead

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.640 
so let's go one more column over instead
of<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> 1<00:02:16.300> we're<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:16.720> gonna<00:02:16.810> make<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> zero

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
of a 1 we're just gonna make this a zero

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.530 
of a 1 we're just gonna make this a zero
and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.520> we're<00:02:18.610> gonna<00:02:18.700> make<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.150> instead

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and then we're gonna make this instead

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.070 
and then we're gonna make this instead
of<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.720> zero<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.230> 10<00:02:20.620> now<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.850> really<00:02:22.450> am<00:02:22.630> trying<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
of a zero a 10 now I really am trying to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.590 
of a zero a 10 now I really am trying to
borrow<00:02:23.320> into<00:02:23.620> my<00:02:23.710> ones<00:02:23.950> column<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.390> I've

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
borrow into my ones column so now I've

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.810 
borrow into my ones column so now I've
got<00:02:25.810> ten<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.320> my<00:02:26.440> tens<00:02:26.710> column<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.520> borrow

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
got ten in my tens column let's borrow

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.940 
got ten in my tens column let's borrow
so<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:28.780> gonna<00:02:28.930> take<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.410> away<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.920> so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
so I'm gonna take one away from it so

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
so I'm gonna take one away from it so
instead<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> ten

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
instead of ten

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.360 
instead of ten
this<00:02:31.150> becomes<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.690> nine<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.170> instead<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.100> six

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
this becomes a nine and instead of a six

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.890 
this becomes a nine and instead of a six
that<00:02:33.940> becomes<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> 16<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:35.740> let's<00:02:36.130> subtract

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that becomes a 16 so now let's subtract

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.680 
that becomes a 16 so now let's subtract
16<00:02:37.900> minus<00:02:38.290> 9<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.800> 7<00:02:39.180> 9<00:02:40.180> minus<00:02:40.870> 2<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.590> 7<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.690> 106

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
16 minus 9 is 7 9 minus 2 is 7 so 106

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.070 
16 minus 9 is 7 9 minus 2 is 7 so 106
minus<00:02:44.200> 29<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.459> 77<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.330> know<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.900> looks

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
minus 29 is actually 77 I know it looks

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.900 
minus 29 is actually 77 I know it looks
a<00:02:47.230> little<00:02:47.320> messy<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.100> actually<00:02:48.520> really

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
a little messy but it's actually really

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.510 
a little messy but it's actually really
quite<00:02:49.180> simple<00:02:49.590> anytime<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.860> number<00:02:51.280> is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
quite simple anytime this number is

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.430 
quite simple anytime this number is
greater<00:02:51.790> than<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.390> number<00:02:52.420> below<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.110> you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
greater than the number below it you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.949 
greater than the number below it you
just<00:02:53.680> borrow<00:02:53.950> 10<00:02:54.400> over<00:02:54.910> from<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.420> column<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
just borrow 10 over from one column to

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.660 
just borrow 10 over from one column to
the<00:02:56.230> right<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.040> don't<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.430> anything

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
the right and if you don't have anything

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.820 
the right and if you don't have anything
there<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.540> go<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.870> column<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.350> right<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
there you go one column to the right and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.650 
there you go one column to the right and
you<00:03:00.130> borrow<00:03:00.370> again<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.120> takes<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.540> little

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
you borrow again it takes a little

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.330 
you borrow again it takes a little
practice<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.350> don't<00:03:02.590> worry<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:03.010> actually

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
practice but don't worry it's actually

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.280 
practice but don't worry it's actually
really<00:03:03.550> easy<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.090> that's<00:03:04.540> how<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.930> double

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
really easy and that's how you do double

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.650 
really easy and that's how you do double
