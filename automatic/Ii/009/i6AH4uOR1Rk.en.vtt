00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
interested in us helping design a ski

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
interested in us helping design a ski
and<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.130> were<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.400> excited<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.000> that

and we were really excited about that
and<00:00:24.930> amazing<00:00:25.529> line<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> skis<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:26.519> but

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and amazing line of skis already but

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
and amazing line of skis already but
they<00:00:26.849> definitely<00:00:27.410> there's<00:00:28.410> room<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.039> grow<00:00:29.310> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
they definitely there's room to grow so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.730 
they definitely there's room to grow so
this<00:00:29.880> he<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.390> fits<00:00:30.630> nicely<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.320> between

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this he really fits nicely in between

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.450 
this he really fits nicely in between
the<00:00:32.669> playfulness<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> twin<00:00:34.620> natured<00:00:35.160> Ben

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the playfulness and the twin natured Ben

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.590 
the playfulness and the twin natured Ben
Shetler<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:38.100> traditional<00:00:38.760> ski

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
Shetler and the more traditional ski

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.080 
Shetler and the more traditional ski

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
like the Atlas this really fits in

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.479 
like the Atlas this really fits in
nicely<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> rest<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> line<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
nicely with the rest of the line and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.840 
nicely with the rest of the line and
offers<00:00:45.000> something<00:00:45.559> new<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.120 

the<00:01:00.630> most<00:01:00.810> important<00:01:01.230> thing<00:01:01.380> basically<00:01:01.650> about

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
the most important thing basically about

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.650 
the most important thing basically about
the<00:01:02.220> ski<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.550> far<00:01:02.790> as<00:01:02.880> like<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> technical

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the ski as far as like the technical

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500 
the ski as far as like the technical
features<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.230> it's<00:01:05.160> 117<00:01:05.790> underfoot<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
features is that it's 117 underfoot so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
features is that it's 117 underfoot so
it's<00:01:06.660> still<00:01:06.870> like<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.230> this<00:01:07.380> nice<00:01:07.680> range<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it's still like in this nice range so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's still like in this nice range so
the<00:01:09.360> automatic<00:01:09.660> has<00:01:10.310> camber<00:01:11.310> underfoot<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the automatic has camber underfoot and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
the automatic has camber underfoot and
the<00:01:13.230> full<00:01:13.500> powder<00:01:13.950> rocker<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> tip<00:01:14.790> but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the full powder rocker and the tip but

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
the full powder rocker and the tip but
in<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.750> tail<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.580> bit<00:01:17.730> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
in the tail it's just a little bit of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
in the tail it's just a little bit of
rocker<00:01:18.120> so<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.080> still<00:01:19.260> has<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.410> pretty<00:01:19.650> stiff

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
rocker so it still has a pretty stiff

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.210 
rocker so it still has a pretty stiff
tail<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.580> stable<00:01:20.940> tail<00:01:21.710> which<00:01:22.710> means

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
tail a pretty stable tail which means

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.290 
tail a pretty stable tail which means
when<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.730> a<00:01:23.760> turn

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
when you make a turn

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.120 
when you make a turn
you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> still<00:01:24.810> break<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> loose<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you can still break it loose and kind of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
you can still break it loose and kind of
schmear<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> move

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

schmear and kind of like kind of move
around<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> ski<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.300> like<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
around you know the ski you know like a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810 
around you know the ski you know like a
more<00:01:30.870> playful<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.010> also<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.640> will

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
power boosters in there which is a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.219 
power boosters in there which is a
titanium<00:01:56.009> plate<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.780> adds<00:01:57.960> stability

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
titanium plate that just adds stability

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.920 
titanium plate that just adds stability
in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> rocker<00:01:58.950> area<00:01:59.400> the<00:02:00.240> automatic<00:02:00.720> has<00:02:00.900> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
in the rocker area the automatic has a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.510 
in the rocker area the automatic has a
step-down<00:02:01.470> sidewall<00:02:02.160> which<00:02:02.880> basically<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
step-down sidewall which basically is a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.120 
step-down sidewall which basically is a
really<00:02:05.970> good<00:02:06.119> way<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.390> having<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:07.080> little<00:02:07.950> less

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
really good way of having a little less

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.750 
really good way of having a little less
weight<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> ski<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.270> underfoot<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.080> has

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
weight to the ski but underfoot it has

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.480 
weight to the ski but underfoot it has
very<00:02:11.760> good<00:02:11.960> stability<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.860> kind<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> ski

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
very good stability it's kind of the ski

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.120
