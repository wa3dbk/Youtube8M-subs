00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.779
 all right 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.970
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.770
 of the best and welcome to a new 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.590
 minecraft video in which I bring you 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.060
 a new one we have called mini bots 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.590
 if gentlemen in this way add some 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.210
 robots well epic milestones and some that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.520
 another little thing that really does not have much 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 meaning right now because this 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.000
 is a mode that is still in progress 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.980
 then we can interesting are the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.440
 robots that I'm going to teach them in 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.940
 a few moments not starting with the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.010
 envelopes that we have here that are two 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 envelopes we have the aluminum that would be 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.330
 this as you can see here we have it and 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.520
 we just put it in the oven and we 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.000
 is going to give the ingot then here what 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.490
 it would be the copper that practically the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.140
 copper and with copper as well as I 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.440
 wanted to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 copper wire and a motor the motor of 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.379
 dita has no use then then here 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.590
 we have the engine as you can see 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.330
 really weird does not do anything you're not 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.100
 chopped on all sides of post 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.140
 reds where I put everything and really not 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 the engine does nothing at the moment this is a 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.500
 engine that is still in progress 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.910
 so that's why there are some things 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 that they lack but at the most 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.340
 interesting 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.229
 let's see below how to put 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.210
 Here are blocks too, so 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.610
 are very logical to create that we can 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.050
 declare things with them and nothing else 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.909
 quite puts a lot of aluminum what 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.009
 we have to put a lot of copper and we 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.960
 is going to give then the block cited and is already 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.850
 tool does not have much science 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.160
 so then now we go with the super 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 mobs with some of these modes you have to 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.340
 be very careful since you can 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.990
 kill very easily then good 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 we started with the mini friendly 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.979
 helicopter that this is one of the modes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.840
 that is not hostile and so good is a 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.880
 only I need that has good 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.399
 good sound animation and good design 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.369
 it's really funny then 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.920
 do nothing we will be flying and if 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.750
 we give what would be fm hs that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 I know this one this way really 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.420
 it's easy, we're not here 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.310
 copper wire that in this way and a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 aluminum ingot then since 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 let's have that we give right click we give to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.400
 and hearts now we will follow the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 helicopter and he will defend us all over 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580
 eternity yes gentlemen that is let's say 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.900
 prisoners the zombies down here on this 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.209
 tree so you do not burn you go to a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 come from March or by who knows 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 we who are wines attack we help 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
 sir and cupper kill them in helicopter 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.180
 they are discussion you die and because you have 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.220
 a head is close 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.750
 pomegranates so we get to defend 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.700
 orienting I think that there it is there is 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.190
 thank you very much sir helicopter is 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.320
 you very kind to us but beware 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.360
 If you hit the law, I'll be copero 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.680
 it is when you come back hostile and you will want them 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800
 kill then you have to be careful with 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.959
 that this is a mini firefighter key this one 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.340
 you approach him he was going to explode then 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.140
 I definitely do not think they want 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.200
 fight against him I hope he does not kill me 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.709
 I hope not debate this exploded out 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 good 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.800
 the helicopter helped me but good 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.330
 he pointed out that nothing else comes close to you 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.820
 explodes in the face and you kill yourself like a 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.680
 flu so they understand we make a mini 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.040
 tank in mini tank 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 enable this is going to shoot us since 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.010
 they fear may also put 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.840
 optimistic that imitates that almost kills us 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.150
 but well there we have it and finally 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.760
 we have the mini helicopter but version 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.680
 aggressive for that will move to creative 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.350
 because if it kills me very easily it is a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.450
 helicopter likewise if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.190
 if it's the same as the other one, maybe it changes 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.830
 one thing is not really the same but this 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.390
 in the way and the aggressive way this one 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.620
 will attack the first time I see you and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.250
 will act as an expense then leave 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.250
 good 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.540
 and life is there and nothing is going to happen with 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.400
 attack where is where is good no longer 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.470
 are to be going to appear others to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.680
 who achieve these parables and will be 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.720
 as gas and killed one of these is very 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.129
 complicated as he imagined why 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.080
 because they are in the air nothing more 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.239
 shooting you like a look without mentioning 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.290
 or something to knock them down and knock them down and 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.269
 kill them 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.620
 then people more or less in this 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.200
 consists this mode also added a 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.549
 mini pistolita which is a mini gong 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.769
 also with this one can kill folk and 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.709
 no control 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.209
 we already killed him but it is minimal he does not have 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.470
 character this minimum people do not have to 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.750
 take out of the inventory when you have a 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.520
 character because it's a character that 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.979
 you need a mini soccer king of 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.900
 ministers a mini one knows and these two 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.030
 they keep flapping as I tell them it 's a 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.830
 modem that in progress that was entertaining 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.120
 especially for the mini bots I'm 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.280
 sure that in the future add more 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.900
 interesting robots and they are therefore 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.600
 parents I do not expect you love this 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.479
 mode people with nothing more to say I would 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.340
 I'm saying goodbye if you liked this 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.280
 video do not forget they left 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.650
 So he had forgotten to tell them that 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.740
 helicopters loose bullion 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.300
 aluminum then yes yes in the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.030
 description have the way so that 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.530
 you could install it very easily 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.910
 without problems and without complications 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.040
 then we go to the next 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.040
 goodbye people and shout
