00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
art and a white like putty I'm going to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.130 
art and a white like putty I'm going to
take<00:00:31.850> equal<00:00:32.850> amount<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> each<00:00:35.600> in<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.690> hand<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
take equal amount of each in my hand and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.490 
take equal amount of each in my hand and
then<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:38.040> mix<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.730> together<00:00:39.090> until<00:00:39.750> they

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
then just mix them together until they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.940 
then just mix them together until they
form<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.280> sort<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.210> solid<00:00:42.510> blue<00:00:42.870> light<00:00:43.230> more

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

take<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> minute<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:48.450> sort<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.320> mixing<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.890> my

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
take a minute of sort of mixing in my

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.080 
take a minute of sort of mixing in my
hands<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> does<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.460> does<00:00:53.760> start
