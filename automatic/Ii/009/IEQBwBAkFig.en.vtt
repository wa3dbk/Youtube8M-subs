 Welcome once again to the world 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.780
 unknown point is in this video 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.270
 program managers so to speak 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.540
 to bring all that knowledge to you so 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.390
 intrinsic of social philosophy are 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.100
 josemi and the angel lord we are here with 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.290
 our angel guest because we come to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.150
 talk about the seagulls what about the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 seagulls when they migrate angel they do 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.910
 peak peak well arrived at this 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.979
 point we have two possibilities the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.770
 first would be the return of the big-bang the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.620
 process which resulted in the creation 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.620
 of our planet not and the second 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.229
 option would be that everything is the result of 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.330
 our imagination is to say our 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.880
 head from the hypothalamus and the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.250
 attraction because that car has gone without 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.810
 driver I swear I do not know if you remember in 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.670
 a video program that we did a long time ago 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.890
 time on my channel together with our 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.530
 fellow angel that you told us 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.360
 Angel 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.970
 you imagine that the Canary Islands 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.450
 they select the birds worth if I got stung 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.830
 they do everything to you the most of the area to a 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.020
 3.5 gigahertz speed 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.640
 do you think will happen if you peak 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.270
 all the sea at that speed 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.410
 if the splash would create a portal towards 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.750
 the present 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.120
 that would take us right to the age in the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.940
 that we are now which is very 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.430
 interesting then well let's leave the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.110
 Birds theme aside but 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.640
 also imagine that I mess with the 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.640
 two feet inside the kangaroo's bag
