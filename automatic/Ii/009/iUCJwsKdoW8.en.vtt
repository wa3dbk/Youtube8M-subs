notice<00:00:44.700> builder<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:52.580> use<00:00:53.580> black<00:00:54.000> tin<00:00:54.330> foil

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
notice builder I use black tin foil

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
notice builder I use black tin foil
that's<00:00:54.809> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.110> made<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:55.530> intense<00:00:56.160> light

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's kind of made for intense light

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.070 
that's kind of made for intense light
and<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.030> holds<00:00:57.150> up<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:57.540> against<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> kind

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
and it holds up well against that kind

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.080 
and it holds up well against that kind
of<00:00:58.170> stuff<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.220> much<00:00:59.370> any<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.030> of

and<00:01:26.000> we're<00:01:26.330> gonna<00:01:26.420> take<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.990> smaller<00:01:27.710> light<00:01:28.010> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and we're gonna take a smaller light and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
we're gonna paint we're gonna use light

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.440 
we're gonna paint we're gonna use light
painting<00:01:30.830> techniques<00:01:31.190> where<00:01:31.880> we're<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.300> to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
painting techniques where we're going to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.850 
painting techniques where we're going to
take<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:33.050> longer<00:01:33.650> exposure<00:01:34.180> using<00:01:35.180> our<00:01:35.570> HD<00:01:36.380> SLR

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
take a longer exposure using our HD SLR

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.500 
take a longer exposure using our HD SLR
camera<00:01:37.250> maybe<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.550> two<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:38.060> four<00:01:38.240> second

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
camera maybe a two to four second

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.020 
camera maybe a two to four second
exposure<00:01:38.780> where<00:01:39.500> we<00:01:39.920> take<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.520> we're

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
exposure where we take it and we're

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.030 
exposure where we take it and we're
going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.300> paint<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.290> eye<00:01:42.320> right<00:01:42.590> here

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
going to paint the eye right here

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.800 
going to paint the eye right here
then<00:01:43.520> we're<00:01:43.670> going<00:01:43.820> out<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.150> paint<00:01:44.330> this<00:01:44.480> you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
then we're going out and paint this you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.580 
then we're going out and paint this you
need<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.680> set<00:01:45.860> up<00:01:45.950> come<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.160> stand<00:01:46.580> for<00:01:47.590> our

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
need to set up come to stand for our

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.290 
need to set up come to stand for our
letters<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.100> sit<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:49.340> once<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:49.910> cut<00:01:50.060> them<00:01:50.210> all

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
letters to sit on once we cut them all

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.000 
letters to sit on once we cut them all
out<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:51.080> hangs<00:01:51.260> here<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:51.950> a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
out so it hangs here it's in a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.470 
out so it hangs here it's in a
stationary<00:01:52.520> position<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:53.120> can<00:01:53.150> paint

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
stationary position and we can paint

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.240 
stationary position and we can paint
with<00:01:53.660> light<00:01:53.840> with<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.650> being<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:54.980> same

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
with light with it being in the same

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.760 
with light with it being in the same
setup<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.630> lights<00:01:56.869> gonna<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> little<00:01:57.650> bit

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
setup the lights gonna have a little bit

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.310 
setup the lights gonna have a little bit
of<00:01:57.890> variation<00:01:58.160> but<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> movement<00:01:59.320> stand

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
of variation but not the movement stand

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:12.700 
of variation but not the movement stand
here

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.760 

cool<00:02:13.940> okay<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.270> my<00:02:15.390> nice<00:02:15.569> big<00:02:16.140> bin<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
cool okay so I got my nice big bin of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.500 
cool okay so I got my nice big bin of
little<00:02:17.220> lights<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.610> I've<00:02:17.790> collected<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
little lights that I've collected I

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.970 
little lights that I've collected I
don't<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:18.959> I'm<00:02:19.020> gonna<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.260> any<00:02:19.410> lasers<00:02:19.770> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
don't think I'm gonna do any lasers and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
don't think I'm gonna do any lasers and
also<00:02:20.190> pointing<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> laser<00:02:21.060> near<00:02:21.450> your<00:02:21.569> camera

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
also pointing a laser near your camera

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.830 
also pointing a laser near your camera
lens<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.640> sketchy<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.060> could<00:02:24.270> really

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
lens can be sketchy and could really

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.840 
lens can be sketchy and could really
mess<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.290> your<00:02:25.440> processor<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.790> be

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
mess up your processor so this would be

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.449 
mess up your processor so this would be
kind<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> cool<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:34.170> need<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.709> mindful<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
kind of cool you need to be mindful of a

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.490 
kind of cool you need to be mindful of a
flare<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.510> right<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:36.930> that's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
flare and you see right there that's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.990 
flare and you see right there that's
gonna<00:02:37.709> create<00:02:37.920> somewhat<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.370> flare<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
gonna create somewhat of a flare and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.510 
gonna create somewhat of a flare and
that's<00:02:39.900> cool<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.860> certain<00:02:41.220> thing<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.489> a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
that's cool for a certain thing like a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.190 
that's cool for a certain thing like a
beer<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.180> died<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> flare<00:02:42.900> that'd<00:02:43.080> be

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
beer I was died with the flare that'd be

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.750 
beer I was died with the flare that'd be
cool<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> need<00:02:44.130> be<00:02:44.220> mindful<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.670> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
cool but you need be mindful of that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.990 
cool but you need be mindful of that
because<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.989> flaring<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
because if it's flaring out then the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
because if it's flaring out then the
letters<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:49.200> gonna<00:02:49.320> be<00:02:49.470> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.800> little

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
letters it's gonna be kind of a little

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.240 
letters it's gonna be kind of a little
busy<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.200> trick<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:52.800> able<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.010> paint

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
busy so the trick is to be able to paint

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.160 
busy so the trick is to be able to paint
with<00:02:53.430> white<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.940> not<00:02:54.120> flare<00:02:54.570> out<00:02:54.750> too<00:02:54.959> much

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
with white but not flare out too much

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.410 
with white but not flare out too much
that's<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.430> positioning<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> camera<00:02:57.239> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that's that's positioning the camera so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420 
that's that's positioning the camera so
there<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.230> right<00:02:58.530> there<00:02:58.560> like

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
there you go you see right there like

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.330 
there you go you see right there like
you<00:02:59.550> could<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> light<00:03:00.180> here<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:01.340> it's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
you could see the light here but it's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.270 
you could see the light here but it's
not<00:03:02.459> flaring<00:03:02.760> too<00:03:03.060> much

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:33.300 

take<00:03:11.080> 1002

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.560 

it's<00:03:34.310> always<00:03:34.550> good<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.910> have<00:03:35.060> two<00:03:35.120> different

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
it's always good to have two different

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.300 
it's always good to have two different
game<00:03:35.690> plans<00:03:35.930> going<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.320> if<00:03:36.440> one<00:03:36.590> doesn't<00:03:36.740> work

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
game plans going in if one doesn't work

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.080 
game plans going in if one doesn't work
I<00:03:37.340> used<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:39.020> of<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.200> thicker<00:03:40.090> fiber-optic

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
I used a kind of a thicker fiber-optic

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.930 
I used a kind of a thicker fiber-optic
strand<00:03:41.710> where<00:03:42.710> they<00:03:42.920> see<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.460> almost

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
strand where they see this is almost

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.500 
strand where they see this is almost
about<00:03:44.210> a<00:03:44.570> sizable<00:03:45.230> quarter<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.880> where<00:03:46.880> when

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
about a sizable quarter and where when

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.280 
about a sizable quarter and where when
we<00:03:47.720> when<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.290> highlight<00:03:48.740> the<00:03:49.460> Y<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:51.140> gonna

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
we when I highlight the Y it's gonna

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.070 
we when I highlight the Y it's gonna
fill<00:03:51.530> up<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.770> entire<00:03:52.160> area<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.900> there<00:03:54.020> won't

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
fill up the entire area so there won't

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.770 
fill up the entire area so there won't
be<00:03:54.200> any<00:03:54.290> gaps<00:03:54.650> yeah<00:03:55.640> it's<00:03:55.940> kind<00:03:56.210> of<00:03:56.240> a<00:03:56.390> smoother

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
be any gaps yeah it's kind of a smoother

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.110 
be any gaps yeah it's kind of a smoother
consistent<00:03:57.350> looking<00:03:57.710> feel<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.820> it's<00:03:58.970> not<00:03:59.090> a

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
consistent looking feel and it's not a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:08.200 
consistent looking feel and it's not a
showy<00:04:00.070> doesn't<00:04:01.070> stand<00:04:01.310> out<00:04:01.490> as<00:04:01.610> much<00:04:07.210> alright

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
showy doesn't stand out as much alright

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.140 
showy doesn't stand out as much alright
since<00:04:09.310> cyfle<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.340> got<00:04:10.520> into<00:04:10.790> South<00:04:11.000> by

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
since cyfle I got into South by

since cyfle I got into South by
Southwest<00:04:11.450> we've<00:04:11.870> made<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.110> little<00:04:12.380> cut<00:04:12.860> out<00:04:12.890> of

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
Southwest we've made a little cut out of

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.540 
Southwest we've made a little cut out of
the<00:04:13.280> state<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.550> Texas<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.090> we're<00:04:14.720> gonna

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
the state of Texas and we're gonna

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.240 
the state of Texas and we're gonna
overlay<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.989> South<00:04:18.290> by<00:04:18.440> Southwest<00:04:18.680> symbol

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
overlay the South by Southwest symbol

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.910 
overlay the South by Southwest symbol
which<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.520> pretty<00:04:19.730> much<00:04:19.850> an<00:04:20.000> S<00:04:20.180> x<00:04:20.650> SW

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
which is pretty much an S x SW

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.310 
which is pretty much an S x SW
on<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.610> so<00:04:22.820> first<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.690> all<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:23.870> need<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.080> spray

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
on it so first of all we need to spray

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.780 
on it so first of all we need to spray
paint<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:24.710> black<00:04:27.460> we're<00:04:28.460> gonna<00:04:28.550> try<00:04:28.730> two

paint this black we're gonna try two

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.190 
paint this black we're gonna try two
different<00:04:28.940> things<00:04:29.300> we're<00:04:29.480> gonna<00:04:29.600> see<00:04:29.780> how

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
different things we're gonna see how

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.110 
different things we're gonna see how
well<00:04:30.470> by<00:04:31.070> painting<00:04:31.370> with<00:04:31.400> light<00:04:31.520> around<00:04:31.940> these

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
well by painting with light around these

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.150 
well by painting with light around these
edges<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.990> could<00:04:33.140> turn<00:04:33.290> out<00:04:33.440> really<00:04:33.560> cool<00:04:33.860> or

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
edges that could turn out really cool or

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920 
edges that could turn out really cool or
even<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:34.970> cutting<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.300> out<00:04:35.450> all<00:04:35.720> together

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
even just cutting this out all together

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.690 
even just cutting this out all together
and<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.530> filling<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:36.920> whole<00:04:37.100> space<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.520> so

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
and just filling this whole space up so

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.100 
and just filling this whole space up so
a<00:04:37.910> lot<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.270> different<00:04:38.600> ways<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.840> do<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.050> so

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
a lot of different ways to do this so

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.390 
a lot of different ways to do this so
we're<00:04:39.350> just<00:04:39.380> gonna<00:04:39.620> give<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.070> whirl<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.310> see

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
we're just gonna give it a whirl and see

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.870 
we're just gonna give it a whirl and see
what<00:04:40.550> we<00:04:40.640> can<00:04:40.760> do<00:04:41.300> we<00:04:41.420> can<00:04:41.570> do<00:04:41.690> here
