to his uniform typically for the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.750 
to his uniform typically for the
fullback<00:00:29.890> what<00:00:30.460> I<00:00:30.490> always<00:00:30.820> do<00:00:31.330> is<00:00:31.890> swap<00:00:32.890> out<00:00:33.129> to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
fullback what I always do is swap out to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.450

the<00:00:34.059> covered<00:00:34.600> roll<00:00:35.050> bar<00:00:35.379> or<00:00:35.589> covered<00:00:36.010> neck<00:00:36.220> bar

the covered roll bar or covered neck bar

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.850 
the covered roll bar or covered neck bar
I<00:00:36.760> think<00:00:37.269> it<00:00:37.659> really<00:00:37.960> gives<00:00:38.140> them<00:00:38.350> pull<00:00:38.620> back<00:00:38.830> a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.369 
I think it really gives them pull back a
nice<00:00:39.729> tough<00:00:40.120> look<00:00:40.390> as<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.870> can<00:00:41.019> see<00:00:41.170> right

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
also like to use pretty much all the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.750 
also like to use pretty much all the
live<00:01:23.450> accusations<00:01:24.230> exact<00:01:25.010> same<00:01:25.220> method<00:01:25.580> as<00:01:25.700> a

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
live accusations exact same method as a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.940 
live accusations exact same method as a
fullback<00:01:26.090> except<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.780> go<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> linebacker<00:01:27.440> in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
fullback except you go to linebacker in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.950 
fullback except you go to linebacker in
this<00:01:28.310> case<00:01:28.550> what<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:29.000> use<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.510> black

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
this case what we use is the black

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.050 
this case what we use is the black
restrictor<00:01:30.560> which<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.920> kind<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.370> big

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
restrictor which is kind of that big

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.670 
restrictor which is kind of that big
vertical<00:01:32.300> plate<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.960> comes<00:01:33.110> out<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.500> top

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
vertical plate that comes out of the top

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.990 
vertical plate that comes out of the top
of<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.920> jersey<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.490> think<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.760> makes<00:01:34.880> them

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
of the jersey and I think it makes them

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.260 
of the jersey and I think it makes them
look<00:01:35.150> real<00:01:35.360> athletic<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:36.560> really<00:01:37.430> enjoy<00:01:37.670> adding
