00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 Welcome to mtv we present 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 the tech world development 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.830
 Additional control unit for the new 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.650
 top motorization at bmw the m50 diesel 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.890
 installed here in a bmw x6 from the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.090
 year of construction 2012 according to manufacturer the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 vehicle 280 kw 381 hp and 7 140 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 newton meter 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.410
 our initial measurement yielded 2 191 kw 3 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 196 hp and 7 153 newton meters on the clock 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.530
 the thing is of course the absolute 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 hammer and go right forward 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 However, one must say of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.629
 subjective impression is the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.969
 power below 3000 revolutions 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.330
 actually for such a powerful engine 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.979
 but that is relatively disappointing 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.189
 Of course, whining at a very high level 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.990
 because this performance data 20 years ago 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 still sports cars reserved 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 with this engine variant is the montage 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 relatively easy we remove first 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.640
 the mated engine cover and can 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 then the necessary sensors for 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 our techworld chiptuning 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 Additional controller locate first 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 the real pressure sensor here under the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.900
 dawned and right under it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.380
 Metal holder we find the charge pressure 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.890
 sensor raced rocker button, and then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.799
 Pull off plug on ring pressure sensor 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.340
 then we add the corresponding one 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.740
 Plug the tpm csd btb m cable set 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 as always make sure that the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.560
 plug audibly written and stuck 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.009
 of course, the corresponding one 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.780
 connect counterpart 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.659
 then we can plug the plug 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.000
 charge pressure sensor open 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.229
 First, slightly raise the latch 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.090
 then here again the constitution 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.560
 push off the plug 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.920
 by being a bit under 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.660
 sitting as it is a little harder off 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.200
 but it is still possible to come 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.599
 perform well as always here, too 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.700
 Prophylactic note when laying 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.459
 of the cable set make sure that you 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 neither too close to hot sharp-edged 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 or moving parts comes around here 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.780
 we see the tech world tsv 4.2 1 multi 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.970
 core cpu we now with the 25th 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 Pin connector of the cable set 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.700
 we only connect the screws 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.959
 easy on 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.400
 34 turns long completely now 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.600
 following self test is in the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.930
 supplied illustrated 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.459
 assembly instructions described in detail 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.290
 Ignition switch on the red power led 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.480
 permanently shines the yellow and the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.360
 green led blinking about 5 seconds 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.920
 alternately start engine idle 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.440
 give it a short while 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.730
 the green and yellow LEDs show us 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.100
 to that the signals in real time 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.100
 were detected and processed 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.730
 Tagwerk ECU in the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.540
 supplied membrane fabric 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.420
 Pack the protective bag like this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.030
 device laterally between headlights and 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.750
 filler neck of the wiper tank 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.280
 and pay attention 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.380
 that we have a reasonably ordinary one 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.590
 cable history search 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.240
 and as I said not too close to hot 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.790
 sharp-edged or moving parts 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.120
 We'll fix that by then 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.370
 as always with cable ties maybe 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.900
 Here again on the edge of the hint who 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.030
 Fear has that he fingers with shaky 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 Often times w w container 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.230
 The control unit should shake next to it 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.860
 maybe on the other side 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.400
 obstruct 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.030
 there are also some 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.220
 mounting options and the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.720
 Harness is long enough that he both 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:25.000
 on one side and on the other 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:26.950
 side can be designed if everything 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.540
 should be positioned and fixed in 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.960
 every case a visual inspection 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.750
 the installation measures are carried out by the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.840
 high-tech genset not quite adequate 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.900
 m performance plastic lid can now 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.340
 be put back on the engine 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.050
 Make sure that the rubber group 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.890
 engage correctly again 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.729
 so that's not a very sad thing 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.729
 picture supplies 

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:54.979
 Now we can talk about the topic 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.629
 driving pleasure to turn 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.029
 which is despite a very high 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.339
 empty weight of nearly 2 4 tons 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:04.029
 really extreme in this vehicle 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:04.029
 pronounced 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.199
 the wedge is now with his 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.439
 favorite toy the ries logic data 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:33.569
 easy on the journey and we turn 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:36.169
 times the measured facts to the ford 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.169
 lets say hello 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.350
 with our techworld tuning we are 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.740
 now at 317 kw 431 ps 8 137 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.630
 newton meter the influence of 35 ps and 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.210
 480 newton meters of torque 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.370
 despite the high input power ensures 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.540
 our tuning measures for one 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.920
 clearly noticeable improvement 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.280
 dream dancer the series speech solutions 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.750
 here 20 or 30 percent more power 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.880
 should promise , however 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.540
 maybe in the garage castle 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.150
 let's investigate that was another 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.450
 installation video of tape mtv from our 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.660
 Test and Technology Center in Griesheim 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.160
 I thank you for the attention 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.160
 we also come with more videos 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.140
 the start and by no means forgotten 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.850
 just do not subscribe to our channel 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.850
 everything makes clear coaches
