something floating around for a little
while<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> original<00:01:53.310> idea<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
while and the original idea for this

while and the original idea for this
channel<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.860> called

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
channel was going to be called

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
channel was going to be called
versatility<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.600> wanted<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
versatility and what we wanted to do it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.929 
versatility and what we wanted to do it
was<00:01:58.439> originally<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> looks<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.520> Joe's<00:01:59.729> idea

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
was originally it looks like Joe's idea

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929 
was originally it looks like Joe's idea
we<00:02:00.630> would<00:02:00.869> pull<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> leader<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.340> each<00:02:02.579> pub

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
we would pull in a leader from each pub

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
we would pull in a leader from each pub
stomping<00:02:03.450> clan<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.170> take<00:02:04.350> someone<00:02:04.649> from

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
stomping clan so we take someone from

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
stomping clan so we take someone from
doing<00:02:05.070> maybe<00:02:05.250> guys<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.909> take<00:02:06.090> apollo<00:02:06.479> from

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
doing maybe guys would take apollo from

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.449

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
together on a channel

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
together on a channel
that<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.860> basis<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> idea<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.030> we

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that was the basis of the idea so we

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
that was the basis of the idea so we
started<00:02:15.570> up<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> didn't<00:02:16.470> go<00:02:16.590> worried<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
started up and it didn't go worried it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010 
started up and it didn't go worried it
didn't<00:02:17.520> work<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.270> waited<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.660> few<00:02:18.840> months

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
didn't work so we waited a few months

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.900 
didn't work so we waited a few months
until<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.800> advanced<00:02:20.130> warfare<00:02:20.460> come<00:02:20.610> out<00:02:20.730> we

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
until we advanced warfare come out we

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.300 
until we advanced warfare come out we
wanted<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.270> redo<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.810> again<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.100> thought

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

just taken the place so I've got a much

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.030 
just taken the place so I've got a much
more<00:03:00.660> stronger<00:03:01.050> opinion<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> JoJo's

discontent then we're the lucky is with
everything<00:03:04.710> but<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.100> think<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.730> was<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> complete

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
everything but I think it was a complete

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.600 
everything but I think it was a complete
bitch<00:03:06.390> move<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:07.500> why<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:07.740> want<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.430> make

bitch move so that's why we want to make

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.270 
bitch move so that's why we want to make
an<00:03:08.880> entertaining<00:03:09.330> channel<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.860> montage

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
an entertaining channel and a montage

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.860

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
can always switch over to that but

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.200 
can always switch over to that but
anyways<00:05:34.949> I<00:05:35.190> think<00:05:35.639> that's<00:05:35.789> pretty<00:05:35.970> much<00:05:36.150> it

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
anyways I think that's pretty much it

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.689 
anyways I think that's pretty much it
