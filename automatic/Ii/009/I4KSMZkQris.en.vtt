00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.900 
first bouncy one I guess alright so as
you<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.360> here<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:09.990> on<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> trampoline<00:00:10.910> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
you see here we are on a trampoline it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.650 
you see here we are on a trampoline it's
amazing<00:00:13.099> alright<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.670> yeah<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.150> used<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
amazing alright so yeah I used the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.970 
amazing alright so yeah I used the
command<00:00:15.960> block<00:00:16.049> c'mon<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.830> guys

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
command block c'mon for this if you guys

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.240 
command block c'mon for this if you guys
haven't<00:00:17.250> figured<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.580> out<00:00:17.699> yet<00:00:19.100> so<00:00:20.100> now

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
haven't figured that out yet so now

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.320 
haven't figured that out yet so now
let's<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.699> started<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> made<00:00:21.840> this

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
let's get started and how I made this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.620 
let's get started and how I made this
this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.720> only<00:00:25.320> took<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.859> command<00:00:26.220> blocks

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
this is only took two command blocks

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.470 
this is only took two command blocks
surprisingly<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.230> surprising<00:00:28.590> but

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
surprisingly not really surprising but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.939 
surprisingly not really surprising but
it's<00:00:30.480> only<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.140> command<00:00:31.500> block<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
it's only what this command block is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
it's only what this command block is
doing<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.180> less<00:00:33.390> lag<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
doing as you see here less lag because I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
doing as you see here less lag because I
fix<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> lag<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.829> made<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.059> mod<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.570> stable

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
fix the lag and made the mod more stable

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.069 
fix the lag and made the mod more stable
on<00:00:37.050> worlds<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.190> ok<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> command

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
on worlds but ok so what this command

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
on worlds but ok so what this command
block<00:00:43.260> does<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.070> looper<00:00:44.520> does<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
block does what this looper does to this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
block does what this looper does to this
command<00:00:45.390> block<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.960> loops<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.800> command

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
command block is it loops this command

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.720 
command block is it loops this command
block<00:00:47.690> over<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.719> over<00:00:49.079> testing<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
block over and over testing for if the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.189 
block over and over testing for if the
player<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> within<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.960> two-block<00:00:52.680> radius<00:00:54.199> on

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
player is within a two-block radius on

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.910 
player is within a two-block radius on
the<00:00:56.190> x-axis<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.180> two-block<00:00:58.020> radius<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.829> the

the x-axis a two-block radius on the
z-axis<00:00:59.449> NF<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.500> between<00:01:01.649> five<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
z-axis NF and if it's between five and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.020 
z-axis NF and if it's between five and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
four blocks on the y-axis that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
four blocks on the y-axis that
technically<00:01:06.390> means<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> jump<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.010> only<00:01:08.310> if

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
technically means if you jump so only if

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.450 
technically means if you jump so only if
you<00:01:08.610> jump<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.540> usually<00:01:09.810> some

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
you jump that this will do usually some

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
you jump that this will do usually some
some<00:01:11.460> command<00:01:12.119> block<00:01:12.299> mods<00:01:12.570> usually<00:01:13.200> like

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
some command block mods usually like

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
some command block mods usually like
make<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.030> mean<00:01:15.710> some<00:01:16.759> trampoline<00:01:17.759> mods

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
make it so I mean some trampoline mods

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
make it so I mean some trampoline mods
make<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> tell<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.310> once<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.729> onto<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
make it tell you once you get onto that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
make it tell you once you get onto that
certain<00:01:21.540> position<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.080> launches<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.680> but

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
certain position it launches you up but

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
certain position it launches you up but
this<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.939> tests<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.630> you're<00:01:24.990> jumping<00:01:25.680> or

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this one only tests if you're jumping or

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.480 
this one only tests if you're jumping or
if<00:01:26.280> you've<00:01:26.490> jumped<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:29.280> right

here and you just keep jumping until you
get<00:01:31.290> off<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> trampoline<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.340> can

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
get off of the trampoline I can
