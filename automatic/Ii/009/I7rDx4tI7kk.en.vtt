00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.910 
recommend to switch the parallax effect
off<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:48.149> parallax<00:01:48.659> effect<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.409> motion

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
off the parallax effect is this motion

that<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.420> slide<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that you can see here the slide to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.830 
that you can see here the slide to
unlock<00:01:52.020> slider<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> bottom<00:01:53.610> bar<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.420> text

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
kind of floats up and down because what

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
kind of floats up and down because what
we<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.590> add<00:01:58.770> these<00:01:58.979> designs<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.729> your

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
we do is we add these designs to your

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.139 
we do is we add these designs to your
background<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.200> you've<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.250> motion

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
background so if you've got the motion

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.950 
background so if you've got the motion
for<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.570> background<00:02:04.110> enabled<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
for the background enabled you have the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
for the background enabled you have the
effect<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.979> text<00:02:08.399> floats<00:02:08.789> inside<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
effect that the text floats inside of

effect that the text floats inside of
this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.160 
this
defined<00:02:11.200> area<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.099> made<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.790> do<00:02:13.330> further

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
defined area that we made to do further

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.380

slide to unlock slide at you for example

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.479 
slide to unlock slide at you for example
and<00:02:16.569> many<00:02:17.290> people<00:02:17.530> find<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.130> little<00:02:18.220> bit

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and many people find this a little bit

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.240 
and many people find this a little bit
irritating<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.569> not<00:02:20.020> really<00:02:20.530> fixed

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
irritating that it's not really fixed

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.610 
irritating that it's not really fixed
but<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.819> floating<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.450> top<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
but that it's floating on top if you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.440 
but that it's floating on top if you
like<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.640> course<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.270> use

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
like it like that of course you can use

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.880 
like it like that of course you can use
it<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.870> think<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.739> better

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it like that but we think it's a better

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.949 
it like that but we think it's a better
effect<00:02:30.130> even<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.030> switch<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.510> parallax

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
effect even if you switch the parallax

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.059 
effect even if you switch the parallax
effect<00:02:32.319> off<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.489> do<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.800> go<00:02:36.040> into

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
effect off so to do that you go into

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.410 
effect off so to do that you go into
your<00:02:36.640> settings<00:02:36.940> app<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.060> go<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.680> general

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
your settings app and you go to general

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.690 
your settings app and you go to general
accessibility<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:46.090> there's<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.700> here

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
accessibility and then there's a here

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.550 
accessibility and then there's a here
there's<00:02:49.000> an<00:02:49.180> option<00:02:49.600> called<00:02:49.630> reduce<00:02:50.290> motion

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
there's an option called reduce motion

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.509 
there's an option called reduce motion
you<00:02:51.519> go<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.850> there<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.160> little<00:02:54.400> bit

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
you go in there and it's a little bit

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.890 
you go in there and it's a little bit
hard<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.880> understand<00:02:55.330> but<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.569> have<00:02:55.750> to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
hard to understand but you have to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.009 
hard to understand but you have to
switch<00:02:56.230> reduce<00:02:57.069> motion<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.760> because<00:02:58.239> then<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
switch reduce motion on because then the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.130 
switch reduce motion on because then the
motion<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.950> reduced<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:01.599> more<00:03:01.780> precise

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
motion is reduced to be more precise

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.199 
motion is reduced to be more precise
it's<00:03:02.500> completely<00:03:03.190> turned<00:03:03.489> off<00:03:03.640> for<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.060> lock

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
it's completely turned off for the lock

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.600 
it's completely turned off for the lock
screen<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.349> this<00:03:05.470> case<00:03:05.769> when<00:03:06.340> you've

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
screen so in this case when you've

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.120 
screen so in this case when you've
installed<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.480> lock<00:03:07.630> screen<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:08.140> week<00:03:08.349> we've

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
installed a lock screen like week we've

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
installed a lock screen like week we've
done<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:09.700> can<00:03:09.880> see<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.299> fits<00:03:10.510> perfectly

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
done it you can see it fits perfectly

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.009 
done it you can see it fits perfectly
and<00:03:11.400> there's<00:03:12.400> no<00:03:12.640> floating<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.510> tech<00:03:13.810> of

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and there's no floating on the tech of

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.590 
and there's no floating on the tech of
the<00:03:14.170> text<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.769> top<00:03:15.549> of<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> slider<00:03:16.120> anymore

again<00:03:47.519> we<00:03:48.519> will<00:03:48.700> save<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.269> little<00:03:49.450> bit

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
again we will save it a little bit

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.289 
again we will save it a little bit
differently<00:03:50.170> in<00:03:50.440> this<00:03:50.620> case<00:03:51.100> if<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.639> parallax

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
differently in this case if you parallax

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.910 
differently in this case if you parallax
motion<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.019> switched<00:03:53.410> off<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.680> will

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
motion is switched off and so you will

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.280 
motion is switched off and so you will
need<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.160> have<00:03:57.370> save<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.060> again<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.840> see<00:03:59.049> now
