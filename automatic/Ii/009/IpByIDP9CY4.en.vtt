00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
really captured my imagination about

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
really captured my imagination about
your<00:01:12.060> work<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.170> idea

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
your work was this you know this idea

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
your work was this you know this idea
you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.040> using<00:01:14.369> our<00:01:14.670> brains<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.479> talk

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you know using our brains to talk

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
you know using our brains to talk
directly<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.290> machines<00:01:16.890> absolutely<00:01:17.820> because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
directly to machines absolutely because

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.359 
directly to machines absolutely because
up<00:01:18.390> until<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:18.720> all<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.530> our<00:01:19.740> communication

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
up until now all of our communication

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
up until now all of our communication
with<00:01:20.520> machines<00:01:20.939> has<00:01:21.150> been<00:01:21.330> limited<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.840> very

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with machines has been limited to very

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
with machines has been limited to very
conscious<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:22.890> explicit<00:01:23.430> forms<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.939> know

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
conscious or explicit forms you know

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
conscious or explicit forms you know
whether<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.229> simple<00:01:25.530> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
whether it's something simple like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
whether it's something simple like
turning<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> light<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> switch<00:01:27.180> or

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
turning on the light with a switch or

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
turning on the light with a switch or
even<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.110> complex<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.710> programming<00:01:29.220> software

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
even as complex as programming software

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
even as complex as programming software
we've<00:01:30.180> always<00:01:30.450> had<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> give<00:01:31.110> machines

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
we've always had to give machines

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 
we've always had to give machines
command<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> perform<00:01:33.390> any<00:01:33.689> function

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
command for it to perform any function

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.980 
command for it to perform any function
for<00:01:34.530> us<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.360> limits<00:01:36.780> our

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
for us and really that limits our

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.700 
for us and really that limits our
ability<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.770> navigate<00:01:38.490> through<00:01:39.030> masses<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
ability to navigate through masses of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
ability to navigate through masses of
information<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:42.450> our

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
information that we have now at our

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
information that we have now at our
disposal<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.979> information<00:01:44.549> overload

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
disposal and this information overload

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
disposal and this information overload
is<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.420> becoming<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.049> more

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is actually becoming more and more

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.370 
is actually becoming more and more
complex<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:47.549> time<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
complex over time so you know on the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
complex over time so you know on the
other<00:01:49.500> hand<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.009> look<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:50.310> communication

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
other hand you look at communication

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
other hand you look at communication
between<00:01:51.060> us<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.659> humans<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
between us as humans it's actually so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
between us as humans it's actually so
much<00:01:53.159> more<00:01:53.369> compelling<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.689> take

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
much more compelling because we take

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.690 
much more compelling because we take
into<00:01:55.140> account<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.770> much<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.250> than<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
into account so much more than what is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
into account so much more than what is
explicitly<00:01:57.360> expressed<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.140> sort<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.469> body

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.789 
explicitly expressed right sort of body
language<00:01:59.360> facial<00:02:00.360> expressions<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.469> observe

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
language facial expressions we observe

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that we observe body language and then

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
that we observe body language and then
from<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.469> start<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.920> infer<00:02:05.280> feelings

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
from that we can start to infer feelings

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.750 
from that we can start to infer feelings
and<00:02:06.060> emotions<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:07.140> our<00:02:07.259> dialogue

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
and emotions into our dialogue

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.370 
and emotions into our dialogue
with<00:02:07.850> each<00:02:07.970> other<00:02:08.210> this<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:08.990> something<00:02:09.260> that

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
with each other this is something that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.590 
with each other this is something that
doesn't<00:02:09.680> exist<00:02:09.770> today<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:10.610> our<00:02:10.970> communication

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
doesn't exist today in our communication

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.750 
doesn't exist today in our communication
with<00:02:11.720> machines<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.740> at<00:02:12.860> emotive<00:02:13.250> our<00:02:13.400> vision

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
with machines so at emotive our vision

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.510 
with machines so at emotive our vision
for<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> future<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:15.520> communication

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
for the future is that communication

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.780 
for the future is that communication
with<00:02:16.730> computing<00:02:17.660> has<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.170> involve<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.860> total

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
with computing has to involve a total

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
with computing has to involve a total
form<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.060> communication<00:02:20.510> where<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.050> starts<00:02:21.590> to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
form of communication where it starts to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.200 
form of communication where it starts to
understand<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.280> interpret<00:02:22.580> your<00:02:22.790> facial

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
understand and interpret your facial

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.600 
understand and interpret your facial
expressions<00:02:23.720> your<00:02:24.200> emotions<00:02:24.740> as<00:02:24.950> well<00:02:24.980> okay

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
expressions your emotions as well okay

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.800 
expressions your emotions as well okay
now<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> lot<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.060> people<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.450> talked<00:02:26.630> about

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
now a lot of people have talked about

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960 
now a lot of people have talked about
using<00:02:27.260> computer<00:02:27.680> vision<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.610> but

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
using computer vision to do that but

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.610 
using computer vision to do that but
you're<00:02:29.390> taking<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.780> different<00:02:29.930> approach<00:02:30.110> we're

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
you're taking a different approach we're

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.100 
you're taking a different approach we're
taking<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:31.040> different<00:02:31.190> approach<00:02:31.400> we're<00:02:31.910> taking

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
taking a different approach we're taking

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.810 
taking a different approach we're taking
signals<00:02:33.110> directly<00:02:33.470> from<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.800> brain<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.580> we're

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
signals directly from the brain so we're

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.090 
signals directly from the brain so we're
naturally<00:02:35.030> emitting<00:02:35.620> electrical<00:02:36.620> signals<00:02:36.980> as

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
naturally emitting electrical signals as

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.650 
naturally emitting electrical signals as
we're<00:02:37.280> standing<00:02:37.490> here<00:02:37.850> we're<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.300> taking

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
we're standing here we're just taking

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.480 
we're standing here we're just taking
sensors<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.290> measure<00:02:39.890> those<00:02:40.190> fluctuations

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
sensors that measure those fluctuations

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.880 
sensors that measure those fluctuations
at<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> surface<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.810> scalp<00:02:42.080> totally

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
at the surface of the scalp totally

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.040 
at the surface of the scalp totally
non-invasive<00:02:43.040> technology<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.750> then

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
non-invasive technology and then

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.410 
non-invasive technology and then
basically<00:02:45.700> determine<00:02:46.700> what<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.300> you

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
basically determine what it is that you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.720 
basically determine what it is that you
go<00:02:47.720> take<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.960> look<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.260> ya<00:02:48.380> all<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.160> let's<00:02:49.520> do

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
go take a look at ya all right let's do

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.850 
go take a look at ya all right let's do
that<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:52.550> um<00:02:52.910> I'll<00:02:53.270> introduce<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.200> Zachary

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
that so um I'll introduce you to Zachary

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.190 
that so um I'll introduce you to Zachary
try<00:02:55.130> Zach<00:02:55.990> welcome<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.080> IDF<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:59.209> here<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.990> the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
try Zach welcome to IDF so here is the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.350 
try Zach welcome to IDF so here is the
first<00:03:00.410> interaction<00:03:01.160> point<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.910> see

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
first interaction point and what you see

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.140 
first interaction point and what you see
here<00:03:02.570> on<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.750> screen<00:03:02.870> are<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:04.400> know<00:03:04.520> spirit

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
here on the screen are you know spirit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.080 
here on the screen are you know spirit
wists<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.840> what<00:03:06.740> they<00:03:06.920> generally<00:03:07.640> do<00:03:07.820> in<00:03:08.000> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
wists and what they generally do in a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.630 
wists and what they generally do in a
normal<00:03:08.240> game<00:03:08.660> paradigm<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.800> know<00:03:09.920> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
normal game paradigm is you know you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.580 
normal game paradigm is you know you
would<00:03:10.850> press<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> combination<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.380> buttons

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
would press a combination of buttons

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.370 
would press a combination of buttons
before<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:13.940> oh<00:03:14.360> he's<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:15.080> some

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
before you do that oh he's got some

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.620 
before you do that oh he's got some
thing<00:03:15.980> on<00:03:16.220> his<00:03:16.370> head<00:03:16.400> that's<00:03:16.850> right<00:03:17.209> he<00:03:17.450> has

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
thing on his head that's right he has

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.479 
thing on his head that's right he has
the<00:03:17.870> headset<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.470> his<00:03:18.620> head<00:03:18.890> which<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.130> picking

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
the headset on his head which is picking

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.970 
the headset on his head which is picking
up<00:03:19.959> electrical<00:03:20.959> signals<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.470> measures<00:03:21.890> at

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
up electrical signals that measures at

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.490 
up electrical signals that measures at
the<00:03:22.100> surface<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.300> exact<00:03:23.660> actually<00:03:24.080> directly

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
the surface so exact actually directly

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.880 
the surface so exact actually directly
coupling<00:03:25.040> his<00:03:25.310> brain<00:03:25.940> activity<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.530> end

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
coupling his brain activity in the end

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.620 
coupling his brain activity in the end
of<00:03:28.070> this<00:03:28.160> computer<00:03:28.610> that's<00:03:28.790> right<00:03:29.030> wirelessly

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
of this computer that's right wirelessly

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.620 
of this computer that's right wirelessly
transmits<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.530> signal<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.850> USB<00:03:32.239> daughter

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
transmits the signal to a USB daughter

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.180 
transmits the signal to a USB daughter
out<00:03:33.130> it's<00:03:34.130> pretty<00:03:34.310> wild<00:03:35.260> okay<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.320> Zach<00:03:36.769> if<00:03:37.040> you

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
out it's pretty wild okay so Zach if you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.120 
out it's pretty wild okay so Zach if you
get<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.880> interaction<00:03:38.570> point<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.920> here

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
get to the interaction point and so here

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.600 
get to the interaction point and so here
he<00:03:40.430> can<00:03:40.580> just<00:03:40.820> simply<00:03:41.390> make<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.110> scary<00:03:42.500> face<00:03:42.800> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
he can just simply make a scary face and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.090 
he can just simply make a scary face and
scare<00:03:44.540> up<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.930> spirits<00:03:45.290> away<00:03:45.500> instead<00:03:45.980> of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
scare up the spirits away instead of

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.979 
scare up the spirits away instead of
having<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.459> it's<00:03:46.940> very<00:03:47.120> intuitive<00:03:47.540> very

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
having to it's very intuitive very

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.740 
having to it's very intuitive very
natural<00:03:48.470> nothing<00:03:48.769> he<00:03:48.860> has<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.250> learn<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.750> what

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
natural nothing he has to learn and what

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.630 
natural nothing he has to learn and what
you<00:03:50.900> can<00:03:51.050> also<00:03:51.200> notice<00:03:51.500> also<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:52.280> color

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
you can also notice also is this color

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.820 
you can also notice also is this color
of<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.910> sky<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.209> color<00:03:53.900> palette<00:03:54.230> actually

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
of the sky the color palette actually

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.190 
of the sky the color palette actually
reflects<00:03:55.220> his<00:03:55.400> mood<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.269> as<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:57.050> walking

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
reflects his mood so as we're walking

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.100 
reflects his mood so as we're walking
through<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.950> demo<00:03:58.310> when<00:03:59.090> home<00:03:59.239> oh<00:03:59.360> yeah<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
through this demo when home oh yeah the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.570 
through this demo when home oh yeah the
background<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.709> changing<00:04:01.130> color<00:04:01.340> that's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
background is changing color that's

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.270 
background is changing color that's
right<00:04:02.140> well<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.260> really<00:04:03.470> have<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.739> want<00:04:04.190> to

right well you really have to want to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.479 
right well you really have to want to
share<00:04:04.459> your<00:04:04.640> thoughts<00:04:04.880> with<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.150> world<00:04:05.269> here

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
share your thoughts with the world here

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.460 
share your thoughts with the world here
absolutely<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.180> here<00:04:08.480> he's<00:04:08.900> holding<00:04:09.260> us

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
absolutely so here he's holding us

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.150 
absolutely so here he's holding us
actually<00:04:10.400> moving<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.780> rock<00:04:12.140> with<00:04:12.680> the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
actually moving the rock with the

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.160 
actually moving the rock with the
thought<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.610> lifting<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.390> once<00:04:14.930> he's

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
thought of lifting it and once he's

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.650 
thought of lifting it and once he's
lifted<00:04:15.859> there's<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> forest<00:04:16.670> back

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
lifted there's the forest back

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.400 
lifted there's the forest back
force<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.230> can<00:04:18.410> actually<00:04:18.650> walk<00:04:19.519> across<00:04:19.820> and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
force you can actually walk across and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.350 
force you can actually walk across and
apply<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.680> lift<00:04:21.950> action<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:23.060> other

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
apply that lift action to other

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.530 
apply that lift action to other
obstacles<00:04:24.170> in<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.130> game<00:04:25.310> as<00:04:25.580> well<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.120> here

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
obstacles in the game as well so here

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.280 
obstacles in the game as well so here
he's<00:04:27.260> come<00:04:27.950> up<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> bridge<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.290> what

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
he's come up to the bridge and what

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.650 
he's come up to the bridge and what
he'll<00:04:30.470> need<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.310> maintain<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.390> thought

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
he'll need to do is maintain the thought

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.380 
he'll need to do is maintain the thought
of<00:04:32.690> lift<00:04:33.110> over<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> longer<00:04:34.160> period<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.670> time<00:04:34.730> in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
of lift over a longer period of time in

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.190 
of lift over a longer period of time in
order<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.960> trigger<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.530> action<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
order to trigger that action and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.110 
order to trigger that action and
hopefully<00:04:39.200> repair<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.770> bridge<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.640> allow<00:04:40.880> him

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
hopefully repair the bridge to allow him

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.100 
hopefully repair the bridge to allow him
to<00:04:41.240> walk<00:04:41.420> across<00:04:41.740> focus<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:43.660> may<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.810> force

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
to walk across focus that may the force

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:59.980 
to walk across focus that may the force
be<00:04:45.230> with<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:51.970> not<00:04:52.970> quite<00:04:53.240> there<00:04:58.720> well<00:04:59.720> this<00:04:59.870> is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
what happens when you're at the bleeding

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.540 
what happens when you're at the bleeding
edge<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.610> technology<00:05:02.860> I've<00:05:03.860> seen<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.340> word

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
edge of technology I've seen this word

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:16.120 
edge of technology I've seen this word
oh<00:05:07.930> come<00:05:08.930> on<00:05:09.080> yes<00:05:10.720> yes<00:05:12.760> all<00:05:13.760> right
