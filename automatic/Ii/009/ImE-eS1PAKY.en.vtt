00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.340
 do not 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.250
 in summer it is usual for them to premiere 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.920
 some movies that maybe in another 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.750
 time of year because we would not see maybe 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.910
 because the heat softens us maybe 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.529
 because we become less demanding or 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.950
 simply because we have little where 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.849
 to choose 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.759
 we just gave them a chance this 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.829
 it also applies to video games 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.899
 right to help retribution is one of 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.790
 these cases a game that could have 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.700
 given a lot of himself but that only outlines 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.250
 your ideas without getting any 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 port a very loose story a 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.640
 badly polished gameplay a control 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.220
 defective and a graphic section 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.930
 pretty loose are just the tip of the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.140
 iceberg of everything we will find 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.100
 in this game after the end of the war 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.470
 of vietnam chick with walt returns home 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.690
 this retired soldier is now looking for a 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.780
 quiet life but the problems do not 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.030
 it will take them to find you these seem 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.100
 have a relationship with his father toledo 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.950
 with wayne and hate that the devils hand 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.409
 they feel towards their whole family 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.630
 a nasty chance encounter with 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.299
 one of them will cause jake 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.240
 start your thirst for revenge and therefore of 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.710
 start the game by the way we will go 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.810
 eliminating each of the main 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.670
 mandates to which 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.549
 we could consider as final heads 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.729
 phase closer to the last 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.740
 of all the maximum responsible sections 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 arcade in which we will control our 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.880
 motorbikes are interspersed with sections of 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.729
 action on foot using both guns 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.959
 as our own points 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.610
 both make up the spine 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:51.540
 of the game and both seem unfinished 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.160
 repetitive deficient 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.320
 in the motorized sections 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.750
 we will control a motorcycle that seems to weigh 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.670
 little that is difficult to drive by 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.290
 the poor control that although it 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.470
 crash against any object not 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.180
 suffers damage or fall off the bike's sic 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 use the ramps to perform jumps 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.110
 Nor we do much and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.960
 nor of doing the horse with the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.910
 motorbikes should give us points but in the 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.400
 motorcycle will almost always be embedded 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 some part of the scenario in certain 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 points of the layout we are forced to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.400
 slide the motorcycle to go under 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
 of the danger but it must be done in the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.090
 thousandth of a second correct because the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.800
 margin to do it is so bad 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.830
 defined that is probably not what 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.110
 let's perform these actions correctly 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.750
 they get even more complicated when they attack us 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.520
 motorized enemies when they approach 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.320
 we can support the button 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 indicated to perform savage actions 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.959
 we can also shoot the bikers 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.599
 the actions on foot are based on going 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.030
 eliminating enemies terribly 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.709
 oaks are using the different 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.319
 guns guns with greater 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.480
 effectiveness that the shotguns themselves or 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.280
 the melee attacks we will have 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.459
 in front of our enemies who are waiting 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.620
 be killed a fair duck moves 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.630
 much more than them presenting alone 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.540
 something more opposition in the fighting 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.459
 melee in front of the shootings in 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.790
 those who stay still firing 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.410
 almost without ceasing and without recharging many of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.819
 enemies at death will leave us 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.000
 money ammo 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.530
 and we can sell the drug to the drug 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.420
 which means of shift to get more 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.700
 money what evidence one of the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.459
 many ideas put to the force and little 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.069
 worked there will be many females that 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.130
 will cross our path helping 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.400
 many of them will reward us in 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.230
 species offering sexual scenes 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.489
 totally expendable 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 as we move forward in the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.010
 history we will unlock new 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.350
 areas 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.360
 outlining just one purpose sandbox that 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.700
 it stays in water of borage 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.640
 it's not a linear game but neither is there 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.340
 an open world proper is a 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.290
 intermediate we can select go to a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.870
 point or another but with play areas 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.430
 sold out with invisible barriers and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.100
 many useless sets that do not 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.630
 let us be explored we can go 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.940
 buying new or new weapons 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.040
 movements in the army vans 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.880
 as well as collecting the different 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.670
 technically hidden cards let 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.040
 wish with ugly scenarios and more 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.810
 recreated visual effects that look 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.750
 of the previous generation and physical 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.650
 non-existent relationships are 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.850
 repetitive crude gross robotic 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.470
 even the special movements that 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.950
 we perform by unleashing our fury 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.440
 they end up bothering in the gameplay like 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.600
 colophon the soundtrack is repetitive 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.550
 based mainly on repetition 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 ad nauseam of the same subject 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.810
 principal to which you have added only 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.660
 some more so that they are not 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.490
 monothematic but not very lucky 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.410
 the about 10 hours of play that 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.800
 offers are made even long to 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.160
 Repeat excessively the same scheme 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.380
 neither do the excessive loads help 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.770
 right to help retribution is wrong 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.770
 game
