hoop and what you want to do is hoop in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.880 
hoop and what you want to do is hoop in
each<00:01:13.539> combination<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.470> can<00:01:14.590> have<00:01:14.740> those

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
each combination that you can have those

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.670 
each combination that you can have those
two<00:01:15.130> loops<00:01:15.399> so<00:01:16.000> for<00:01:16.149> example<00:01:16.539> practice<00:01:17.350> at<00:01:17.500> the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
time and try to go through every single

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.500 
time and try to go through every single
potential<00:01:33.400> combination<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.119> those<00:01:34.270> two

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
potential combination that those two

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.530 
potential combination that those two
hoops<00:01:34.720> could<00:01:35.020> be<00:01:35.140> hooked<00:01:35.439> on<00:01:35.650> your<00:01:35.740> body<00:01:36.540> next

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
hoops could be hooked on your body next

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.539 
hoops could be hooked on your body next
when<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.080> add<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.409> third<00:01:38.590> hoop<00:01:38.799> do<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.280> exact

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
when you add the third hoop do the exact

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.310 
when you add the third hoop do the exact
same<00:01:39.729> thing<00:01:40.000> go<00:01:40.150> through<00:01:40.180> every<00:01:40.810> potential

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
same thing go through every potential

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.740 
same thing go through every potential
combination<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.100> there<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.540> that's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
combination that there is so that's

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.630 
combination that there is so that's
what's<00:01:44.470> gonna<00:01:44.590> happen<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.040> doing<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.400> is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
what's gonna happen in doing that is

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.330 
what's gonna happen in doing that is
what<00:01:46.509> I'm<00:01:46.600> hoping<00:01:46.720> at<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.080> knees<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:48.189> have

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
what I'm hoping at the knees and I have

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
what I'm hoping at the knees and I have
a<00:01:48.369> hoop<00:01:48.610> at<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.790> waist<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:50.290> waist<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:51.360> reacting

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
a hoop at the waist my waist is reacting

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.469 
a hoop at the waist my waist is reacting
because<00:01:53.290> I'm<00:01:53.619> moving<00:01:53.890> my<00:01:53.979> knees<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.150> can't

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
because I'm moving my knees so I can't

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.359 
because I'm moving my knees so I can't
move<00:01:56.200> exactly<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> same<00:01:57.070> way<00:01:57.189> I<00:01:57.220> would

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
move exactly the same way I would

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.550 
move exactly the same way I would
normally<00:01:57.520> hoop<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> waist<00:01:58.270> there's<00:01:58.900> an

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
normally hoop at the waist there's an

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.590 
normally hoop at the waist there's an
impact<00:02:00.340> from<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.759> fact<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.060> then<00:02:01.270> my<00:02:01.420> knees

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
impact from the fact that then my knees

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.359 
impact from the fact that then my knees
are<00:02:01.720> also<00:02:01.869> moving<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.710> what<00:02:02.829> happens<00:02:03.159> in

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
are also moving so what happens in

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:03.820 
are also moving so what happens in
practice

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
practice

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.800 
practice
combination<00:02:04.550> as<00:02:04.700> your<00:02:04.850> body<00:02:05.030> starts<00:02:05.720> to

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
combination as your body starts to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.030 
combination as your body starts to
understand<00:02:06.550> what's<00:02:07.550> gonna<00:02:07.760> happen<00:02:08.530> what<00:02:09.530> what

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
understand what's gonna happen what what

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.100 
understand what's gonna happen what what
variations<00:02:10.729> there<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:10.970> that<00:02:11.630> are<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.870> on

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
variations there are that are going on

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.190 
variations there are that are going on
because<00:02:12.970> if<00:02:13.970> you're<00:02:14.390> being<00:02:14.510> influenced<00:02:15.050> by

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
because if you're being influenced by

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
because if you're being influenced by
other<00:02:15.380> sections<00:02:15.860> other<00:02:16.610> sections<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.210> your

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
other sections other sections of your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.500 
other sections other sections of your
body<00:02:17.540> are<00:02:17.720> being<00:02:17.930> influenced<00:02:18.350> by<00:02:18.410> other<00:02:19.130> coops

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
body are being influenced by other coops

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.510 
body are being influenced by other coops
so<00:02:20.510> try<00:02:21.050> each<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.470> those<00:02:21.530> combinations<00:02:21.890> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
so try each of those combinations and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.940 
so try each of those combinations and
just<00:02:22.940> experiment<00:02:23.270> with<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.720> some<00:02:24.230> ideas<00:02:24.590> for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
just experiment with it some ideas for

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.660 
just experiment with it some ideas for
starting<00:02:25.550> out<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.900> find<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.620> hardest<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
starting out I find the hardest way to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.640 
starting out I find the hardest way to
start<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.510> put<00:02:29.690> all<00:02:29.960> four<00:02:30.200> groups<00:02:30.380> on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
start up is to put all four groups on

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890 
start up is to put all four groups on
your<00:02:30.890> waist<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:31.940> try<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.180> separate<00:02:32.690> them

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
your waist and then try to separate them

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440 
your waist and then try to separate them
it's<00:02:33.740> easy<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.100> pick<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.490> up<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.240> try<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
it's easy to pick one up but to try to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.320 
it's easy to pick one up but to try to
get<00:02:35.630> one<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.930> drop<00:02:36.170> down<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.410> your<00:02:36.590> knees

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
get one to drop down to your knees

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.910 
get one to drop down to your knees
somewhere<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.080> bit<00:02:39.200> tricky<00:02:39.410> so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
somewhere that's a little bit tricky so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320 
somewhere that's a little bit tricky so
that's<00:02:40.100> probably<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.460> hardest<00:02:40.520> way<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.210> it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
that's probably the hardest way to do it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.250 
that's probably the hardest way to do it
another<00:02:41.600> way<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.200> rip<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.160> four<00:02:43.430> hoops<00:02:43.700> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
another way is to rip off four hoops and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860 
another way is to rip off four hoops and
toss<00:02:45.260> one<00:02:45.590> onto<00:02:45.830> your<00:02:45.950> knees<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:47.000> toss

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
toss one onto your knees and then toss

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.560 
toss one onto your knees and then toss
two<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.740> your<00:02:48.860> chest<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.490> grab<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.300> top<00:02:50.540> one

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
two on your chest and grab the top one

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.870 
two on your chest and grab the top one
and<00:02:51.170> bring<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.500> one<00:02:51.650> up<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.370> 200<00:02:52.700> chest

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
and bring that one up and the 200 chest

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.090 
and bring that one up and the 200 chest
will<00:02:53.030> suck<00:02:53.240> usually<00:02:54.110> separate<00:02:54.500> fairly<00:02:54.980> easily

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
will suck usually separate fairly easily

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.820 
will suck usually separate fairly easily
and<00:02:55.400> then<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.330> last<00:02:56.510> way<00:02:56.780> which<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.410> really

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and then the last way which is really

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.740 
and then the last way which is really
great<00:02:57.980> for<00:02:58.090> performances<00:02:59.090> because<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.570> can

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
great for performances because you can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.900 
great for performances because you can
gradually<00:03:00.080> add<00:03:00.320> one<00:03:00.530> point<00:03:00.709> at<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:00.890> time<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:01.640> you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
gradually add one point at a time if you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.510 
gradually add one point at a time if you
know<00:03:02.480> how<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.690> do<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.200> foot<00:03:03.620> pop<00:03:03.830> up<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
know how to do the foot pop up so the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.490 
know how to do the foot pop up so the
hoops<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.940> floor<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.300> pick<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.570> up<00:03:05.750> with

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
hoops on the floor and pick it up with

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.110 
hoops on the floor and pick it up with
your<00:03:06.650> foot<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.640> skipping

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
your foot in that kind of skipping

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780 
your foot in that kind of skipping
motion<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.800> can<00:03:09.950> gradually<00:03:10.190> add<00:03:10.550> one

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
motion then you can gradually add one

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.699 
motion then you can gradually add one
hoop<00:03:10.940> at<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> time<00:03:11.300> pulling<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.350> from<00:03:12.560> your

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
hoop at a time pulling it up from your

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.380 
hoop at a time pulling it up from your
to<00:03:13.280> your<00:03:13.400> knees<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.580> bring<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> move<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
to your knees and bring the move all the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.850 
to your knees and bring the move all the
way<00:03:14.420> up<00:03:14.540> your<00:03:14.660> hand<00:03:14.900> pick<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.560> another<00:03:15.769> one

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
way up your hand pick up another one

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.229 
way up your hand pick up another one
bring<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.280> up<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.430> your<00:03:16.550> chest<00:03:16.820> pick<00:03:17.150> up

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
bring it up to your chest pick up

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.729 
bring it up to your chest pick up
another<00:03:17.480> one<00:03:17.660> bring<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.140> waste<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.650> then

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
another one bring it to waste and then

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.680 
another one bring it to waste and then
pick<00:03:18.890> up

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
pick up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.070 
pick up
so<00:03:21.690> those<00:03:21.840> are<00:03:21.960> my<00:03:22.020> tips<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.500> hope<00:03:22.740> they<00:03:22.920> help
