00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.660
 video guide on the mascots then we 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.019
 let's see how to beat the mind 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 hangers she murmurs in version 2 in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 this version we will use a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.030
 only fart so who is the proto dragone 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.500
 emerald 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.000
 in short grandpa like that he'll be able 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 to hit harder and that he is stronger 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 and we're going to be able to flap two 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.359
 other mascots that have to be 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 minimum level 10 since they will 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 take damage against the first 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 done when we're going to get them back then 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.309
 we start with the mascots 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.350
 to be able to shutters so the first 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.790
 mascot must always make a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.829
 technical my broom the sleepy so these 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 taken into account if you wanted 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.180
 directly will not be taken into account 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:50.570
 So here I go again the first time 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.570
 mascot 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.699
 that's how I'm sure she is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.699
 taken into account 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 and now we start you see 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440
 all these techniques are weak 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440
 against us 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.840
 and this is the case of all 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.810
 mascots all the techniques will be 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.650
 weak against the proto whelp good 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.120
 Well, it starts well 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.120
 we put a style 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 so it's a time that the fight goes 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.910
 to be a little long do not need 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.980
 hesitate to you it is as soon as you 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.980
 can not take a chance 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 so there actually he used this 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.300
 technical strikes cocoon so we get it 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.950
 and hop there the second fart so the same 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:20.980
 case of the techniques made against you 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.980
 you got stronger up until 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.510
 we still lost a lot of pv so 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.510
 we will use the emerald dream 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.819
 so it's without retransforming to life 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.819
 or almost 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.760
 so the up emule and ancient diction on 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.790
 is not lucky it's touched three 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.790
 time 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.750
 we will let go now the last 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.780
 pet who is so the spirit of the erp in 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.890
 arena it will start with the he we 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.260
 wants to use the emerald dream 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.260
 we will recover from the pv 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.270
 plus my little critic so here we 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270
 continues to settle 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.599
 so here we put their worlds again 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.689
 two critics 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.509
 we put ourselves a little there 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.900
 and normally now we have enough of 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.900
 pay to go to the end 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.580
 we can without end by a critic is 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.830
 with a single fart we beat and the spirit 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.940
 from erp to arena and we have more to see 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.440
 the shutters two other mascots 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.440
 see you soon for a new guide
