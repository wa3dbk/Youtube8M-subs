00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 toyota corolla xrs 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.889
 the curl up our country from Canada in its xr version 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.880
 since the basic the city 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.469
 now comes from Brazil 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.550
 with good equipment as well as with two engines 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.169
 a compact sedan vehicle 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.289
 and that is already in its tenth generation 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.059
 hurricane 'rina' has a position of political management and with a 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.059
 excellent visibility than the rest of his sentence 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.830
 although appreciated by lovers of long trips 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.510
 circulating in stretches of city and highway 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.490
 you notice a good march 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.129
 firm and smooth, allowing you to enter the corners with aplomb 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.980
 and without the body 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.240
 I have too much 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.570
 the suspension scheme is good 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 since in the front part it mounts the classic 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.240
 thuram attraction and for the back we found plastic and 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.270
 punished 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630
 something that his son 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.620
 with a scheme of four elements to have greater confidence when facing 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.100
 winding roads 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.080
 or closed radius curves 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.420
 the acceleration of the chorus the athens lever 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.970
 it is satisfactory 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 11 points 8 seconds worth highlighting 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.030
 inside naturally aspirated engines and I would like to know if the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.130
 characteristics 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.800
 the behavior in body curves 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.620
 as nervous in the absence of an independent suspension scheme in 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.730
 the back part 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.340
 at the slightest insinuation 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.510
 the vehicle telde 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.450
 In general, we can conclude by saying that the tenth generation of Toyota 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 corolla version that xr 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.980
 is prepared not only to compete with rivals within its segment 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 or the mitsubishi lancer 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.430
 but also is ready to stay in young and adults 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
 a lot more time 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.470
 the brakes are remarkable 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.700
 since it has a four-wheel disc with 14 green ibeas for this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.519
 generation 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.000
 that stop the car in just 19 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.980
 together 30 meters from a speed of 80 kilometers per hour in the segob 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.480
 the exterior style of the car retains its classic features of flagship vehicle 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.259
 Of the brand 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.329
 but approaching the traits of his older brother the tram 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.840
 since it has been able to stay current within the taste and preferences of a 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:38.750
 public 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.750
 increasingly demanding nowadays 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:47.129
 for this tenth generation the image is the one that stops talking 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.299
 the judge and wind has changed the first glance makes us think that he suffered 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.639
 just a minor aesthetic change 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.049
 this assessment is incorrect 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.459
 since now this generation has grown 13 centimeters in length and almost 7 in 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.189
 width 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.359
 distances that translate directly into a better use of space 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.099
 interior and greater habitability 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.510
 although the highlight of this growth comes in the field of management besides 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.979
 that in the most equipped version as is the case of the reese xs 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.949
 the car comes standard 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.389
 an aerodynamic package which is more aesthetic than functional 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.659
 the interior has several differences and changes with respect to what we saw in 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.339
 the crown of the previous generation and that by the way was kept in the 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.879
 market for more than five years 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.179
 now enjoys more interior space 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.729
 and with a more current image 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.049
 once we get in the driving position behind the wheel we see the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:48.609
 background 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:49.659
 a four of them 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.819
 simple increases but with easy information 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.619
 has six sunroof air bags radio with parasitism box 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.819
 mp3 player and double uem old 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.279
 as well as a travel computer 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:08.869
 the cut of the seats is suitable for long journeys aboard the 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:09.499
 car 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.589
 they are lined in a row and in the case of the driver this can be adjusted in height 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 and depth to get an ideal posture 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.789
 this one is mine 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.479
 the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.330
 which generates a power of 158 horsepower 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.860
 and a torque of 160 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.749
 to 4000 turn 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.689
 this power is transmitted 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.550
 front poets and a waterfall 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.849
 manual of five relations in front 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.080
 that is well understood with 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.099
 and that the changes 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.559
 they are accurate 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.210
 the fire price range of mexico 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.699
 starts from the 213 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.759
 Two pesos 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.080
 the 37 thousand pesos 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.900
 the case of the eu
