well<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.240> can<00:02:11.390> see<00:02:11.600> because<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.020> vehicle

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
well you can see because the vehicle

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.080 
well you can see because the vehicle
didn't<00:02:12.560> actually<00:02:12.680> head<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.850> side

mean<00:03:28.340> these<00:03:28.790> cars<00:03:29.090> look<00:03:29.180> ten<00:03:29.420> years<00:03:29.630> old<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
mean these cars look ten years old I

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.600 
mean these cars look ten years old I
mean<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> modern<00:03:30.620> designs<00:03:31.010> any<00:03:31.280> better

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610

at<00:03:31.760> surviving<00:03:32.120> these<00:03:32.360> sort<00:03:32.570> of<00:03:32.600> incidents

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
at surviving these sort of incidents

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.220 
at surviving these sort of incidents
yes<00:03:33.620> modern<00:03:34.040> cars<00:03:34.250> are<00:03:34.459> designed<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.390> undergo

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
yes modern cars are designed to undergo

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.539 
yes modern cars are designed to undergo
what's<00:03:36.410> called<00:03:36.470> an<00:03:36.709> offset<00:03:36.860> test<00:03:37.340> where<00:03:37.489> we

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
what's called an offset test where we

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.670 
what's called an offset test where we
actually<00:03:37.640> deliberately<00:03:38.239> onew<00:03:38.660> par<00:03:39.410> for<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
actually deliberately onew par for the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.310 
actually deliberately onew par for the
vehicle<00:03:40.040> width<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.450> sort<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.900> damage<00:03:42.080> that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
vehicle width so the sort of damage that

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.830 
vehicle width so the sort of damage that
you<00:03:42.410> see<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.950> would<00:03:43.430> be<00:03:43.700> less<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> modern

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
you see here would be less on a modern

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.180 
you see here would be less on a modern
car<00:03:45.080> but<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.739> have<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.040> say<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.610> 69<00:03:47.180> IRFs

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
car but I have to say is 69 IRFs

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.220 
car but I have to say is 69 IRFs
compared<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.310> two<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.640> tested<00:03:50.000> forty<00:03:50.360> or<00:03:50.600> legal

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
compared to two we tested forty or legal

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.190 
compared to two we tested forty or legal
35<00:03:51.709> miles<00:03:51.980> an<00:03:52.100> hour<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.880> still<00:03:53.030> way<00:03:53.360> above<00:03:53.540> what

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
35 miles an hour is still way above what

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.710 
35 miles an hour is still way above what
a<00:03:54.230> modern<00:03:54.590> car<00:03:54.769> would<00:03:54.950> be

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.540 

so<00:04:01.720> what<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:01.990> do<00:04:02.140> what<00:04:02.319> is<00:04:02.440> great<00:04:03.100> ideas

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
so what can we do what is great ideas

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.910 
so what can we do what is great ideas
for<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.819> future<00:04:04.270> while<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.230> fighting<00:04:05.740> sort

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
for the future while you fighting sort

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.890 
for the future while you fighting sort
of<00:04:05.980> conflicting<00:04:06.490> requirements<00:04:06.610> here<00:04:07.240> you've

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
of conflicting requirements here you've

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.150 
of conflicting requirements here you've
got<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.230> required<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.709> keeping<00:04:09.069> the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
got the required to keeping the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.370 
got the required to keeping the
passenger<00:04:09.730> department<00:04:10.270> rigid<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:11.140> that<00:04:11.170> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
passenger department rigid so that the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.290 
passenger department rigid so that the
Africans<00:04:11.740> don't<00:04:11.890> get<00:04:12.100> crushed<00:04:12.430> but<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.209> you

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
Africans don't get crushed but then you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.760 
Africans don't get crushed but then you
also<00:04:13.420> want<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.840> front<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.380> car

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
also want to at the front of the car

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.190 
also want to at the front of the car
nice<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.040> soft<00:04:15.550> so<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.150> absorbs<00:04:16.359> as<00:04:16.900> much<00:04:17.079> of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
nice and soft so it absorbs as much of

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.170 
nice and soft so it absorbs as much of
the<00:04:17.290> energy<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.680> possible<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.310> guess<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.090> one

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the energy as possible I guess the one

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.879 
the energy as possible I guess the one
thing<00:04:19.389> we<00:04:19.480> could<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:20.350> might<00:04:20.500> can't<00:04:20.739> be

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
thing we could do it might can't be

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.890 
thing we could do it might can't be
30-foot<00:04:21.340> bonnets<00:04:21.700> they<00:04:22.270> really<00:04:22.630> wouldn't<00:04:22.780> be

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
30-foot bonnets they really wouldn't be

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.270 
30-foot bonnets they really wouldn't be
practical<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.440> drive<00:04:23.620> around<00:04:23.830> on<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.100> roads

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
practical to drive around on the roads

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.520 
practical to drive around on the roads
but<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.300> mean<00:04:25.450> I've<00:04:25.690> seen<00:04:25.900> me<00:04:26.139> that<00:04:26.290> lots<00:04:26.440> of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
but I mean I've seen me that lots of

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.490 
but I mean I've seen me that lots of
cutters<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.040> racing<00:04:27.400> accidents<00:04:27.910> but

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
cutters up the racing accidents but

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.380 
cutters up the racing accidents but
nothing<00:04:29.500> quite<00:04:29.710> prepares<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.390> something

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
nothing quite prepares you for something

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.650 
nothing quite prepares you for something
like<00:04:31.540> this<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:33.190> makes<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.580> think<00:04:33.760> tell<00:04:34.540> you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
like this it makes you think tell you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.510 
like this it makes you think tell you
that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.610 
that
so<00:04:36.520> next<00:04:36.760> time<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.570> country<00:04:38.050> road<00:04:38.080> a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
so next time you're on a country road a

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.340 
so next time you're on a country road a
contraflow<00:04:39.370> are<00:04:39.550> about<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.970> overtake<00:04:40.350> just

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
contraflow are about to overtake just

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.340 
contraflow are about to overtake just
