00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
I don't know I don't have too much of an

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.250 
I don't know I don't have too much of an
acknowledge<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.120> can<00:02:02.780> still<00:02:02.960> move<00:02:03.080> it's

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
acknowledge but I can still move it's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.990 
acknowledge but I can still move it's
tough<00:02:03.440> mobility<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.160> I<00:02:04.190> did<00:02:04.460> not<00:02:04.640> cut<00:02:04.850> any

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
tough mobility so I did not cut any

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.140 
tough mobility so I did not cut any
nerves<00:02:05.360> tendons<00:02:06.520> muscles<00:02:09.759> most<00:02:10.759> likely

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
nerves tendons muscles most likely

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.240 
nerves tendons muscles most likely
seeing<00:02:14.470> analyzing<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> book<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.860> level<00:02:16.130> my

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
seeing analyzing the book the level my

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.680 
seeing analyzing the book the level my
guess<00:02:16.430> would<00:02:16.550> be<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.730> couple<00:02:17.150> Castle<00:02:17.570> area

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
think we should start a rotating topic

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.700 
think we should start a rotating topic
of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.420> week<00:04:36.540> thing<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.840> know<00:04:37.020> I'm<00:04:37.290> handling<00:04:37.560> it

of the week thing I know I'm handling it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.740 
of the week thing I know I'm handling it
for<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.890> while<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.250> Sam<00:04:38.490> did<00:04:38.700> nicely<00:04:39.330> last<00:04:39.570> week

for a while but Sam did nicely last week

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.970 
for a while but Sam did nicely last week
so<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.530> guess<00:04:42.080> bring<00:04:43.080> if<00:04:43.200> you'd<00:04:43.350> like<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.680> handle
