00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
ice for 30 minutes and that like every

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.609 
ice for 30 minutes and that like every
day<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.280> six<00:01:56.549> weeks<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:58.259> became<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
day for six weeks and it became a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
day for six weeks and it became a
difficult<00:01:59.250> shoot<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.350> they

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
difficult shoot but it's because they

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990 
difficult shoot but it's because they
were<00:02:01.560> trying<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> change<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.579> wrestler

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
were trying to change me from a wrestler

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.469 
were trying to change me from a wrestler
to<00:02:03.180> an<00:02:03.299> actor<00:02:03.630> overnight<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:05.090> which<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> cool

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to an actor overnight and which is cool

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.080 
to an actor overnight and which is cool
because<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.200> trying<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> do

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
because that's what I was trying to do

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
because that's what I was trying to do
you<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> guess<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> funnest<00:02:10.170> part<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you know I guess the funnest part was

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500 
you know I guess the funnest part was
fighting<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.610> where<00:02:11.790> ice<00:02:11.940> that's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
fighting because that's where ice that's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.210 
fighting because that's where ice that's
where<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> fall<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.860> everything

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
Don just hit me and what it did was it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.410 
Don just hit me and what it did was it
kept<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> energy<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.580> fight<00:02:47.849> because

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
kept the energy up in the fight because

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.860 
kept the energy up in the fight because
I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:49.379> did<00:02:49.849> about<00:02:50.849> three<00:02:51.209> sections<00:02:51.750> we

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
I think we did about three sections we

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.380 
I think we did about three sections we
went<00:02:52.050> as<00:02:52.140> far<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.830> could<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:53.610> before

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
went as far as we could and then before

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.740 
went as far as we could and then before
we<00:02:54.599> had<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.870> break<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.200> down<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.629> was

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
we had to break it down and and it was

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.259 
we had to break it down and and it was
cool<00:02:57.989> because<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.500> Dave<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> whole<00:02:59.430> new<00:02:59.640> process

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
cool because it Dave a whole new process

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.960 
cool because it Dave a whole new process
a<00:03:00.810> whole<00:03:01.349> new<00:03:01.500> opening<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.129> fight<00:03:02.340> scenes<00:03:02.670> for

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
a whole new opening to fight scenes for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.100 
a whole new opening to fight scenes for
television<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.019> movie

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
television and movie

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.190 
television and movie
and<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.320> think<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:07.240> fight<00:03:07.630> scene<00:03:07.870> from<00:03:08.020> they

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and I think that fight scene from they

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.330 
and I think that fight scene from they
live<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.680> Guinness<00:03:08.920> Book<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.250> World
