created these genetically engineered

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.370 
created these genetically engineered
spiders<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:20.419> did<00:03:20.569> not<00:03:20.690> know<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.019> Norman

Osborn<00:03:21.799> was<00:03:21.829> planning<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.340> use<00:03:22.669> them<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:24.230> sell

them to offshore overseas military and

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.080

on<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.049> black<00:03:30.200> market<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.590> think<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.819> they<00:03:31.940> can

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
on the black market I think so they can

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.659 
on the black market I think so they can
create<00:03:32.329> biological<00:03:32.540> weapons<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.310> which

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
create biological weapons and so which

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.370 
create biological weapons and so which
should<00:03:34.849> kill<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.239> spiders<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.079> they<00:03:36.319> do

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
should kill the spiders but they do

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.680 
should kill the spiders but they do
