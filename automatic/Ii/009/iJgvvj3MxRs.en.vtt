00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.270 
around with a fly rod fishing because
that's<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:07.530> labor-intensive

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that's just it's really labor-intensive

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
that's just it's really labor-intensive
compared<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> regular<00:02:09.450> fishing<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.140> it's

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
compared to regular fishing and it's

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.229

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
takes two hands and I honestly I don't

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.240 
takes two hands and I honestly I don't
think<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.750> could

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
think I could

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.610 
think I could

myself without using the head cap and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.020 
myself without using the head cap and
the<00:02:15.920> chest<00:02:16.190> cam<00:02:16.430> which<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.730> wouldn't<00:02:16.880> really
