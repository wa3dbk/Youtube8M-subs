on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.679> table<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.580> looks<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.239> sort<00:02:09.479> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
on the table it looks like some sort of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
on the table it looks like some sort of
map<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> question<00:02:10.679> mark<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> bottom
