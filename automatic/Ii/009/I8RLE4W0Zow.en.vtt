00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
last thing is is always look for bait we

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
last thing is is always look for bait we
have<00:01:12.930> natural<00:01:13.350> baits<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> area<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.549> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.600 
gather up some of the fish that are
feeding<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> makes<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
feeding on them and that makes it a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
feeding on them and that makes it a
little<00:01:17.729> easier<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.450> us<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.350> we're

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
little easier for us now what we're

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.590 
little easier for us now what we're
doing<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.799> we're<00:01:20.040> using<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.580> jig<00:01:20.880> head<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.299> 18

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
doing is we're using a jig head here 18

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440 
doing is we're using a jig head here 18
house<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> does<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.790> keeps<00:01:24.270> us

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
house to get what it does is it keeps us
