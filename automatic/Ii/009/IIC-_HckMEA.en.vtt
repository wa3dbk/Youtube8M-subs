00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.840
 sun op 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 what you are most 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.529
 with everyone speaking for analysis that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.779
 there is a process but it is an instrument 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 approved the degree of protection that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.170
 little penny 7 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 it does canopy analysis does anyone says 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.360
 prayers is 11 of them 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:52.950
 he does the analysis indicates third goal of the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 8.4 hardness by removing the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:02.420
 instrument is and 1960 gives show memory 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.420
 being 20 results to end up stopping 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 67 then I can use the cement 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 directly to the bottom of the bath to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.360
 make the collection analysis and extensive health 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.560
 comet catalog and now make a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 demonstration and factual analysis in ph a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 girl where there is that game I'm with a 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:36.569
 instrument connected here I have one 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.220
 button where I make the selection of the 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.530
 parameter that I wish to do the analysis 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.630
 is that here in the case colombo high 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:55.160
 concentrations of the last result of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 analysis puts bh the globe alkalinity 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.330
 copper hardness than chlorine high 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 concentrations up to 300 pms here the last 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.490
 analysis result 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 now give a demonstration of the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.020
 low free chlorine analysis 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.100
 concentrations 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.850
 I selected the serious mode that is the pole 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.000
 I have here 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.740
 the sample of water with being a wound 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 I'm going to collect and put it here. 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:39.120
 the instrument cover and go 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:44.420
 press the 0 button here 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.420
 now I'm going to get a free chlorine tape 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 I'll put it inside the area or 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:59.360
 press the play button during playback. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 count the tape inside the tape 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.790
 to be released with reagent that 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.360
 is clinging to conflict 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.980
 at the end of the count 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.000
 I take a tape back so that the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 instrument in the area of ​​concentration 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.780
 of 2.24 ppm chlorine in this sample of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.690
 Water 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.700
 now I'll do an analysis of ipea 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.430
 in the same sample 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.770
 I'm going to work 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 I'll comment on it again here. 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:46.810
 I'm using a syringe 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:49.410
 I go there sometimes to environmental tac to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:56.770
 covered in the instrument 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 I would know new show I will select bh 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:07.470
 and I'm going to do the 0 to 0 already done now 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.470
 I'm going to grab a leg brace. 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.290
 I'm going to put it inside the show and I'm going 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.130
 Hit Hits That's Reading 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:26.050
 during the count again to move 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.950
 the tape to free the half people in the 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.950
 water sample 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.429
 at the end of the routine tape count 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.429
 what cover 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:50.360
 I know that money is what is in it that 

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:52.909
 Air mass is now already closed the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.019
 our statement of a little guarded 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:04.909
 talent I'll discard the content there 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:07.519
 sometimes with clean water to 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.800
 remove any residue from the 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:18.229
 analyze 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:19.069
 I'll dry with the paper that's closed to 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.699
 our analysis 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.699
 thank you
