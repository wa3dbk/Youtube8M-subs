as<00:00:51.809> much<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> hand<00:00:52.590> anyways<00:00:53.539> I<00:00:54.539> had<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
as much as I hand anyways I had the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
as much as I hand anyways I had the
monitor<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.129> earlier<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.059> checked<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
monitor here earlier and I checked it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.459 
monitor here earlier and I checked it
and<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.649> 58<00:00:59.160> degrees<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.570> guess

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and that was about 58 degrees so I guess

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.520 
and that was about 58 degrees so I guess
that's<00:01:01.680> pretty<00:01:01.859> good
