he<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.250> looks<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:43.040> nice<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
he just looks very very nice now in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
he just looks very very nice now in
terms<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.629> robot<00:00:46.079> kibble<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.190> does

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
terms of robot kibble we can see he does

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.810 
terms of robot kibble we can see he does
have<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> little<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:50.039> formed

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
have a little bit but it's very formed

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.150 
have a little bit but it's very formed
and<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.510> doesn't<00:00:52.020> look<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.289> much<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.530> robot

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and it doesn't look as much like robot

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
and it doesn't look as much like robot
kibbles<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:53.940> expect<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.899> looks

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
kibbles you would expect it just looks

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
kibbles you would expect it just looks
very<00:00:55.140> smooth<00:00:56.120> again<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.719> smooth

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
very smooth again a lot of very smooth

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.910 
very smooth again a lot of very smooth
edges<00:00:58.320> were<00:00:58.680> used<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> works<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.739> case

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
edges were used and it works in the case

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
edges were used and it works in the case
of<00:01:01.949> dread<00:01:02.340> wing<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.789> unlike<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.329> other

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
of dread wing here unlike some other

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
of dread wing here unlike some other
toys<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.019> really<00:01:04.559> suffer<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.159> robo

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
toys which really suffer from robo

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.700 
toys which really suffer from robo
kibble<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.270> takes<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> uses<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
kibble this one takes it and it uses it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
kibble this one takes it and it uses it
and<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> small<00:01:09.150> molded

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and we can see there is a small molded

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
and we can see there is a small molded
landing<00:01:10.020> gear<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
landing gear right there and then of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.280 
landing gear right there and then of
course<00:01:11.700> two<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.330> bumps<00:01:12.630> back<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.049> which

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
course two little bumps back there which

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.429 
course two little bumps back there which
represent<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.860> rear<00:01:14.220> landing<00:01:14.700> gear<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
represent the rear landing gear now it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.460 
represent the rear landing gear now it
does<00:01:16.710> come<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.610> blaster<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
does come with this blaster it's more so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
does come with this blaster it's more so
of<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> sniper<00:01:20.280> rifle<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.000> very<00:01:21.420> highly

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of like a sniper rifle it's very highly

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
of like a sniper rifle it's very highly
detailed<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.150> different

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
detailed and it's very different

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960 
detailed and it's very different
compared<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.750> other<00:01:24.930> weapons<00:01:25.470> um<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.820> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
compared to most other weapons um and if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
compared to most other weapons um and if
you<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.630> ahead<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.020> pick<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> up

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you want you can go ahead and pick it up

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
you want you can go ahead and pick it up
here<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.159> funny<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.970> peg<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
here it's funny because the peg is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.249 
here it's funny because the peg is
actually<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.430> dreadwing<00:01:32.430> himself<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
actually on dreadwing himself and the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually on dreadwing himself and the
hole<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> weapon<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.689> slide

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
hole is on the weapon you can just slide

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.929 
hole is on the weapon you can just slide
it<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.200> top<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.610> he's<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it on top right there and now he's got a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
it on top right there and now he's got a
giant<00:01:39.360> rife<00:01:40.070> apparently<00:01:41.070> he's<00:01:41.310> supposed<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
giant rife apparently he's supposed to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.389 
giant rife apparently he's supposed to
come<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:44.420> sword<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:46.560> mine<00:01:47.009> didn't

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
come with like a sword but mine didn't

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
come with like a sword but mine didn't
have<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> sword<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.600> exactly<00:01:49.079> sure

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
have the sword I'm not exactly sure

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
have the sword I'm not exactly sure
where<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> went<00:01:49.979> maybe<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.460> fell<00:01:50.670> out

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
where that went maybe it fell out

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
where that went maybe it fell out
somewhere<00:01:51.090> along<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> lines<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> find

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
somewhere along the lines I have to find

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.060 
somewhere along the lines I have to find
it<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> wasn't<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.020> spectacular<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it but it wasn't really spectacular is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
it but it wasn't really spectacular is
basically<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> same<00:01:57.060> exact<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.049> long

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
basically the same exact thing but long

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.929 
basically the same exact thing but long

you know pretty much the back side of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.070 
you know pretty much the back side of
him<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.640> intact<00:03:45.360> not<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> lot<00:03:46.350> was<00:03:46.530> done<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:48.080> mean

him is intact not a lot was done I mean
it<00:03:49.230> really<00:03:49.440> wasn't<00:03:49.830> used<00:03:50.010> much<00:03:50.100> for<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
it really wasn't used much for the

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.449 
it really wasn't used much for the
transformation<00:03:51.019> um<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.830> then<00:03:52.980> he<00:03:53.100> does<00:03:53.280> have

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
transformation um and then he does have

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.040 
transformation um and then he does have
this<00:03:53.580> piece<00:03:53.880> kind<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.239> sticking<00:03:54.570> above<00:03:54.720> his

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
they are on ball joints and you would be

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.750 
they are on ball joints and you would be
able<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.109> rotate<00:04:19.260> them<00:04:19.560> 360<00:04:20.190> degrees<00:04:20.489> but<00:04:20.640> they

able to rotate them 360 degrees but they

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.270 
able to rotate them 360 degrees but they
are<00:04:20.880> hindered<00:04:21.359> by<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:21.989> shoulder<00:04:22.560> pad<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.100> by

no<00:04:26.110> head<00:04:26.500> articulation<00:04:27.250> no<00:04:27.400> waste

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
no head articulation no waste

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.150 
no head articulation no waste
articulation<00:04:28.389> his<00:04:28.570> arms<00:04:29.020> are<00:04:29.199> on<00:04:29.470> ball<00:04:29.770> joints

articulation his arms are on ball joints

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.350 
articulation his arms are on ball joints
which<00:04:30.280> gives<00:04:30.490> him<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.729> good<00:04:30.880> range<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.210> motion

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
which gives him a good range of motion

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.740 
which gives him a good range of motion
right<00:04:31.930> here<00:04:32.259> no<00:04:33.160> hand<00:04:33.490> articulation<00:04:34.300> his<00:04:34.509> legs

are<00:04:34.900> on<00:04:35.050> ball<00:04:35.229> joints<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.800> they<00:04:35.889> do<00:04:35.949> bend<00:04:36.340> at

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
are on ball joints and they do bend at

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.180 
are on ball joints and they do bend at
than<00:04:36.699> me<00:04:36.880> probably<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.380> little<00:04:38.650> over<00:04:38.800> 90

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
than me probably about a little over 90

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.460 
than me probably about a little over 90
degrees<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.880> then<00:04:40.600> no<00:04:40.840> real<00:04:41.080> feat

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
degrees and then no real feat

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.080 
degrees and then no real feat
articulation<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:43.050> yeah<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.430> that's<00:04:45.789> pretty

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
articulation and yeah so that's pretty

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.330 
articulation and yeah so that's pretty
much<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.539> for<00:04:46.630> this<00:04:46.900> review<00:04:47.199> of<00:04:47.650> transformers
