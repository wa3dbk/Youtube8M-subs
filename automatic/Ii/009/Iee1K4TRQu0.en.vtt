curious about them but it's not afraid
of<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.050> when<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.319> was<00:02:13.379> time<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> go<00:02:13.860> he

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630 
was not distracted and was ready to go
now<00:02:16.500> Ricky<00:02:16.800> was<00:02:16.950> pretty<00:02:17.220> young<00:02:17.400> when<00:02:17.459> we

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
now Ricky was pretty young when we

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
now Ricky was pretty young when we
exposed<00:02:18.060> her<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.480> goats<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.959> cash<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.470> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
exposed her to the goats and cash is a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.740 
exposed her to the goats and cash is a
lot<00:02:19.800> older<00:02:19.950> than<00:02:20.190> she<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.120> he<00:02:21.420> might<00:02:21.599> have

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
lot older than she was so he might have

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
lot older than she was so he might have
a<00:02:21.780> little<00:02:22.050> bit<00:02:22.170> more<00:02:22.260> confidence<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
a little bit more confidence and that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.979 
a little bit more confidence and that
may<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.580> reason<00:02:23.700> why<00:02:24.060> he<00:02:24.239> handled<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.659> way

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
may be the reason why he handled it way

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.080 
may be the reason why he handled it way
better<00:02:25.140> than<00:02:25.290> Ricky<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.370> when<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.670> met<00:02:26.819> up<00:02:26.940> with
