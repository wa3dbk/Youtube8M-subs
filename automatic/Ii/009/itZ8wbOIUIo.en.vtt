 these things 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 hate even when you're 18 years old 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.420
 statement on the internet it starts in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.260
 2000 at the time they are only 4 1500 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.910
 taxpayers

 go further with a communication 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.660

 important 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 once in the hands of the public the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.479

 some took a swim the actress 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.710
 rather than a very young 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.369
 5 obviously they are completely in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.990
 Internet 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.450
 taxpayers who choose
