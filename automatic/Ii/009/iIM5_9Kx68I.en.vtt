the reason for this is we're setting up
for<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> next<00:01:58.829> layer<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.070> material<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.390> want

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
for the next layer of material you want

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.510 
for the next layer of material you want
the<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:00.990> layer<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> hard<00:02:01.979> enough<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the first layer to be hard enough that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.460 
the first layer to be hard enough that
the<00:02:02.880> second<00:02:03.299> surface<00:02:03.479> coat<00:02:03.840> does<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.170> push

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
the second surface coat does not push

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.469 
the second surface coat does not push
through<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> initial<00:02:05.340> layer<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> not

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
through the initial layer but is not

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
through the initial layer but is not
fully<00:02:06.810> cured<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.979> adhesion<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.610> obtained

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
fully cured so good adhesion is obtained

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.809 
fully cured so good adhesion is obtained
between<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.569> layers<00:02:10.280> earlier<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.700> had

little thinner than the surface coat and
again<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.599> are<00:03:08.629> flowing<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.379> on<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.889> obtain<00:03:10.250> a

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.040 

finally<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:16.090> set<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.540> first<00:03:16.750> layer<00:03:17.020> of

finally we set the first layer of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.770 
finally we set the first layer of
fiberglass<00:03:17.620> cloth<00:03:18.040> over<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.790> resin<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.360> we

fiberglass cloth over the resin and we

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.840 
fiberglass cloth over the resin and we
use<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.260> cut<00:03:20.500> brush<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:21.100> bring<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.490> resin

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
use the cut brush to bring the resin

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.540 
use the cut brush to bring the resin
through<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.210> cloth<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:23.530> are<00:03:23.740> applying<00:03:24.010> just

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
through the cloth we are applying just

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.430 
through the cloth we are applying just
enough<00:03:24.790> pressure<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.270> get<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.600> through<00:03:25.960> but

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
enough pressure to get it through but

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.620 
enough pressure to get it through but
not<00:03:26.650> too<00:03:26.950> much<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.460> disturb<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.030> surface<00:03:28.240> coat

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
not too much to disturb the surface coat

not too much to disturb the surface coat
underneath<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:32.410> can<00:03:32.620> apply<00:03:32.890> additional

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
excessive heat from the laminating resin

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.550 
excessive heat from the laminating resin
may<00:04:01.840> warp<00:04:02.170> our<00:04:02.380> tool

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.740 

for<00:04:08.560> Additional<00:04:09.010> Sessions<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:10.150> would<00:04:10.330> need<00:04:10.570> to

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
for Additional Sessions we would need to

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.390 
for Additional Sessions we would need to
prepare<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.230> surface<00:04:11.260> for<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.160> first

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
prepare the surface for the first

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.940 
prepare the surface for the first
laminating<00:04:13.030> adhesion<00:04:13.480> layer<00:04:13.690> one<00:04:14.440> way<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.800> to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
laminating adhesion layer one way is to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.710 
laminating adhesion layer one way is to
wash<00:04:15.160> off<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:15.610> tool<00:04:15.820> as<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.360> will<00:04:16.480> feel<00:04:16.690> a

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
wash off the tool as it will feel a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.490 
wash off the tool as it will feel a
little<00:04:17.050> greasy<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:18.040> sand<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.580> little

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.520 

another<00:04:23.460> way<00:04:23.670> is<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.270> take<00:04:24.450> cotton<00:04:24.810> flock<00:04:25.290> and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
another way is to take cotton flock and

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.560 
another way is to take cotton flock and
sprinkle<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.220> over<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.580> last<00:04:26.820> layer<00:04:27.150> before

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
sprinkle it over the last layer before

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.780 
sprinkle it over the last layer before
we<00:04:27.750> go<00:04:27.930> then<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> next<00:04:28.890> morning<00:04:29.100> we<00:04:29.460> would

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
we go then the next morning we would

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.580 
we go then the next morning we would
blow<00:04:30.060> off<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.450> excess<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.020> then<00:04:31.290> start

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
blow off the excess and then start

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.960 
blow off the excess and then start
applying<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.100> resin<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:35.190> de<00:04:35.340> mold<00:04:35.550> our<00:04:35.760> tool

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
applying the resin to de mold our tool

applying the resin to de mold our tool
we<00:04:36.270> are<00:04:36.390> simply<00:04:36.840> wedging<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.350> putty<00:04:37.650> knife

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
we are simply wedging a putty knife

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.250 
we are simply wedging a putty knife
under<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.460> tool<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.060> gently<00:04:39.810> lifting

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.230 

notice<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.410> PVA<00:04:45.800> film<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.730> we<00:04:46.880> had<00:04:46.970> applied

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
notice the PVA film that we had applied

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.320 
notice the PVA film that we had applied
to<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.630> board<00:04:47.900> before<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.530> surface<00:04:48.890> coat

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
to the board before the surface coat

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.240 
to the board before the surface coat
most<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:50.660> film<00:04:50.990> can<00:04:51.230> be<00:04:51.380> peeled<00:04:51.680> off<00:04:51.950> with

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
most of this film can be peeled off with

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.190 
most of this film can be peeled off with
your<00:04:52.400> fingers<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.060> since<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.600> PVA<00:04:53.960> is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
your fingers and since the PVA is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.500 
your fingers and since the PVA is
water-soluble<00:04:54.920> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.640> wash<00:04:55.880> off<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.270> rest

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
water-soluble you can wash off the rest

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.470 
water-soluble you can wash off the rest
to<00:04:56.870> finish<00:04:57.140> your<00:04:57.290> tool
