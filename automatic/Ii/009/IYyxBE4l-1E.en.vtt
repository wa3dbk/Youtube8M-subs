00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
way and then the final part is to put

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.619 
way and then the final part is to put
your<00:04:05.400> grease<00:04:05.609> fitting<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:07.200> fire<00:04:08.099> call<00:04:08.420> if<00:04:09.420> I

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
your grease fitting on a fire call if I

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.479 
your grease fitting on a fire call if I
can<00:04:09.780> tell<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.739> looks<00:04:10.950> like<00:04:11.129> there's<00:04:11.310> already

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
can tell it looks like there's already

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.720 
can tell it looks like there's already
grease<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:14.099> what<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> believe

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
grease in there so what I believe

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.569 
grease in there so what I believe
they're<00:04:14.970> pre-greased<00:04:16.099> but<00:04:17.099> here's<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
they're pre-greased but here's the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.030 
they're pre-greased but here's the
fitting

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.660 

that<00:04:21.550> just<00:04:21.850> goes<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:22.540> there<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.370> then<00:04:27.520> you

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
that just goes up in there and then you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.710 
that just goes up in there and then you
tighten<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.060> down<00:04:28.090> with<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.420> 5/16<00:04:30.030> socket<00:04:33.720> and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
tighten it down with a 5/16 socket and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.940 
tighten it down with a 5/16 socket and
then<00:04:34.930> you're<00:04:35.110> good<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.470> go

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950
