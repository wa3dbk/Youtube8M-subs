00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.470 
slope oil will have a red and white wire
the<00:02:17.620> red<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.920> where<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.190> starts<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.030> white<00:02:19.270> is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the red is where it starts the white is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.809 
the red is where it starts the white is
where<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.720> comes<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
where it comes out and then you have a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.670 
where it comes out and then you have a
green<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.180> black<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:23.140> your<00:02:23.700> screw<00:02:24.700> coil<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
get this into humbucker mode what you do

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.440 
get this into humbucker mode what you do
is<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.800> solder<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.489> white<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.209> green

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
is you solder the white and green

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.559 
is you solder the white and green
together<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:33.190> will<00:02:33.370> make<00:02:33.610> your<00:02:33.850> hat<00:02:34.180> go

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
together and that will make your hat go

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.420 
together and that will make your hat go
all<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> way<00:02:34.930> through<00:02:35.230> both<00:02:35.380> coils<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.069> come

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
all the way through both coils and come

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.680 
all the way through both coils and come
out<00:02:36.580> your<00:02:36.730> black<00:02:36.880> which<00:02:37.269> would<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> your

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
out your black which would be your

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.930 
out your black which would be your
ground<00:02:37.930> now<00:02:38.739> what<00:02:39.010> we're<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.790> we

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
ground now what we're going to do is we

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750 
ground now what we're going to do is we
are<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.390> solder<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.840> two<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.400> white

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
are going to solder the two the white

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.550 
are going to solder the two the white
and<00:02:43.030> green<00:02:43.390> wire<00:02:43.600> together<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.440> this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
and green wire together and get this

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.559 
and green wire together and get this
into<00:02:44.769> humbucker<00:02:45.190> mode<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.790> now<00:02:46.330> we're<00:02:46.480> going

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
into humbucker mode and now we're going

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.870 
into humbucker mode and now we're going
to<00:02:46.660> wire<00:02:46.840> into<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.440> circuit<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> green<00:02:48.640> board

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
to wire into a circuit on a green board

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.930 
to wire into a circuit on a green board
like<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.239> did<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.890> basic<00:02:51.280> wiring<00:02:51.519> course

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
like we did for the basic wiring course

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.479 
like we did for the basic wiring course
that<00:02:52.660> way<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.200> open<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:54.100> can<00:02:54.250> see

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that way it's out in the open we can see

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.370 
that way it's out in the open we can see
it<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.299> we're<00:02:55.420> going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.600> throw<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> kill

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it and we're going to throw a kill

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.490 
it and we're going to throw a kill
switch<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.160> too<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.319> just<00:02:59.319> take<00:02:59.470> a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
switch in on that too so just take a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.830 
switch in on that too so just take a
quick<00:02:59.709> look<00:02:59.950> at<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.510> go<00:03:01.630> on<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
quick look at this if you go on the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.420 
quick look at this if you go on the
internet<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.170> can<00:03:02.410> get<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.709> same<00:03:02.950> kind<00:03:03.250> of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
internet you can get the same kind of

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.300 
internet you can get the same kind of
configuration<00:03:04.299> for<00:03:05.069> most<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.280> other

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
configuration for most of the other

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.430 
configuration for most of the other
pickups<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.000> discussed<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.110> second

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
pickups that we discussed just a second

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.860 
pickups that we discussed just a second
ago<00:03:08.650> but<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.730> wanted<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> concentrate<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.630> on

red<00:03:53.799> which<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.670> hot<00:03:54.819> from<00:03:55.090> one<00:03:55.269> coil<00:03:56.760> we've

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
red which is the hot from one coil we've

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.990 
red which is the hot from one coil we've
got<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.269> white<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.840> green<00:03:59.109> wire<00:03:59.410> which<00:04:00.100> we

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
got the white and green wire which we

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.670 
got the white and green wire which we
discussed<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.540> make<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.810> humbucking<00:04:02.170> we<00:04:02.530> need

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
discussed to make it humbucking we need

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.380 
discussed to make it humbucking we need
to<00:04:02.769> connect<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.430> we've<00:04:03.579> saturd<00:04:04.000> those<00:04:04.150> two

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
to connect so we've saturd those two

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.920 
to connect so we've saturd those two
together

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
together

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.500 
together
and<00:04:05.019> then<00:04:05.980> we've<00:04:06.130> got<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.549> black<00:04:06.880> which<00:04:07.239> comes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
and then we've got the black which comes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.809 
and then we've got the black which comes
off<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.810> other<00:04:07.959> coil<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.190> bear<00:04:09.549> and

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
off the other coil and the bear and

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.800 
off the other coil and the bear and
we've<00:04:10.720> saturd<00:04:11.139> those<00:04:11.319> together<00:04:11.709> now<00:04:12.609> to<00:04:13.600> keep

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
we've saturd those together now to keep

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.229 
we've saturd those together now to keep
this<00:04:13.959> really<00:04:14.290> simple<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.670> green<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.090> white

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
this really simple the green and white

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.490 
this really simple the green and white
we're<00:04:16.539> not<00:04:16.660> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.930> do<00:04:17.079> anything<00:04:17.320> with

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
we're not going to do anything with

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.560 
we're not going to do anything with
we're<00:04:17.830> going<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.010> tape<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.549> off<00:04:18.789> tape<00:04:19.359> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
we're going to tape that off tape that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.390 
we're going to tape that off tape that
connection<00:04:19.900> off<00:04:20.229> make<00:04:21.010> sure<00:04:21.039> that<00:04:21.280> it's

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
connection off make sure that it's

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.680 
connection off make sure that it's
insulated

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
insulated

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.920 
insulated
and<00:04:22.780> it's<00:04:23.500> done<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:24.850> what<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.660> is

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
and it's done now what we have to do is

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.510 
and it's done now what we have to do is
we've<00:04:26.170> got<00:04:26.380> our<00:04:26.500> hot<00:04:26.680> lead<00:04:26.920> and<00:04:27.190> our<00:04:27.280> ground

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
we've got our hot lead and our ground

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.370 
we've got our hot lead and our ground
lead<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.450> gets<00:04:28.630> as<00:04:28.810> simple<00:04:29.170> as<00:04:29.260> like

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
lead and it just gets as simple as like

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.230 
lead and it just gets as simple as like
what<00:04:29.560> we<00:04:29.680> did<00:04:29.830> with<00:04:29.980> our<00:04:30.010> basic<00:04:30.700> wiring<00:04:30.910> we're

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
what we did with our basic wiring we're

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
what we did with our basic wiring we're
going<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.420> go<00:04:31.510> hot<00:04:32.670> into<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.790> input<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:35.110> we're

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
going to go hot into the input and we're

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.080 
going to go hot into the input and we're
going<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.410> do<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:36.070> as<00:04:36.340> ground<00:04:36.670> and<00:04:37.000> that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
going to do this as ground and that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.310 
going to do this as ground and that
should<00:04:37.330> complete<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.810> circuit<00:04:38.110> for<00:04:38.230> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
should complete the circuit for the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.080 
should complete the circuit for the
humbucker<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.830> again<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.490> will<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:39.910> tape

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
humbucker and again this will just tape

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.620 
humbucker and again this will just tape
off<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:41.230> insulate<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.040> connection

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
off and insulate that connection

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.340 
off and insulate that connection
so<00:04:44.340> let's<00:04:45.340> get<00:04:45.490> wiring<00:04:45.730> here<00:04:46.150> I'm<00:04:46.360> giving<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
so let's get wiring here I'm giving it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.280 
so let's get wiring here I'm giving it
