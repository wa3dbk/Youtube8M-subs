don't think I noticed there isn't any

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.249 
don't think I noticed there isn't any
silicone<00:02:06.030> beading<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.200> prevent<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.310> from

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
silicone beading here to prevent it from

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.559 
silicone beading here to prevent it from
loosening<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:14.040> foam<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.670> closed<00:02:15.209> cell<00:02:15.540> foam

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
loosening the foam is closed cell foam

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.250 
loosening the foam is closed cell foam
what<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.379> like<00:02:16.560> about<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.459> more<00:02:17.700> firm<00:02:18.260> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
what I like about it is it's more firm I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.630 
what I like about it is it's more firm I
prefer<00:02:20.160> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
prefer that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.479 
prefer that
when<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:20.970> when<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.480> my<00:02:21.629> face<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:23.190> kind

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
when it when it's on my face it's kind

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.880 
when it when it's on my face it's kind
of<00:02:23.519> like<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.970> get<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.599> feels<00:02:24.900> more<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:28.260> place<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
of like it get it feels more in place I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.680 
of like it get it feels more in place I
guess<00:02:29.069> secure<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.980> also<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> plus<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.030> ice<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
guess secure and also a plus is ice in a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.240 
guess secure and also a plus is ice in a
sweat<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> lot<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.040> doesn't<00:02:36.650> soak<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.890> all<00:02:38.040> my

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
sweat a lot so it doesn't soak up all my

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.460 
sweat a lot so it doesn't soak up all my
sweat<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:38.849> it's<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> lot<00:02:39.180> easier<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.599> clean<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
sweat so it's a lot easier to clean and
