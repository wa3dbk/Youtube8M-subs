00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.920
 Bee, I want to talk to you about the university, okay? 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.890
 Hey, I will not take you with me. 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.189
 Look at this place! 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.319
 I already feel more ready! 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.690
 Can you feel it? 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.750
 Yes, I feel like I'll have to pay $ 40,000 per year. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.019
 Hello Beautiful. I am... 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.489
 ... your long-distance boyfriend. 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.729
 I bought you a webcam so we can chat at all times. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 It seems entertaining. I'm anxious. 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.850
 I just had a mental crisis in the middle of the class! 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 I see symbols. 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.869
 We've hidden you a lot, Sam. 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 This is not my war. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.060
 I'm afraid it will be soon. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.010
 What you are about to see is confidential. 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 Do not tell my mother. 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 Do any of them look like the symbols you saw? 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.471
 Where did he get them? 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.185
 Archaeologists found these inexplicable marks in ... 

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.340
 ... ancient ruins around the world. 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.430
 They have to mean something. A message or a map. 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.310
 From Director MICHAEL BAY 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.550
 Megatron wants what is inside my mind. 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.649
 I will not go without you! 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 Produced by Steven Spielberg 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 Sam! 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.080
 Optimus! 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.819
 Rarely does destiny appeal to us ... 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.760
 ... at the time of our decisions. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.850
