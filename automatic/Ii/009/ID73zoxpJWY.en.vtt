the leak here classic knife there's the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.210 
the leak here classic knife there's the
lock<00:01:14.810> all<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.170> does<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> hold<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> blade<00:01:16.979> from

lock all it does is hold the blade from
flying<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.570> plastic<00:01:19.850> maybe<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
flying out that is plastic maybe not the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
flying out that is plastic maybe not the
greatest<00:01:21.390> choice<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> spine<00:01:24.270> flipper

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

greatest choice I like the spine flipper
comes<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.189> fast<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
comes out really fast it also has the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.010

frame<00:01:27.720> lock<00:01:31.100> pretty<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.369> lock<00:01:33.180> system<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
frame lock pretty good lock system I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
frame lock pretty good lock system I
like<00:01:34.560> how<00:01:34.740> slim<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.729> how<00:01:36.570> thin<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
like how slim it is this way how thin it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.670 
like how slim it is this way how thin it
is<00:01:37.220> three<00:01:38.220> inch<00:01:38.340> blade<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.470> leak

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
is three inch blade that's the leak

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
is three inch blade that's the leak
we'll<00:01:41.159> leave<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:42.920> crkt<00:01:43.920> lift<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.430> no

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
we'll leave that there crkt lift off no

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
we'll leave that there crkt lift off no
lock<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> does<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
lock but what it does have is this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
lock but what it does have is this
ingenious<00:01:47.520> actuating<00:01:48.180> system<00:01:48.689> where<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ingenious actuating system where the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
ingenious actuating system where the
button<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> thumb<00:01:50.220> stud<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.299> have

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
button the thumb stud you actually have

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
button the thumb stud you actually have
to<00:01:51.479> push<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> releases<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to push down and see it releases the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.929 
to push down and see it releases the
liner<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
liner you can see that there so when you

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
liner you can see that there so when you
push<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.299> down<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.899> releases<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
push it down it releases it and then you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.980 
push it down it releases it and then you
move<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> forward<00:02:00.799> that's<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.009> lift<00:02:02.219> off<00:02:02.990> crkt

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
move it forward that's the lift off crkt

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
move it forward that's the lift off crkt
a<00:02:04.409> little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.250> expensive<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
a little bit more expensive and the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.700 
a little bit more expensive and the
other<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.049> might<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
other one might be a little bit more

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580 
other one might be a little bit more
complicated<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.399> manufacture<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.349> Smith

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

nice<00:02:21.489> pocket<00:02:21.969> clip<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:23.019> these<00:02:23.139> pocket

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
nice pocket clip I like all these pocket

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.800 
nice pocket clip I like all these pocket
clip<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.799> crkt<00:02:24.249> might<00:02:24.489> be<00:02:24.579> my<00:02:24.730> favorite<00:02:24.939> just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
clip so crkt might be my favorite just

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.119 
clip so crkt might be my favorite just
because<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.200> rides<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.499> little<00:02:26.680> bit<00:02:26.799> deeper<00:02:26.950> in

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
because it rides a little bit deeper in

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.869 
because it rides a little bit deeper in
the<00:02:27.219> pocket<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:32.879> flipper

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
the pocket but I really like the flipper

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.459 
the pocket but I really like the flipper
the<00:02:34.299> spine<00:02:34.569> actuator<00:02:35.079> on<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:36.340> Smith<00:02:36.579> &amp;<00:02:36.760> Wesson

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
the spine actuator on the Smith &amp; Wesson

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.849 
the spine actuator on the Smith &amp; Wesson
because<00:02:38.469> it<00:02:38.620> takes<00:02:39.250> minimal<00:02:39.700> movement

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
because it takes minimal movement

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.199 
because it takes minimal movement
doesn't<00:02:41.859> come<00:02:42.099> out<00:02:42.189> as<00:02:42.370> fast<00:02:42.579> as<00:02:42.790> maybe<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
doesn't come out as fast as maybe the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.379 
doesn't come out as fast as maybe the
Kershaw<00:02:43.629> or<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.530> crkt<00:02:44.799> but<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.849> decent

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
Kershaw or the crkt but you know decent

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.580

any<00:02:49.389> three<00:02:49.719> of<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:49.900> knives<00:02:50.139> I<00:02:50.349> think<00:02:50.530> would

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
any three of these knives I think would

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.349 
any three of these knives I think would
make<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.799> great<00:02:51.010> everyday<00:02:51.280> carry<00:02:51.790> spring

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359

see<00:03:29.139> if<00:03:29.229> you<00:03:29.319> just<00:03:29.560> push<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:30.040> won't<00:03:30.189> fire

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
see if you just push it it won't fire

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.710 
see if you just push it it won't fire
you<00:03:30.579> have<00:03:30.669> to<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:30.879> push<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.329> down<00:03:31.540> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
you have to actually push that down and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.039 
you have to actually push that down and
then<00:03:31.840> fire<00:03:32.139> it<00:03:32.169> comes<00:03:33.099> out<00:03:33.250> really<00:03:33.489> fast<00:03:34.049> it's

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
then fire it comes out really fast it's
