is a you know high convex grind very
nice<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.239> lean<00:03:46.390> it's<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:46.900> lean<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.560> thin<00:03:47.860> that

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
nice and lean it's so lean so thin that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.860 
nice and lean it's so lean so thin that
you<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.430> barely<00:03:48.970> even<00:03:49.030> see<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.300> microscopic

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
you can barely even see the microscopic

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.110 
you can barely even see the microscopic
bevel<00:03:50.319> on<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.310> has<00:03:51.430> plenty<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.910> support

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
bevel on it but it has plenty of support

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.030 
bevel on it but it has plenty of support
because<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.870> know<00:03:52.989> because<00:03:53.349> obviously<00:03:53.470> this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
because you know because obviously this

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.580 
because you know because obviously this
tactic<00:03:54.519> nice<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.510> gains<00:03:55.780> its<00:03:56.050> support<00:03:56.440> of

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
tactic nice so it gains its support of

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.030 
tactic nice so it gains its support of
the<00:03:56.799> behind<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.580> edge<00:03:58.349> nice<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.380> kind<00:03:59.920> of

you know just knock up the corners and
then<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.420> kind<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.840> like<00:04:08.049> widens<00:04:08.950> up<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.310> kind

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
then it kind of like widens up to kind

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.670 
then it kind of like widens up to kind
of<00:04:09.549> like<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.730> switch<00:04:10.180> towards<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.750> tip<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.290> I

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
that blue that really glares but on a

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.930 
that blue that really glares but on a
Sun<00:04:38.530> line<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:38.919> actually<00:04:39.340> see<00:04:39.580> everything

Sun line you actually see everything

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.390 
Sun line you actually see everything
else<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.419> goldish<00:04:41.050> like<00:04:41.080> gold<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.800> bronze<00:04:42.130> ish

so<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.270> works<00:04:43.630> together<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.470> think<00:04:44.950> with

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
so that works together well I think with

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.650 
so that works together well I think with
the<00:04:45.460> with<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.090> scale<00:04:46.450> front<00:04:46.750> on<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:48.660> s35vn

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
the with the scale front on that s35vn

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.490 
the with the scale front on that s35vn
kind<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.139> like<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.350> copperish<00:04:51.150> scale<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.080> I

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
kind of like the copperish scale so I

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.800 
kind of like the copperish scale so I
like<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:54.010> one<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> lot<00:04:54.520> it's<00:04:54.850> nicely<00:04:55.090> centered

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
like this one a lot it's nicely centered

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.890 
like this one a lot it's nicely centered
works<00:04:56.710> really<00:04:57.070> well<00:04:57.400> black<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.479> nice<00:04:58.630> and

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
works really well black is nice and
