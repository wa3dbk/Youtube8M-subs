00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
and then up and through the top piece

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.820 
and then up and through the top piece
and<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.769> fish<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:24.709> through<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
and you can fish for it through the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.630 
and you can fish for it through the
other<00:03:25.950> side<00:03:27.410> pull<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.560> through<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.610> little

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
other side pull it through just a little

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.320 
other side pull it through just a little
bit<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.920> point<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.310> knot<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.670> tied<00:03:32.940> we

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
bit so this point that knot is tied we

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.380 
bit so this point that knot is tied we
are<00:03:33.450> done<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:35.010> we<00:03:35.160> need<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.430> tighten<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
are done but we need to tighten it and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.840 
are done but we need to tighten it and
tightening<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.320> particularly<00:03:38.010> important

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
tightening is particularly important

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.520 
tightening is particularly important
when<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:39.720> tying<00:03:40.049> with<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> striped<00:03:40.709> tie

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
when you're tying with the striped tie

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.470 
when you're tying with the striped tie
the<00:03:43.530> way<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:44.040> done<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:48.200> when<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.350> pull<00:03:49.680> on

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
the way that is done is when you pull on

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160 
the way that is done is when you pull on
this<00:03:51.480> piece<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.230> right<00:03:52.410> piece<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.870> going

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
this piece the right piece it is going

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.550 
this piece the right piece it is going
to<00:03:55.350> tighten<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:56.010> top<00:03:56.750> piece<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.230> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
to tighten the top piece you see that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
to tighten the top piece you see that
and<00:04:00.130> when<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.430> pull<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.330> top<00:04:01.569> piece<00:04:02.080> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and when you pull on the top piece is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.590 
and when you pull on the top piece is
going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.240> tighten<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:05.170> bottom<00:04:06.600> and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
going to tighten the bottom and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.170 
going to tighten the bottom and
obviously<00:04:08.020> when<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.410> pull<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.069> tip<00:04:09.340> it's

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
obviously when you pull on the tip it's

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.730 
obviously when you pull on the tip it's
going<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.540> tighten<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.050> right<00:04:11.260> piece<00:04:12.690> so

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
going to tighten the right piece so

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.259 
going to tighten the right piece so
remember<00:04:14.740> how<00:04:14.860> we<00:04:14.920> put<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.370> bottom<00:04:15.700> piece<00:04:16.000> in

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
remember how we put the bottom piece in

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.900 
remember how we put the bottom piece in
place<00:04:16.570> first<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.620> you're<00:04:21.220> gonna<00:04:21.340> want<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:21.700> if

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
place first so you're gonna want it if

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.300 
place first so you're gonna want it if
you<00:04:22.330> need<00:04:22.570> more<00:04:22.810> slack<00:04:23.139> you're<00:04:23.860> gonna<00:04:23.980> want<00:04:24.250> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
you need more slack you're gonna want to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.340 
you need more slack you're gonna want to
do<00:04:24.610> tighten<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.450> one<00:04:25.660> first<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.380> then<00:04:28.350> this

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
do tighten that one first and then this

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.320 
do tighten that one first and then this
side<00:04:29.650> one<00:04:29.919> because<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.490> tightens<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.060> top

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
side one because that tightens the top

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.000 
side one because that tightens the top
which<00:04:31.660> was<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.020> second<00:04:32.410> one<00:04:32.530> we<00:04:32.650> put<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:32.980> place

now<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.200> training<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.710> looks<00:04:53.950> okay<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.580> can

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
now the training that looks okay you can

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.670 
now the training that looks okay you can
tell<00:04:54.940> it's<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.150> journey<00:04:55.390> or<00:04:55.510> not<00:04:55.690> but<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.620> looks

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
tell it's a journey or not but it looks

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.560 
tell it's a journey or not but it looks
the<00:04:56.979> best<00:04:57.250> when<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:57.610> can<00:04:57.639> get<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.000> stripes<00:04:58.330> to

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
the best when you can get the stripes to

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.450 
the best when you can get the stripes to
all<00:04:58.780> hit<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.080> center<00:04:59.590> of<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.919> knot<00:05:00.070> at<00:05:00.400> the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
all hit the center of the knot at the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.790 
all hit the center of the knot at the
same<00:05:00.760> time<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.419> so<00:05:02.169> tightening<00:05:02.680> is

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
same time and so tightening is

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.550 
same time and so tightening is
critically<00:05:03.220> important<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.940> do<00:05:04.300> that<00:05:04.560> remember

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
critically important to do that remember

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.390 
critically important to do that remember
by<00:05:06.130> pulling<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:07.090> bottom<00:05:07.890> you're<00:05:08.890> getting<00:05:09.100> of

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
by pulling the bottom you're getting of

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.770 
by pulling the bottom you're getting of
the<00:05:09.669> right<00:05:09.880> piece<00:05:10.150> you're<00:05:10.390> going<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.540> tighten

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
the right piece you're going to tighten

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.890 
the right piece you're going to tighten
the<00:05:10.990> top<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.560> by<00:05:11.650> pulling<00:05:11.890> the<00:05:12.160> top<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.900> the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
the top and by pulling the top of the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.180 
the top and by pulling the top of the
top<00:05:14.169> piece<00:05:14.440> you're<00:05:14.620> going<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.830> tighten<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
top piece you're going to tighten the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.870 
top piece you're going to tighten the
bottom<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.789> so<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:17.560> drive<00:05:18.010> already<00:05:18.370> looks

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
bottom and so this drive already looks

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.450 
bottom and so this drive already looks
like<00:05:19.120> it's<00:05:19.300> in<00:05:19.450> place<00:05:19.950> we<00:05:20.950> just<00:05:21.010> need<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.370> get

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
like it's in place we just need to get

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.570 
like it's in place we just need to get
the<00:05:21.580> top<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.360> right<00:05:22.539> aligned<00:05:23.080> with<00:05:23.320> it<00:05:23.580> so

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
the top and the right aligned with it so

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.550 
the top and the right aligned with it so
to<00:05:25.090> get<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.419> top<00:05:25.690> aligned<00:05:26.080> with<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.320> I'm

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
to get the top aligned with that I'm

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.180 
to get the top aligned with that I'm
going<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.770> get<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.400> little<00:05:27.729> more<00:05:28.620> slack<00:05:29.620> on<00:05:29.919> the

going to get a little more slack on the
top<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.760> then<00:05:31.630> I'm<00:05:31.750> going<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:31.930> pull<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.350> right
