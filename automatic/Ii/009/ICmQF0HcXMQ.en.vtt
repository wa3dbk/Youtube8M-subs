line that so types that's the slide on
type<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.190> other<00:02:14.370> type<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.240> call<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
type the other type is what we call the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.740 
type the other type is what we call the
plunge<00:02:16.520> battery<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.030> will<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.540> into

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
plunge battery and that will go into

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.730 
plunge battery and that will go into
something<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.800> 12-volt<00:02:20.430> SDS

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
something like this little 12-volt SDS

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.250 
something like this little 12-volt SDS
drill<00:02:22.740> now<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.550> be<00:02:23.700> able<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.270> an<00:02:24.420> s3<00:02:24.570> FDS

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
this 12-volt SDS drill you'll see me

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180 
this 12-volt SDS drill you'll see me
drilling<00:02:30.180> into<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> really<00:02:30.870> tough<00:02:31.500> concrete

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
drilling into a really tough concrete

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.910 
drilling into a really tough concrete
block<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> 12<00:02:33.480> volt<00:02:33.720> battery<00:02:34.140> they<00:02:34.650> just

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
block with the 12 volt battery they just

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.310 
block with the 12 volt battery they just
slide<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.430> they<00:02:35.580> plunge<00:02:35.910> into<00:02:36.209> their<00:02:36.510> housing

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
slide in they plunge into their housing

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.400 
slide in they plunge into their housing
and<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.970> see<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.930> light<00:02:40.110> comes

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and you can see that the the light comes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.070 
and you can see that the the light comes
on<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.340> lot<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.580> Milwaukie<00:02:42.420> tools<00:02:42.810> if

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
on and in a lot of Milwaukie tools if

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.010 
on and in a lot of Milwaukie tools if
the<00:02:43.830> charging<00:02:44.489> indicator<00:02:45.090> isn't<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
the charging indicator isn't on the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.550 
the charging indicator isn't on the
battery<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.820> tool<00:02:48.060> itself<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
battery it's on the tool itself so if I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.190 
battery it's on the tool itself so if I
press<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.520> trigger<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.050> the

press that trigger you can see the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860 
press that trigger you can see the
lights<00:02:52.410> come<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> Milwaukie<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.660> done

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
lights come so Milwaukie have done

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.590 
lights come so Milwaukie have done
everything<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.739> make<00:02:55.770> sure<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.390> can

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you're using power tools a lot of

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.340 
you're using power tools a lot of
cordless<00:03:04.890> power<00:03:05.190> tools<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.580> lot<00:03:05.700> that's<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.600> real

lithium<00:03:11.190> ion<00:03:11.430> batteries<00:03:12.030> they<00:03:12.510> are

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
lithium ion batteries they are

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.020 
lithium ion batteries they are
absolutely<00:03:13.620> world-class<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.549> we<00:03:14.610> use<00:03:14.820> them
