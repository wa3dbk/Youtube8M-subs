00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hi guys, today I teach you 5 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.049
 Very easy-to-do hairstyles for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.670
 they said that our hair're not 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.740
 cool, we wake up with our hair 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 kind of weird 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.480
 pre school work and professions 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.080
 simple I hope you like it is 5 and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.550
 10 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.769
 so do not forget to leave that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 comment with this favorite idea and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.430
 hope you like it 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 before I start I'll use this oil 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.300
 for the hair looks good but rather use 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 enough for the number one hairstyle 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 It will need four clips and let's go. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 to start separating a piece of furniture from the front 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.750
 the rest of our hair we'll leave 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 everyone back is going to get a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 right side lead to the left side 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.719
 and it's going to do the same thing to get mexico 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
 left side and take the side 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460
 right after you do that, people 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.640
 the clamp from one side to the other. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.640
 the other 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.309
 Let's do this once again Take care of one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.369
 side passes to the other takes a wick 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.799
 on the other side and holds the other 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.850
 your hair became very heavy use 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850
 more clips 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:25.100
 You're ready for our bill number idea. 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.380
 how easy it was for hairstyle number 2 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 We're going to need a shawl like this. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.790
 and let's start making a tail of 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.570
 very high horse of those who are already 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.570
 accustomed 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.720
 after it's a good prison, we 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.600
 will take away the little one will make a 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.060
 hole between your hair and it will go through 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.130
 this tail through the hole for 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 explaining is difficult but time to do 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.780
 You'll see that it's fast. 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.030
 saw how easy it is now to just decorate and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 you can use the effect of your 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.380
 preferably I'm wearing this bow 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.330
 that soon I will teach you and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.739
 super combined with our idea of 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.739
 hairstyle number 2 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.319
 hairstyle number 13 is super easy to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.989
 do and he talks with ponytail 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.510
 Just like we did on idea number 2 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.390
 We separate a wick from above. 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:49.090
 hair hid our xuxa and holds 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:51.129
 also with a very passionate field is the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.160
 hairstyle number 4 we start to 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.879
 separated from the hair, take a piece of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.620
 Down and we're going to tire this wick. 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.129
 You can make it as big as you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.129
 want to 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.330
 when it gets to the end we'll go 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.610
 put a clamp on the back and will pass 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.260
 in the hair as if it were a little 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.970
 will learn from the other side 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:30.570
 Look how beautiful our idea of 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:32.820
 hairstyle number 4 for hairstyle number 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.440
 5 you will need a clip and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.480
 locking display 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.940
 We're going to start picking up hair. 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.440
 placing it behind only the part of the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.720
 top of the head 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.060
 Let's screw it up to do it like it's 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 a bump and then you will choose the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.810
 size of the tuft you want and will 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.810
 learn from your presidency 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:59.610
 apply enough respect to your tuft 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.440
 lasted all day and that was our 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.440
 idea number 5 hot 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.240
