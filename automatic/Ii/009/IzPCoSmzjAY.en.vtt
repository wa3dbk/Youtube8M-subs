00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
tapering which is even better um so he's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
obviously columns holding up the track

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.309 
obviously columns holding up the track
which<00:01:54.060> seems<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.539> what<00:01:54.690> everybody's<00:01:55.110> kind

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
which seems to be what everybody's kind

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.749 
which seems to be what everybody's kind
of<00:01:55.350> doing<00:01:55.649> nowadays<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.490> sure<00:01:56.610> they're

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
of doing nowadays is for sure they're

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
of doing nowadays is for sure they're
putting<00:01:56.970> columns<00:01:57.299> boat<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.600> track<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
putting columns boat at the track I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.960 
putting columns boat at the track I
guess<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> trademark<00:01:59.729> for

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
guess it's kind of like a trademark for

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.449 
guess it's kind of like a trademark for
a<00:02:00.030> roller<00:02:00.479> coaster<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:01.170> any<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.530> what<00:02:02.129> not<00:02:02.310> my

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
a roller coaster or any of what not my

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.309 
a roller coaster or any of what not my
only<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.819> who<00:02:02.910> thing<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
only one who thing right here to the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.930 
only one who thing right here to the
left<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.679> saw<00:02:04.860> there's<00:02:05.129> a<00:02:05.220> fusion<00:02:05.789> pole

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
left you saw there's a fusion pole

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
left you saw there's a fusion pole
shooting<00:02:06.300> out<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.569> ship<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.050> not<00:02:07.229> sure

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
shooting out of a ship I'm not sure

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
shooting out of a ship I'm not sure
that's<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:09.090> exactly<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.509> supposed<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> be

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that's what exactly that supposed to be

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's what exactly that supposed to be
I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> ship<00:02:10.379> though<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> then

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
I think it's a ship though and then

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.559 
I think it's a ship though and then
you've<00:02:11.430> got<00:02:11.459> those<00:02:11.790> two<00:02:11.970> race<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> right

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you've got those two race that right

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.759 
you've got those two race that right
there<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> left<00:02:12.959> right<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.590> well

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
there to the left right there as well

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.650 
there to the left right there as well
those<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:14.250> ships<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.879> believe<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.629> are

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
those are also ships I believe they are

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.229 
those are also ships I believe they are
at<00:02:15.870> least<00:02:16.019> on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.040> map<00:02:17.220> itself<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.849> pretty

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
at least on the map itself is pretty

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.940 
at least on the map itself is pretty
short<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.750> only<00:02:18.930> about<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.110> minute<00:02:19.349> long<00:02:19.620> so

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
short it's only about a minute long so

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.860 
short it's only about a minute long so
it's<00:02:20.099> not<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.360> long<00:02:21.510> track

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it's not like a really long track

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.449 
it's not like a really long track
usually<00:02:22.500> roller<00:02:22.680> coasters<00:02:23.129> would<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
usually roller coasters would go a

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.110 
usually roller coasters would go a
little

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
little

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.399 
little
when<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.720> one's<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.140> minute

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
when it but this one's about a minute

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.920 
when it but this one's about a minute
long<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:26.849> still<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> good<00:02:27.209> map<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
long but it's still a good map and you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
long but it's still a good map and you
know<00:02:28.019> he<00:02:28.140> did<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.470> good<00:02:28.590> job<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.799> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
know he did a really good job with it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.039 
know he did a really good job with it
and<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.819> episode's<00:02:30.299> actually<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.780> shorter

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
and this episode's actually be shorter

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.350 
and this episode's actually be shorter
than<00:02:31.080> usual<00:02:31.379> because<00:02:31.650> i'm<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:32.069> doing<00:02:32.489> i'm

episode I'm only doing like one lab but

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.309 
episode I'm only doing like one lab but
anyway<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.970> next<00:02:39.000> map<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.510> called<00:02:39.720> Terra<00:02:40.019> torn

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
anyway the next map is called Terra torn

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.339 
anyway the next map is called Terra torn
by<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> destroyer<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.079> somebody

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
by the destroyer and this was somebody

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.660 
by the destroyer and this was somebody
that<00:02:43.409> was<00:02:43.560> unknown<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.250> had<00:02:44.370> no<00:02:44.519> clue

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that was unknown that I had no clue

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.089 
that was unknown that I had no clue
about<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.750> they<00:02:46.019> met<00:02:46.200> an<00:02:46.319> awesome<00:02:46.470> map<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.069> I

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
about but they met an awesome map and I

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.410 
about but they met an awesome map and I
thought<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.340> was<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.549> really<00:02:47.700> great<00:02:47.879> map<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
thought this was a really great map is a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.319 
thought this was a really great map is a
double-wide<00:02:49.110> map<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.610> really

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
double-wide map and you know I really

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.509 
double-wide map and you know I really
enjoyed<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.629> personally<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.159> beginning

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
enjoyed it personally at the beginning

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.309 
enjoyed it personally at the beginning
