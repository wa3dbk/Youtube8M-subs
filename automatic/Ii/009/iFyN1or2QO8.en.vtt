wing flip it over now or the missile pod
take<00:04:44.280> one<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.639> these<00:04:44.960> take<00:04:45.960> two<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.200> these

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
take one of these take two of these

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.400 
take one of these take two of these
pieces<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:48.510> stick<00:04:48.720> those<00:04:48.900> both<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.350> these

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
pieces and to stick those both of these

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.110 
pieces and to stick those both of these
holes<00:04:49.970> like<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.010> they<00:04:53.010> go<00:04:53.040> on<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.910> one

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
holes like that and they go on this one

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.770 
holes like that and they go on this one
by<00:04:54.240> four<00:04:54.300> or<00:04:54.479> right<00:04:54.750> on<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.050> edge<00:04:56.690> just<00:04:57.690> like

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
by four or right on that edge just like

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.620 
by four or right on that edge just like
that<00:05:01.040> now<00:05:02.040> take<00:05:02.280> two<00:05:02.460> 1<00:05:02.580> by<00:05:02.639> 2's<00:05:02.910> they<00:05:03.360> go<00:05:03.540> on

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
that now take two 1 by 2's they go on

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.270 
that now take two 1 by 2's they go on
either<00:05:03.750> side<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.729> like<00:05:05.729> that<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:08.130> then

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
either side of this like that and then

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.520 
either side of this like that and then
essentially<00:05:08.820> take<00:05:09.889> two<00:05:10.889> of<00:05:10.919> these<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.460> just

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
essentially take two of these and just

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:20.390 
essentially take two of these and just
line<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.950> back<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:14.669> with<00:05:14.910> those<00:05:19.400> like

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
line the back of this with those like

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.659 
line the back of this with those like
that<00:05:23.150> so<00:05:24.150> yeah<00:05:24.390> this<00:05:24.630> kind<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:24.870> shape<00:05:25.669> then

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
that so yeah this kind of shape then

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.029 
that so yeah this kind of shape then
take<00:05:27.539> a<00:05:27.750> 2<00:05:27.930> by<00:05:28.200> 4<00:05:29.870> that<00:05:30.870> goes<00:05:31.110> over<00:05:31.500> these<00:05:31.710> just

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
take a 2 by 4 that goes over these just

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.300 
take a 2 by 4 that goes over these just
like<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:33.050> then<00:05:34.050> take<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.289> smooth<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:35.010> little

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
like that then take a smooth a little

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.790 
like that then take a smooth a little
piece<00:05:35.460> with<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.669> starts<00:05:36.150> on<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.270> top<00:05:36.539> and

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
piece with the starts on the top and

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.700 
piece with the starts on the top and
that<00:05:37.800> just<00:05:38.130> goes<00:05:38.340> right<00:05:39.229> in<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.410> middle<00:05:40.560> the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
that just goes right in the middle the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.290 
that just goes right in the middle the
two<00:05:40.860> by<00:05:40.979> four<00:05:41.190> just<00:05:41.520> like<00:05:41.639> that<00:05:43.580> all<00:05:44.580> right<00:05:44.669> so

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
two by four just like that all right so

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.080 
two by four just like that all right so
now<00:05:46.220> back<00:05:47.220> out<00:05:47.870> take<00:05:48.870> some<00:05:49.169> part<00:05:49.470> 1<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:50.090> newly

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
now back out take some part 1 and newly

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.810 
now back out take some part 1 and newly
built<00:05:51.240> sub<00:05:51.539> part<00:05:51.780> 2<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.220> then<00:05:53.220> I'll<00:05:53.310> just<00:05:53.400> fit

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
built sub part 2 and then I'll just fit

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:01.659 
built sub part 2 and then I'll just fit
right<00:05:54.000> together<00:05:56.000> like<00:05:57.000> that

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.800 

so<00:06:02.669> there<00:06:03.539> you<00:06:03.719> have<00:06:03.749> it<00:06:03.870> there<00:06:04.530> is<00:06:04.800> your

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
so there you have it there is your

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.119 
so there you have it there is your
conservative<00:06:06.810> part<00:06:07.289> of<00:06:07.379> the<00:06:07.439> Pelican<00:06:07.860> you're

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
conservative part of the Pelican you're

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.659 
conservative part of the Pelican you're
right<00:06:08.280> wing<00:06:08.539> and<00:06:10.340> so<00:06:11.340> yeah<00:06:11.849> um<00:06:12.060> that<00:06:12.870> makes<00:06:13.110> one

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
right wing and so yeah um that makes one

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.969 
right wing and so yeah um that makes one
two<00:06:14.669> three<00:06:14.969> four<00:06:15.150> five<00:06:15.210> six<00:06:15.479> seven<00:06:16.319> seven

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
two three four five six seven seven
