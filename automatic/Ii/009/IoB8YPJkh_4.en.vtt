00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.850 
going to treat it with some metal prep
and<00:04:45.419> then<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.840> would<00:04:46.020> come<00:04:46.230> back<00:04:46.380> out<00:04:46.680> and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
and then this would come back out and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.220 
and then this would come back out and
and<00:04:47.280> lock<00:04:47.669> up<00:04:47.820> against<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.510> that's<00:04:49.020> the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
to run with a closed choke it's worth

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.219 
to run with a closed choke it's worth
the<00:06:17.010> wait<00:06:17.390> yeah<00:06:18.390> we're<00:06:18.660> gonna<00:06:18.810> do<00:06:19.020> a<00:06:19.050> little

one<00:06:43.640> of<00:06:43.820> the<00:06:43.880> comments<00:06:44.330> was<00:06:44.510> how<00:06:44.780> come<00:06:44.990> I

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
one of the comments was how come I

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.340 
one of the comments was how come I
didn't<00:06:45.410> clean<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:45.890> head<00:06:46.160> up<00:06:46.430> well<00:06:47.360> the

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
didn't clean that head up well the

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.390 
didn't clean that head up well the
engine<00:06:49.010> that<00:06:49.220> this<00:06:49.490> head<00:06:49.790> goes<00:06:50.090> on<00:06:51.010> it's<00:06:52.010> it's

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
engine that this head goes on it's it's

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.540 
engine that this head goes on it's it's
an<00:06:52.610> original<00:06:52.970> engine<00:06:53.750> with<00:06:54.050> some<00:06:54.860> paint<00:06:55.280> left

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
an original engine with some paint left

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.720 
an original engine with some paint left
on<00:06:55.880> it<00:06:55.940> and<00:06:56.270> so<00:06:56.870> you<00:06:57.010> if<00:06:58.010> you<00:06:58.220> have<00:06:58.370> an<00:06:58.490> engine

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
on it and so you if you have an engine

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.480 
on it and so you if you have an engine
like<00:06:58.850> that<00:06:59.090> you<00:06:59.300> would<00:06:59.450> not<00:06:59.660> want<00:06:59.720> to<00:07:00.020> put<00:07:00.380> a

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
like that you would not want to put a

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 
nice shiny painted head on it you would

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.480 
nice shiny painted head on it you would
not<00:07:05.120> want<00:07:05.180> to<00:07:05.450> put<00:07:05.720> this<00:07:06.470> head<00:07:06.740> or<00:07:06.890> even<00:07:07.190> on<00:07:07.310> it

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
not want to put this head or even on it

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.220 
not want to put this head or even on it
you<00:07:07.610> would<00:07:07.760> want<00:07:07.970> to<00:07:08.030> put<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.330> head<00:07:08.660> if<00:07:08.870> you<00:07:08.900> had

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
you would want to put a head if you had

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.650 
you would want to put a head if you had
a<00:07:09.260> choice<00:07:09.400> you<00:07:10.400> would<00:07:10.550> want<00:07:10.820> to<00:07:10.940> put<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.210> head<00:07:11.630> on
