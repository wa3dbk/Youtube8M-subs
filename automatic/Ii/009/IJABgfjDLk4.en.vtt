00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
hair before applying these you can so it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.460 
hair before applying these you can so it
holds<00:02:52.730> better<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> find<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.230> don't

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
holds better but I find that I don't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.870 
holds better but I find that I don't
usually<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.130> do<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.489> when<00:02:55.790> you're
