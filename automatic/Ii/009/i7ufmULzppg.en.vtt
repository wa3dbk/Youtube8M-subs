00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 spoke but played by the way quite well sometimes 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.540
 without a coach it turns out better than 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:17.809
 mentor less scurvy before experienced 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.809
 period when he did not need a coach 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 ran and in qualifying tried to pass 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:36.630
 18 well he has roland garros 2013 too 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.410
 gave wildcard the best achievement in paris 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.480
 and Fedorov lost two meetings with him 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.370
 were the players from the top twenty on 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 the background is not losing almost now 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:02.250

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.840
 worth one hundred and seventeenth these are good 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840
 indicators 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.650
 here persistently interrogate the tennis federation 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.780
 France gave him exactly 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.780
 Well, from the effectiveness of 40 already 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:41.390
 again went out of the sky 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.650
 about what a woman did a little 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.450
 now the main thing was to win the draw well 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.750
 Well , finally it leads around the first shift 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.750
 parties 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 beautifully you actively won 1716 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.270
 use it as if indifferent to him 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.270
 result 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:38.079
 getting here but there the game will succeed 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.079
 make a break 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.210
 there are some of them 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.580
 but 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.650
 Here's how we 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.450
 let's pass it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.610
 wow thats it a date intro 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.760
 here is just a virtuoso 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.819
 punch between legs and what type of intro quickly 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 already wins their keys 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:03.310
 and trying to crush on your opponent 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.030
 silent man is a secret yes what if u 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.030
 head happens 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.950
 brown and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:31.710
 yes and until a certain point in the third 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:34.070
 the party behind that as if found the treasured 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.070
 a button 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:45.389
 and here he is on set bol 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.330
 wins back burns wins third pair 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.699
 It seems to just and likes to play 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.629
 one pace now these shredded shortened 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:19.889
 will knock him down a little game but all 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:19.889
 This to all men here change for year and 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.719
 need to try to fight for every ball 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:37.719
 Well, he lived early that the flip is not 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:40.139
 did what they are again in another 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.139
 tennis 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:06:06.930

00:05:51.949 --> 00:06:19.590

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:28.460

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:28.460
 no carbon monoxide poisoning and gratin 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600
 but 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.750
 a source 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:06.070

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:39.870
