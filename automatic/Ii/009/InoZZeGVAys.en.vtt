00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it's almost like everybody who starts

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
it's almost like everybody who starts
drawing<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> almost<00:01:48.630> draws<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> same

drawing kind of almost draws in the same

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
drawing kind of almost draws in the same
way<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.759> children's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
way you know it's like children's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
way you know it's like children's
drawings<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:51.659> all<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> similar<00:01:52.409> but

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
drawings they're all kind of similar but

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
drawings they're all kind of similar but
then<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.549> seems<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.000> great<00:01:54.540> illustrators<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
then it seems like great illustrators in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
then it seems like great illustrators in
particular<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.880> distinct<00:01:57.390> styles

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
particular have really distinct styles

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
particular have really distinct styles
now<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.530> something<00:01:58.890> certainly

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
now is that something certainly

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
now is that something certainly
understand<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.290> something<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
understand that it's something that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
understand that it's something that
comes<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> who<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
comes out of who you are but how do you

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.330 
comes out of who you are but how do you
kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> focus<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.500> how<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> bring

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
kind of focus on that how do you bring

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
kind of focus on that how do you bring
that<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> sharpen<00:02:06.570> who<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> are

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that out how do you sharpen who you are

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
that out how do you sharpen who you are
so<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.520> conveying<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so that you are conveying it in the in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.979 
so that you are conveying it in the in
the<00:02:09.899> most<00:02:10.050> attractive<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.810> short

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the most attractive way well the short

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
the most attractive way well the short
answer<00:02:13.170> would<00:02:13.379> be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
answer would be

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330 
answer would be
draw<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:16.080> whole<00:02:16.260> process<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.920> becoming

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
draw a lot the whole process is becoming

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.790 
draw a lot the whole process is becoming
a<00:02:17.580> more<00:02:17.790> purified<00:02:18.660> version<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:19.260> yourself<00:02:19.350> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a more purified version of yourself I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800 
a more purified version of yourself I
was<00:02:20.160> reading<00:02:20.490> an<00:02:20.730> interview<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.390> Gil<00:02:21.600> Evans

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
was reading an interview with Gil Evans

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.710 
was reading an interview with Gil Evans
the<00:02:22.170> great<00:02:22.380> jazz<00:02:22.680> composer<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:24.570> he<00:02:24.630> was

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the great jazz composer and he was

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570 
the great jazz composer and he was
talking<00:02:24.990> about<00:02:25.050> Miles<00:02:25.380> Davis<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.130> he<00:02:26.310> said

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
talking about Miles Davis and he said

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.950 
talking about Miles Davis and he said
you<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.850> he<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.120> talking<00:02:27.240> about<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.780> these

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
you know he was talking about all these

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.950 
you know he was talking about all these
influences<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.920> sometimes<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.600> takes<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
influences but sometimes it takes a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.920 
influences but sometimes it takes a
little<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.530> play<00:02:31.710> like<00:02:31.920> yourself

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
little time to play like yourself

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.000 
little time to play like yourself
because<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.050> all<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.380> influenced<00:02:34.860> by<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
because we all are influenced by a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.770 
because we all are influenced by a
million<00:02:35.460> different<00:02:35.610> things<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.360> kind<00:02:36.720> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
million different things and kind of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.890 
million different things and kind of
like<00:02:36.900> Photoshop<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.910> know<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.240> up<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.780> it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
like Photoshop to know we are up and it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600 
like Photoshop to know we are up and it
comes<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.530> same<00:02:40.770> set<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.070> tools<00:02:41.340> so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
comes with the same set of tools so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
comes with the same set of tools so
those<00:02:41.760> things<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.150> talking<00:02:42.420> about<00:02:42.840> you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
those things you are talking about you

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.320 
those things you are talking about you
know<00:02:43.530> there's<00:02:43.709> gradients<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.490> Photoshop<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
know there's gradients in Photoshop and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.580 
know there's gradients in Photoshop and
there<00:02:45.420> are<00:02:45.510> different<00:02:45.870> tools<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.320> we<00:02:46.410> can

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
there are different tools that we can

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110 
there are different tools that we can
use<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.800> we<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.400> access<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> same

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
use that we all have access to the same

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.449 
use that we all have access to the same
ones<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.800> use<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.250> learn

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
ones and the more you use it you learn

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.160 
ones and the more you use it you learn
how<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.730> tweak<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.570> tools<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:52.080> are

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
how to tweak the tools that are

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.260 
how to tweak the tools that are
available<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.860> personalize<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.000> cross

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
available and personalize it and cross

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.930 
available and personalize it and cross
pollinate<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> things<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:56.190> experimentation

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
pollinate the things and experimentation

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.840 
pollinate the things and experimentation
ties<00:02:57.330> into<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> big<00:02:58.739> way<00:02:58.860> well<00:02:59.220> so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
ties into this a big way well so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180 
ties into this a big way well so
ironically<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.690> seems<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.140> almost<00:03:01.410> copying

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
ironically it seems like almost copying

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.729 
ironically it seems like almost copying
other<00:03:02.430> people<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.270> other<00:03:03.660> people's<00:03:04.200> styles

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
other people and other people's styles

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.620 
other people and other people's styles
in<00:03:04.980> your<00:03:05.070> development<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:06.150> actually<00:03:06.420> lead

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
in your development can actually lead

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.190 
in your development can actually lead
you<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.020> developing<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.590> own<00:03:07.650> style<00:03:07.770> somehow

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
you to developing your own style somehow

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.360 
you to developing your own style somehow
absolutely<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.440> that's<00:03:10.680> always<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> fine<00:03:11.340> line

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
absolutely and that's always a fine line

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.830 
absolutely and that's always a fine line
too<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.270> think<00:03:12.300> when<00:03:12.630> you're<00:03:12.810> young

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
too because I think when you're young

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.140 
too because I think when you're young
especially<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:13.860> not<00:03:14.220> even<00:03:14.459> young<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.820> terms<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
especially or not even young in terms of

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.699 
especially or not even young in terms of
age<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:15.750> you're<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:16.020> beginning<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.500> do

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
age but when you're just beginning to do

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.080 
age but when you're just beginning to do
something<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:17.220> working<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.820> sketchbook

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
something like working in a sketchbook

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.570 
something like working in a sketchbook
or<00:03:18.480> drawing<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.799> important<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.310> look

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
or drawing that it's important to look

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.699 
or drawing that it's important to look
at<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.420> work<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.720> other<00:03:21.900> artists<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.590> know

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
at the work of other artists you know

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.370 
at the work of other artists you know
there's<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.519> other<00:03:24.420> artists<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.170> been

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
there's the other artists have been

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.930 
there's the other artists have been
probably<00:03:26.070> faced<00:03:26.310> with<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.519> same<00:03:26.700> challenges

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
probably faced with the same challenges

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.820 
probably faced with the same challenges
you<00:03:27.600> are<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.989> terms<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.410> how<00:03:28.590> does

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
you are in terms of how does

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.710 
you are in terms of how does
cross-hatching<00:03:29.400> work<00:03:29.850> or<00:03:30.120> how<00:03:30.269> does<00:03:30.510> working

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
cross-hatching work or how does working

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.080 
cross-hatching work or how does working
with<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.380> brush<00:03:31.620> pen<00:03:31.890> work<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.940> yeah

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
with the brush pen work and so yeah

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.150 
with the brush pen work and so yeah
looking<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.660> lot<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.870> other<00:03:34.080> artists<00:03:34.739> we

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
looking at a lot of other artists we

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.009 
looking at a lot of other artists we
take<00:03:35.610> little<00:03:35.790> bits<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.330> pieces<00:03:36.390> from<00:03:36.900> all

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
take little bits and pieces from all

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.900

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
using and yet I seem to find that with

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.440 
using and yet I seem to find that with
people<00:04:01.830> who<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.519> style<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.180> doesn't

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
people who really have style it doesn't

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.090 
people who really have style it doesn't
matter<00:04:03.630> what<00:04:03.959> they're<00:04:04.110> drawing<00:04:04.410> with<00:04:04.650> that

matter what they're drawing with that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.340 
matter what they're drawing with that
style<00:04:05.340> always<00:04:05.549> seems<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.000> come<00:04:06.269> out<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.720> yet<00:04:07.320> I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
style always seems to come out and yet I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810 
style always seems to come out and yet I
can<00:04:07.620> use<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.890> same<00:04:08.070> materials<00:04:08.580> you're<00:04:08.790> using

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
can use the same materials you're using

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.390 
can use the same materials you're using
and<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:10.290> doesn't<00:04:10.620> necessarily<00:04:11.010> look<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
and it doesn't necessarily look like the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.440 
and it doesn't necessarily look like the
way<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.549> do<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:11.970> what<00:04:12.090> do<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.209> think<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
way you do it what do you think the

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940 
way you do it what do you think the
connection<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.930> between<00:04:13.049> those<00:04:13.380> two<00:04:13.530> or<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.829> it

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
connection is between those two or is it

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.069 
connection is between those two or is it
that<00:04:14.130> we<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.820> if<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:15.420> have<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.540> certain<00:04:15.810> solid

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
that we just if we have a certain solid

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.830 
that we just if we have a certain solid
we<00:04:16.140> like<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.320> certain<00:04:16.650> kind<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:16.919> tool<00:04:17.810> well<00:04:18.810> I

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
think we all respond to tools just a

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.940 
think we all respond to tools just a

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.020 
like really inspired by it and I felt
like<00:06:18.169> it<00:06:18.320> added<00:06:18.349> it<00:06:18.830> helped<00:06:19.370> strangely<00:06:19.909> enough

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030

it<00:06:20.180> helped<00:06:20.360> me<00:06:20.479> to<00:06:20.659> kind<00:06:21.169> of<00:06:21.340> recognize<00:06:22.340> my<00:06:22.550> own

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
it helped me to kind of recognize my own

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.370 
it helped me to kind of recognize my own
voice<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:23.090> bit<00:06:23.210> more<00:06:23.389> clearly<00:06:23.630> but<00:06:24.199> I<00:06:24.259> think

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
voice a bit more clearly but I think

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.570 
voice a bit more clearly but I think
also<00:06:24.500> you're<00:06:24.680> gonna<00:06:24.800> show<00:06:24.979> us<00:06:25.099> some<00:06:25.130> new<00:06:25.250> and

also you're gonna show us some new and

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.120 
also you're gonna show us some new and
interesting<00:06:25.759> techniques<00:06:26.389> that<00:06:26.630> will<00:06:26.810> be<00:06:27.130> very

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
interesting techniques that will be very

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.149 
interesting techniques that will be very
different<00:06:28.370> to<00:06:28.550> people<00:06:28.990> using<00:06:29.990> common<00:06:30.889> art

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
different to people using common art

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.740 
different to people using common art
supplies<00:06:31.610> but<00:06:31.639> in<00:06:31.940> new<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.330> different<00:06:32.449> ways

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
supplies but in new and different ways

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.540 
supplies but in new and different ways
so<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.229> think<00:06:33.469> it's<00:06:33.710> gonna<00:06:33.830> be<00:06:34.009> really<00:06:34.159> exciting

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550
