well<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> both<00:00:53.879> countries<00:00:54.120> have

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.350 
well we think that both countries have
historically<00:00:55.530> underexplored<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:57.030> modern

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
techniques and that's what borders there

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.390 
techniques and that's what borders there
for<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> opportunity<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.220> case<00:01:02.370> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
years and they would had trade sanctions

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
years and they would had trade sanctions
against<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> Western<00:01:25.229> companies

really high grade deposit and I took a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.730 
really high grade deposit and I took a
counter<00:03:08.340> market<00:03:08.760> view<00:03:08.970> which<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.600> go<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.710> it

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
counter market view which was go for it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.880 
counter market view which was go for it
and<00:03:11.360> hence<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> 22<00:03:12.840> thousand<00:03:13.230> meters<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.740> not

everything to 43-101 stand so we are

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.630 
everything to 43-101 stand so we are
resources<00:04:12.000> at<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.330> 43-101<00:04:13.100> as<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.310> say<00:04:14.490> our

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
resources at the 43-101 as you say our

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.220 
resources at the 43-101 as you say our
preliminary<00:04:14.910> economic<00:04:15.270> assessment<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.140> in

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
preliminary economic assessment is in

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.960 
preliminary economic assessment is in
the<00:04:16.290> March<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.680> year<00:04:16.739> 243<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
the March this year 243 one and so the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.150 
the March this year 243 one and so the
next<00:04:18.120> step<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.989> result<00:04:19.320> update<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.890> get<00:04:20.040> more

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
next step is a result update to get more

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.610 
next step is a result update to get more
to<00:04:20.310> indicate<00:04:20.730> analysis<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:22.320> we're<00:04:22.470> going

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
to indicate analysis then we're going

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.190 
to indicate analysis then we're going
into<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> pre-feasibility<00:04:23.460> study<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:25.050> so

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
into the pre-feasibility study and so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.890 
into the pre-feasibility study and so
we're<00:04:25.350> doing<00:04:25.560> now<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.060> other<00:04:27.060> studies<00:04:27.450> to

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
we're doing now the other studies to

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.350 
we're doing now the other studies to
that<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:28.950> should<00:04:29.130> have<00:04:29.310> out<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:30.210> matter

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
that so we should have out in a matter

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.300 
that so we should have out in a matter
of<00:04:30.510> weeks<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.960> metallurgical<00:04:31.650> studies<00:04:32.040> the

underground<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.820> recent<00:05:06.180> round<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.480> drilling

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
underground the recent round of drilling

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.690 
underground the recent round of drilling
is<00:05:07.020> really<00:05:07.380> aimed<00:05:07.650> at<00:05:07.920> seeing<00:05:08.190> whether<00:05:08.340> we<00:05:08.550> can

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
is really aimed at seeing whether we can

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.540 
is really aimed at seeing whether we can
have<00:05:08.910> one<00:05:09.360> hundred<00:05:09.630> percent<00:05:09.660> apron<00:05:10.170> pit

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
have one hundred percent apron pit

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.940 
have one hundred percent apron pit
production<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.730> first<00:05:11.940> five<00:05:12.210> years<00:05:12.950> and

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
production for the first five years and

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.460 
production for the first five years and
not<00:05:14.310> do<00:05:14.910> one<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.240> then<00:05:15.390> fund<00:05:15.840> underground

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
not do one and then fund underground

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.050 
not do one and then fund underground
development<00:05:16.620> out<00:05:17.040> of<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.280> benefit<00:05:17.580> production

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
development out of a benefit production

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.760 
development out of a benefit production
that<00:05:18.600> would<00:05:18.750> reduce<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.200> upfront<00:05:19.350> capital

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
that would reduce the upfront capital

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.130 
that would reduce the upfront capital
costs<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.370> I'm<00:05:20.460> expecting<00:05:21.120> as<00:05:21.780> what<00:05:21.990> we're

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
costs so I'm expecting as what we're

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.690 
costs so I'm expecting as what we're
trying<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.350> achieve<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.190> recent

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
trying to achieve and the recent

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.730 
trying to achieve and the recent
drilling<00:05:23.940> shows<00:05:24.150> we're<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.480> track<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:24.750> do<00:05:25.050> that

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
drilling shows we're on track to do that

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.700 
drilling shows we're on track to do that
should<00:05:25.950> reduce<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.690> upfront<00:05:27.690> capex<00:05:28.350> number

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
should reduce that upfront capex number

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.770 
should reduce that upfront capex number
by<00:05:28.920> tens<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.880> millions<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.390> we'll<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.630> to

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
by tens of millions so we'll have to

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.570 
by tens of millions so we'll have to
wait<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:30.930> see<00:05:31.140> what<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.440> final<00:05:31.740> outcome<00:05:32.070> is

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
wait and see what the final outcome is

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.350 
wait and see what the final outcome is
do<00:05:33.540> you<00:05:33.600> have<00:05:33.780> any<00:05:34.070> timeframe<00:05:35.070> for<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:36.270> know

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
do you have any timeframe for you know

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.530 
do you have any timeframe for you know

said we will take this to bank or
feasibility<00:05:44.550> study<00:05:44.820> we<00:05:45.480> then<00:05:45.690> we'll<00:05:46.080> make<00:05:46.230> a

decision as to whether we build the mine
ourselves<00:05:48.810> or<00:05:49.020> we<00:05:49.860> sell<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.190> project<00:05:50.640> and
