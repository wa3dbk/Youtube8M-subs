i'm<00:00:15.809> destinee<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.520> my<00:00:17.699> m9<00:00:25.099> for<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.189> last

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
i'm destinee this is my m9 for my last

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.140 
i'm destinee this is my m9 for my last
video<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.180> took<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.260> my<00:00:28.289> PC<00:00:28.920> 38<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.730> range

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
video I took out my PC 38 to the range

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
video I took out my PC 38 to the range
and<00:00:30.359> did<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.779> one-handed<00:00:31.320> bullseye

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and did this one-handed bullseye

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.580 
and did this one-handed bullseye
challenge<00:00:32.579> did<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> same<00:00:33.600> thing<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.200> m9

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
challenge did the same thing with my m9

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
challenge did the same thing with my m9
but<00:00:35.550> instead<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> thinking<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.930> math

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
but instead of thinking about the math

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.520 
but instead of thinking about the math
aspect<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:39.000> goes<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.390> shooting<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.020> was

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
aspect of what goes into shooting I was

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.369 
aspect of what goes into shooting I was
thinking<00:00:40.860> more<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.879> physiology<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
thinking more about the physiology the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
thinking more about the physiology the
anatomy<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.120> impacts<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.360> impact

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
anatomy that impacts what can impact

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.560 
anatomy that impacts what can impact
your<00:00:45.899> shooting<00:00:46.430> these<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.610> warning<00:00:47.760> I'm

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
your shooting these are warning I'm

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
your shooting these are warning I'm
gonna<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.829> science<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
gonna look at some science for this

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
gonna look at some science for this
video<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.390> totally<00:00:51.840> boring<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.379> don't

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
video if that's totally boring you don't

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
video if that's totally boring you don't
want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> watch<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.129> ahead<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.520> skip<00:00:54.120> to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.930 
might think that what a muscle contracts
are<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.020> contracts<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.700> that's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
are just all contracts but that's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.870 
are just all contracts but that's
tetanus<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:28.170> bad<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:29.640> really

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
tetanus and that's bad what really

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.630 
tetanus and that's bad what really
happens<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.989> more<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.410> an<00:02:31.739> orchestra

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
happens is it's more like an orchestra

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.970 
happens is it's more like an orchestra
of<00:02:33.090> lots<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> different<00:02:33.930> fibers<00:02:34.590> working

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
of lots of different fibers working

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.590 
of lots of different fibers working
together<00:02:35.100> some<00:02:35.610> are<00:02:35.730> contracting<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.420> some

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
together some are contracting and some

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320 
together some are contracting and some
are<00:02:36.690> relaxing<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> same<00:02:37.620> time<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
are relaxing at the same time and the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.300 
are relaxing at the same time and the
nervous<00:02:39.630> system<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.080> sending<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.799> signals

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
nervous system is sending these signals

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.479 
nervous system is sending these signals
to<00:02:41.549> try<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.110> fine<00:02:43.110> tune<00:02:43.560> which<00:02:44.010> ones<00:02:44.310> are

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
to try and fine tune which ones are

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.160 
to try and fine tune which ones are
contracting<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.150> which<00:02:45.269> ones<00:02:45.480> are<00:02:45.630> relaxing

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
contracting and which ones are relaxing

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.100 
contracting and which ones are relaxing
even<00:02:46.920> within<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.670> muscle<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.930> have

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
even within one muscle and then you have

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 
even within one muscle and then you have
opposing<00:02:49.950> muscles<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.519> your<00:02:50.820> triceps<00:02:51.299> and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
opposing muscles like your triceps and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.080 
opposing muscles like your triceps and
biceps<00:02:51.709> working<00:02:52.709> all<00:02:53.100> together<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.790> try<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
biceps working all together to try and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.550 
biceps working all together to try and
keep<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.420> wall<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.959> steady<00:02:55.230> there's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
keep that wall up steady there's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560 
keep that wall up steady there's
actually<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> lot<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.519> on<00:02:56.610> even<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
actually a lot going on even down to the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.979 
actually a lot going on even down to the
cellular<00:02:58.170> level<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:59.030> that's<00:03:00.030> kind<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.780> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
cellular level and that's kind of what I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.539 
cellular level and that's kind of what I
have<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.590> when<00:03:01.860> I'm<00:03:01.980> trying<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> manage

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
have going on when I'm trying to manage

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.910 
have going on when I'm trying to manage
that<00:03:02.940> wall<00:03:03.180> bowling<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.320> m9<00:03:04.680> this

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that wall bowling I have the m9 this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:40.740 
that wall bowling I have the m9 this
time<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:05.910> well<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> did

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.620 

okay<00:03:41.750> let<00:03:41.990> me<00:03:42.020> have<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.440> one
