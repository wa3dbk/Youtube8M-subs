typically you do have two foreign dwarf
voice<00:01:54.360> coils<00:01:54.660> so<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.830> two

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
voice coils so if you take two and two

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.340 
voice coils so if you take two and two
ohm's<00:01:57.300> law<00:01:57.540> says<00:01:57.870> you<00:01:58.080> put<00:01:58.200> them<00:01:58.290> together

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
ohm's law says you put them together

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.630 
ohm's law says you put them together
you're<00:01:58.680> parallel<00:01:59.040> you're<00:01:59.220> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.400> get<00:01:59.520> two

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you're parallel you're going to get two

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
you're parallel you're going to get two
ohms

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090

that's<00:02:00.660> not<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.110> you're<00:02:01.260> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.440> get

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that's not what you're going to get

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
that's not what you're going to get
you're<00:02:01.830> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.600> mmm<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.690> got<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you're going to actually get mmm I got a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.720 
you're going to actually get mmm I got a
couple<00:02:04.230> measurements<00:02:04.440> I<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.130> point<00:02:05.400> six

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
couple measurements I got one point six

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.760 
couple measurements I got one point six
two<00:02:06.060> times<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.960> point<00:02:07.230> seven<00:02:07.590> one

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
two times and I got one point seven one

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
two times and I got one point seven one
a<00:02:08.039> couple<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.090> times<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.780> sure

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
a couple more times so I'm not sure

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.649 
a couple more times so I'm not sure
which<00:02:10.110> one<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.579> but<00:02:11.579> typically<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.420> rule<00:02:12.629> is

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
which one it is but typically my rule is

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.989 
which one it is but typically my rule is
go<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.439> higher<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.829> two<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.819> that's

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999 
go with the higher of the two so that's

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.690 
go with the higher of the two so that's
one<00:02:15.150> let's<00:02:15.299> say<00:02:15.420> what<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.719> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
one let's say what it is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.190 
one let's say what it is
be<00:02:17.700> careful<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.659> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:18.989> an<00:02:19.080> amplifier

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
be careful so if you have an amplifier

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.180 
be careful so if you have an amplifier
and<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.790> only<00:02:21.120> too<00:02:21.269> unstable<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.830> careful

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and it's only too unstable to be careful

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.320 
and it's only too unstable to be careful
when<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> wire<00:02:23.580> these<00:02:23.790> things<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.180> because

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
when you wire these things up because

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.830 
when you wire these things up because
you<00:02:24.629> might<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.940> little<00:02:27.540> bit<00:02:27.720> of

you might have you know a little bit of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
a too low of an impedance and it could

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.089 
a too low of an impedance and it could

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
draw a little more current or you know

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.100 
draw a little more current or you know

do some damage to your amplifier because

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.570 
do some damage to your amplifier because
you<00:02:34.319> need<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.620> stay<00:02:34.799> within<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.099> correct

going to be a very good or what's to say

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.690 
going to be a very good or what's to say
if<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.420> were<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.409> kind<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> guy<00:02:46.829> runs<00:02:47.430> around

if you were the kind of guy runs around

you're going to have a supreme advantage
over<00:02:55.349> those<00:02:55.560> guys<00:02:55.769> because<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.849> going<00:02:57.120> in

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
over those guys because you're going in

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.360 
over those guys because you're going in
there<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.959> woofer<00:02:58.560> that's<00:02:58.739> stating<00:02:59.220> it's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
there with a woofer that's stating it's

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
there with a woofer that's stating it's
4<00:02:59.549> ohms<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.269> really<00:03:00.569> doing<00:03:00.840> just<00:03:00.989> touch

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
4 ohms and it's really doing just touch

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.080 
4 ohms and it's really doing just touch
below<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.890> you're<00:03:02.519> actually<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> have

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
below that you're actually going to have

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.460 
below that you're actually going to have
an<00:03:03.180> advantage<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:03.569> lower<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.079> impedance

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
an advantage because lower the impedance

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.470 
an advantage because lower the impedance
the<00:03:04.590> higher<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.920> power<00:03:05.129> that's<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.359> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the higher the power that's the way it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
the higher the power that's the way it
works<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.870> Newcombe<00:03:10.370> it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
works so you know this Newcombe it's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.569 
works so you know this Newcombe it's
very<00:03:11.579> rigid<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:13.140> did<00:03:13.650> pop<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.040> out<00:03:14.129> that's<00:03:14.459> why

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
very rigid I did pop it out that's why

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.880 
very rigid I did pop it out that's why
you<00:03:14.640> see<00:03:14.879> these<00:03:15.000> wires<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.629> a<00:03:15.660> DC<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.349> also

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
you see these wires with a DC I also

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.130 
you see these wires with a DC I also

amplifier<00:03:20.010> output<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:20.970> did<00:03:21.660> sound<00:03:21.840> very

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
amplifier output it did sound very

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.879 
amplifier output it did sound very
smooth<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:24.030> reminds<00:03:24.930> me<00:03:25.079> very<00:03:25.169> much<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.590> the

totally<00:03:34.950> different<00:03:35.419> if<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.540> told<00:03:36.750> me<00:03:36.840> before

I<00:03:37.260> open<00:03:37.590> up<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.769> box<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.099> saw<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.430> myself

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
I open up the box and saw for myself

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.220 
I open up the box and saw for myself
that<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.060> was<00:03:39.209> made<00:03:39.389> by<00:03:39.419> diamond<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.959> wouldn't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that this was made by diamond I wouldn't

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.800 
that this was made by diamond I wouldn't
even<00:03:40.319> believe<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:42.450> kind<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.750> looks<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.049> I

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
even believe you it kind of looks like I

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.839 
even believe you it kind of looks like I
know<00:03:45.810> maybe<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.410> JL<00:03:46.889> or<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.220> old<00:03:47.370> Eclipse

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
know maybe like a JL or the old Eclipse

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.099 
know maybe like a JL or the old Eclipse
something<00:03:48.180> like<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.989> got

that kind of look to it you know I'm not
forward<00:03:52.980> I'm<00:03:53.130> not<00:03:53.190> against<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.849> it's<00:03:54.480> okay

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
forward I'm not against it it's okay

very thick for every few again it feels

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.210 
very thick for every few again it feels
very<00:04:03.690> much<00:04:03.959> like<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.230> d3<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.769> almost<00:04:04.950> feels

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
very much like the d3 it almost feels

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.500 
very much like the d3 it almost feels
like<00:04:05.280> they<00:04:05.459> took<00:04:05.639> them<00:04:05.790> very<00:04:06.060> much<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.419> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
like they took them very much of the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.379 
like they took them very much of the
tooling<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.169> d3<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.329> implemented<00:04:09.329> it

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
tooling from the d3 and implemented it

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.619 
tooling from the d3 and implemented it
on<00:04:09.480> his<00:04:09.629> TX<00:04:09.989> series<00:04:11.299> well<00:04:13.639> it<00:04:14.639> feels<00:04:14.790> ok<00:04:15.209> where

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
on his TX series well it feels ok where

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.259 
on his TX series well it feels ok where
it<00:04:15.750> comes<00:04:15.930> together<00:04:16.049> everything<00:04:16.560> seems<00:04:16.769> nice

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
it comes together everything seems nice

outstandingly in a sealed box and I
agree<00:04:35.730> why<00:04:36.000> because<00:04:36.420> sealed<00:04:36.750> boxes<00:04:37.110> think<00:04:37.380> if

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
agree why because sealed boxes think if

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.340 
agree why because sealed boxes think if
you<00:04:38.520> want<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.760> sealed<00:04:39.000> box<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.570> know<00:04:39.690> get<00:04:40.320> rid

you want a sealed box you know get rid

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.960 
you want a sealed box you know get rid
of<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.680> get<00:04:40.860> yourself<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.220> vented<00:04:41.550> box<00:04:41.580> because

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
of it get yourself a vented box because

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.240 
of it get yourself a vented box because
number<00:04:42.210> one<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.900> can't<00:04:43.140> -<00:04:43.320> nice<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.920> output

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
number one you can't - nice the output

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.550 
number one you can't - nice the output
on<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.600> that's<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> first<00:04:46.020> problem<00:04:46.260> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
on it that's the first problem and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.920 
on it that's the first problem and
second<00:04:47.130> with<00:04:47.220> these<00:04:47.400> these<00:04:47.730> woofers<00:04:48.210> pretty

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
second with these these woofers pretty

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.690 
second with these these woofers pretty
much<00:04:49.110> like<00:04:49.320> any<00:04:49.500> diamond<00:04:49.860> woofer<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.310> going<00:04:50.610> to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
much like any diamond woofer is going to

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.420 
much like any diamond woofer is going to
excel<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.210> really<00:04:51.450> do<00:04:51.600> its<00:04:51.800> most<00:04:52.800> performance

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
when it's in a vented enclosure that's

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.420 
when it's in a vented enclosure that's
the<00:04:56.790> way<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:56.970> should<00:04:57.060> do<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:58.160> now<00:04:59.160> for

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
the way you should do it now for

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.070 
the way you should do it now for
instance<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.860> guy<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.690> going<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.750> call<00:05:04.050> for

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
instance this guy is going to call for

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.040 
instance this guy is going to call for
1.2<00:05:05.010> cubic<00:05:05.490> foot<00:05:05.700> in<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.000> sealed<00:05:06.300> enclosure<00:05:06.780> or

1.2 cubic foot in a sealed enclosure or

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.590 
1.2 cubic foot in a sealed enclosure or
1<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.860> 3/4<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.460> invented<00:05:08.880> that's<00:05:09.060> really<00:05:09.450> not

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
1 and 3/4 and invented that's really not

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840 
1 and 3/4 and invented that's really not
too<00:05:09.900> far<00:05:10.320> off<00:05:10.350> that's<00:05:11.250> actually<00:05:11.670> not<00:05:11.790> bad

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
too far off that's actually not bad

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.020 
too far off that's actually not bad
especially<00:05:12.270> for<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.750> 12<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:14.580> know<00:05:14.730> it's<00:05:14.880> got<00:05:15.000> a

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
especially for a 12 you know it's got a

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.150 
especially for a 12 you know it's got a
pretty<00:05:15.300> good-sized<00:05:15.810> Magna<00:05:16.230> structure<00:05:16.620> that

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
pretty good-sized Magna structure that

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.980 
pretty good-sized Magna structure that
should<00:05:17.460> keep<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.790> boil<00:05:18.090> voice<00:05:18.450> coil<00:05:18.720> in

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
should keep that boil voice coil in

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.780 
should keep that boil voice coil in
check<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:20.490> got<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:21.350> vented<00:05:22.460> coil<00:05:23.460> as<00:05:23.640> well

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
check it's got a a vented coil as well

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.940 
check it's got a a vented coil as well
it's<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:24.960> think<00:05:25.260> it's<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.410> 2<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> half

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
it's like I think it's a 2 and a half

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.970 
it's like I think it's a 2 and a half
inch<00:05:26.220> of<00:05:26.580> 4<00:05:27.420> wrap<00:05:27.690> type<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.260> voice<00:05:28.470> coil<00:05:28.770> so

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
inch of 4 wrap type of a voice coil so

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.250
