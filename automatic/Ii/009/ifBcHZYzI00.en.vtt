00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.429
 bibliofilia book maca pages and I have 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.119
 to tell you that summer came yes with 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:23.039
 the summer and the heat the pools of the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.760
 chlorine bathing suits beach sand 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 We're going to be a pain in the ass but good 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.759
 comes the heat and is supposed to arrive 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 Well , good weather and these things 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.520
 we also have more time in principle 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 to read I'm going to propose 5 readings 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 to read in summer are five 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.360
 recommendations that I make myself 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 to make my hands to force me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 read them a kind of to be read 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 but good that at the same time I recommend it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.859
 to you we begin in the first place 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.310
 we have horns joe hill I there 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.800
 hand what is this going to sound like a movie 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.110
 the radcliffe testers and this guy's 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.970
 the one of harry potter the way of mattis 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 Martin Perry became a technical one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 hell when his girlfriend was killed 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 the suspicion fell on the doubt and all the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.940
 people I suspect that one day events 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 after a big drunken 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.840
 they will raise matthew if he discovers that he has 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.760
 a few bumps on his forehead 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.410
 it turns out they are more than just horns 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 some horns that have an effect 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.190
 quite strange with people do 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 that they reveal their darkest 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.630
 secrets and wishes start an argument 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 quite original that I think is going to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.780
 have a lot of chicha and I'm going to have fun 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 a lot I think it's going to be a novel 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.140
 I 'm waiting for you in black humor 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.690
 Needless to say, I gil is one of 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 the sons of stephen king so in such a 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.950
 stick like splinter I think it will be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.530
 very well and that they say they are not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.380
 second axis books second 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.780
 I want to read Galician laura yes because no 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 I read laura vallejo 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.069
 well I hope to put a solution very soon 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 with this book where the trees sing 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.970
 is one of his most acclaimed novels 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.610
 known and does not know that everyone 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 I have to do with him 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 it's a fairy tale of princes of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 magic a typical story 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.900
 fantastic not a little sweet that I think 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.140
 Stephanie Moreno from the Temple of the Thousand 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.270
 doors says maidens to the rescue and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.560
 gentlemen in distress an adventure of 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.560
 overcoming and friendship 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.810
 I think I will like laura vallejo 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.600
 at least this novel I hope that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.580
 like it and I really want like 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.200
 third proposal I have the elongated 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.300
 shadow of the love of macÃ­as more ciu follows 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.470
 infarction you can not see 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.200
 well a young man goes suddenly 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.080
 thirty-something is therefore with the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.640
 death of his mother and one day a 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.800
 giant and says yes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.190
 what treats people afflicted with the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.790
 duel and of that moment then fateful not 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.410
 there's enough let's say delicate not when 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.870
 ask someone seems like a novel 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.150
 self-help or something like that is not called the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.140
 attention enough this author has 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.060
 several novels and well this is the one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 I found no closer to me in summer 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.000
 there's more time is supposed to be more time 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.100
 so we can the roughest books 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.580
 as the lord of the rings of tolkien 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.840
 6 a clasicazo that by the way did not do 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.030

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.520

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.890
