00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
here didn't really end up working out

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
here didn't really end up working out
from<00:00:45.600> too<00:00:45.840> much<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.289> unfortunately<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.309> know

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
from too much but unfortunately you know

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
from too much but unfortunately you know
did<00:00:47.670> require<00:00:48.059> some<00:00:48.120> actions<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.200> part<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
did require some actions on my part to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
did require some actions on my part to
keep<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.969> dying<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
keep from dying so I you know at this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
keep from dying so I you know at this
point<00:00:54.809> pretty<00:00:55.410> pretty<00:00:55.829> easy<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
point pretty pretty easy to say that I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
point pretty pretty easy to say that I
did<00:00:56.789> enough<00:00:57.000> damage<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:57.780> says<00:00:57.960> something

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
did enough damage and he says something

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
did enough damage and he says something
in<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> language<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.219> probably<00:00:59.579> fake<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
in a language that is probably fake and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.039 
in a language that is probably fake and
quits<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.859> 37<00:01:02.520> 37<00:01:03.300> 8<00:01:03.539> p.m.<00:01:03.840> but

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
quits and I got I got 37 37 8 p.m. but

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
quits and I got I got 37 37 8 p.m. but
you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.890> definitely<00:01:05.489> could

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you know I think that's definitely could

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
you know I think that's definitely could
be<00:01:06.030> doing<00:01:06.450> better<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> end<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.530> matching

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
be doing better there I end up matching

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
be doing better there I end up matching
him<00:01:08.100> again<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> ladder<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> he<00:01:09.600> tried<00:01:09.869> he<00:01:09.960> says

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
him again on ladder and he tried he says

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.740 
him again on ladder and he tried he says
a<00:01:10.200> Korean<00:01:10.740> slur<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.760> corrects<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a Korean slur but then corrects it and I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.980 
a Korean slur but then corrects it and I
mean<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> game<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> got<00:01:13.590> 15<00:01:14.100> APM<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.990> probably

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
mean that game I got 15 APM but probably

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010

not<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.619> count<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> anyway<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
not gonna count that one but anyway so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
only thing I got lucky with was born
with<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> talent<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.880> perform<00:01:39.299> builds<00:01:39.900> like

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
with the talent to perform builds like

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
with the talent to perform builds like
this<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> his<00:01:41.579> drones<00:01:41.880> are

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this and you know all of his drones are

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
this and you know all of his drones are
dead<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> worked<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.649> well

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
dead and worked out pretty well

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.389 
dead and worked out pretty well
ended<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.490> getting<00:01:44.640> 23<00:01:45.390> APM<00:01:45.840> they're<00:01:46.399> probably

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
ended up getting 23 APM they're probably

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
ended up getting 23 APM they're probably
not<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> best<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.630> maybe<00:01:49.049> could<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.350> doing<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
not the best but maybe could be doing a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
not the best but maybe could be doing a
little<00:01:50.130> bit<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.820> lower<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.299> did

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
little bit get a little bit lower I did

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
little bit get a little bit lower I did
have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> couple<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.040> unnecessary

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have to do a couple of unnecessary

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
have to do a couple of unnecessary
actions<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.540> try<00:01:54.780> another<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:55.259> gate

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
actions there do try another two gate

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.910 
actions there do try another two gate
this<00:01:55.710> time<00:01:55.890> against<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> Terran<00:01:57.920> spoiler
