00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
headphones do not earcups do not swivel

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.390 
headphones do not earcups do not swivel
as<00:02:34.530> much<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.010> these<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.550> our<00:02:36.450> knees<00:02:37.400> see

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
as much as on these and our knees see

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220 
as much as on these and our knees see
these<00:02:38.550> have<00:02:38.730> full<00:02:38.910> 360-degree<00:02:39.450> swivel<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
these have full 360-degree swivel just

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.230 
these have full 360-degree swivel just
like<00:02:40.350> these<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.680> these<00:02:40.800> these<00:02:41.430> only<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.940> up<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
like these in these these only go up and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.390 
like these in these these only go up and
down<00:02:42.860> but<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.400> again<00:02:44.520> these<00:02:45.060> are<00:02:45.120> wireless

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
down but then again these are wireless

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.750 
down but then again these are wireless
so<00:02:47.870> sound<00:02:48.870> quality<00:02:49.700> these<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:52.340> clear<00:02:53.340> sound

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
honestly it's not the best it's like its

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
honestly it's not the best it's like its
