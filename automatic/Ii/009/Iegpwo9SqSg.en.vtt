00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

some<00:00:00.359> time<00:00:00.570> ago<00:00:00.719> you<00:00:00.900> may<00:00:01.170> remember<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:02.040> I

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
some time ago you may remember that I

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.930 
some time ago you may remember that I
made<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.149> silent<00:00:03.750> wooden<00:00:04.529> computer<00:00:05.130> at<00:00:05.670> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
made a silent wooden computer at the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.330 
made a silent wooden computer at the
moment<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.930> process<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.620> making<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
moment I'm in the process of making a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.600 
moment I'm in the process of making a
mark<00:00:08.880> 2<00:00:09.269> version<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.040> I've<00:00:11.040> been<00:00:11.219> doing<00:00:11.429> some

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
mark 2 version and I've been doing some

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.030 
mark 2 version and I've been doing some
experiments<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.929> experiments<00:00:13.769> was

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
experiments one of the experiments was

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.870 
experiments one of the experiments was
to<00:00:14.070> put<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.849> CPU<00:00:15.719> cooler<00:00:16.020> onto<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> graphics<00:00:17.760> card

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to put a CPU cooler onto a graphics card

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.160 
to put a CPU cooler onto a graphics card
and<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.500> what<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.770> looks<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:21.170> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and this is what that looks like as you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.540 
and this is what that looks like as you
can<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:23.340> huge<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.869> comparison<00:00:25.400> this<00:00:26.400> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
can see it's huge in comparison this is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.359 
can see it's huge in comparison this is
a<00:00:26.580> GTX<00:00:27.359> 460<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.890> Asus<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> its

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
a GTX 460 an Asus one and this is its

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.750 
a GTX 460 an Asus one and this is its
old<00:00:32.640> cooler<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.640> there's<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
old cooler as you can see there's a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
old cooler as you can see there's a
considerable<00:00:36.719> difference<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.559> size<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:39.750> for

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
considerable difference in size that for

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.610 
considerable difference in size that for
example<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.040> only<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.520> three<00:00:41.940> heat<00:00:42.210> pipes

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
example has only got three heat pipes

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.470 
example has only got three heat pipes
whereas<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.670> eight<00:00:45.079> it's<00:00:46.079> huge<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
whereas this has got eight it's huge and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.860 
whereas this has got eight it's huge and
the<00:00:48.480> fan<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:50.870> 120

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the fan on here can now be 120

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.760 
the fan on here can now be 120
millimeters<00:00:52.680> rather<00:00:53.100> than<00:00:53.510> about<00:00:54.510> 80<00:00:54.780> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
millimeters rather than about 80 so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.830 
millimeters rather than about 80 so
there'll<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.100> huge<00:00:56.399> difference<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
there'll be a huge difference in the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.529 
there'll be a huge difference in the
silence<00:00:58.800> hopefully<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> cooling

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
silence hopefully and cooling

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.140 
silence hopefully and cooling
performance<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> goal<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.409> for<00:01:05.150> cooler

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
performance so the goal is for cooler

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
performance so the goal is for cooler
temperatures<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.159> quieter<00:01:08.159> slower<00:01:08.670> fan

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
temperatures at quieter slower fan

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990 
temperatures at quieter slower fan
speeds<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:10.680> attached<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> graphics

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
speeds it's attached to the graphics

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.080 
speeds it's attached to the graphics
card<00:01:12.330> using<00:01:12.900> some<00:01:13.380> steel<00:01:13.799> from<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.310> side<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
card using some steel from the side of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.740 
card using some steel from the side of
an<00:01:15.240> old<00:01:15.450> PSU<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.850> holes<00:01:18.240> drilled

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
an old PSU it's just had holes drilled

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.499 
an old PSU it's just had holes drilled
into<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.780> has<00:01:21.780> been<00:01:21.810> screwed

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
into it and it just has been screwed

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
into it and it just has been screwed
down<00:01:24.509> onto<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> board<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.369> simple

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
down onto the board it's really simple

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.020 
down onto the board it's really simple
but<00:01:26.970> works<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:29.030> quite

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
but works well and is actually quite

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.330 
but works well and is actually quite
strong<00:01:30.479> considering<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.770> an<00:01:31.950> official

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
strong considering it's not an official

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.080 
strong considering it's not an official
mount<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> anyway<00:01:35.369> let's<00:01:35.610> hook<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mount for it but anyway let's hook it up

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.600 
mount for it but anyway let's hook it up
to<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.299> computer<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:38.119> see<00:01:39.119> how<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.360> performs

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
to my computer and see how it performs

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
to my computer and see how it performs
okay<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.060> I've<00:01:42.270> plugged<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> graphics

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
okay so now I've plugged the graphics

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
okay so now I've plugged the graphics
card<00:01:43.439> into<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> motherboard<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> see

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
card into the motherboard as you can see

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830 
card into the motherboard as you can see
it's<00:01:45.720> plugged<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.560> using<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.189> PCIe<00:01:47.939> extension

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's plugged in using a PCIe extension

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's plugged in using a PCIe extension
cord<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.990> that's<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.310> CPU<00:01:53.729> cooler

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
cord and that's because the CPU cooler

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.920 
cord and that's because the CPU cooler
is<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.540> big<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.579> expansion<00:01:57.420> slots

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is so big that the expansion slots

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.950 
is so big that the expansion slots
actually<00:01:58.649> prevent<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> graphics<00:01:59.790> card<00:02:00.090> from

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
actually prevent the graphics card from

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
actually prevent the graphics card from
being<00:02:01.350> seated<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
being seated when it's on so it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.620 
being seated when it's on so it's
necessary<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> does<00:02:05.700> perform<00:02:05.939> quite<00:02:06.570> well

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
necessary but it does perform quite well

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.930 
necessary but it does perform quite well
and<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:07.619> aren't<00:02:07.860> any<00:02:08.069> issues<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and there aren't any issues with it so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.240 
and there aren't any issues with it so
that's<00:02:09.060> good

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
that's good

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.460 
that's good
the<00:02:10.910> back<00:02:11.030> here<00:02:11.210> we've<00:02:11.360> got<00:02:11.510> two<00:02:11.750> fans<00:02:11.960> they're

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
the back here we've got two fans they're

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.230 
the back here we've got two fans they're
running<00:02:12.740> at<00:02:12.860> their<00:02:13.040> minimum<00:02:13.550> speed<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
running at their minimum speed at the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.620 
running at their minimum speed at the
moment<00:02:14.570> using<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.020> fan<00:02:15.350> control<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.630> this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
moment using this fan control and this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.960 
moment using this fan control and this
one's<00:02:17.870> blowing<00:02:18.350> air<00:02:18.680> into<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.340> CPU<00:02:19.730> core

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
one's blowing air into the CPU core

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.940 
one's blowing air into the CPU core
making<00:02:20.690> sure<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> core<00:02:21.410> temperature

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
making sure that the core temperature

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.200 
making sure that the core temperature
remains<00:02:22.280> low<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:24.050> one<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:25.670> blowing

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
remains low and this one is just blowing

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.960 
remains low and this one is just blowing
onto<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> voltage<00:02:27.170> regulators<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.130> onto<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.880 
RAM currently there are no heat sinks on
the<00:02:31.700> RAM<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.340> that's<00:02:34.340> something<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.970> add<00:02:35.120> later

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the RAM so that's something to add later

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.360 
the RAM so that's something to add later
if<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.310> experiment<00:02:38.030> goes<00:02:38.180> well<00:02:39.100> as<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.250> can

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
if this experiment goes well as you can

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.530 
if this experiment goes well as you can
hear<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.730> very<00:02:40.910> quiet<00:02:41.210> and<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.910> fans<00:02:44.270> are

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
hear it's very quiet and the fans are

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.750 
hear it's very quiet and the fans are
actually<00:02:45.260> running<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.680> there<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.070> speed<00:02:46.460> as<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
actually running it there so speed as I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.330 
actually running it there so speed as I
said<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:47.960> can't<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.680> hear<00:02:48.980> them<00:02:49.130> I<00:02:49.220> can

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
said and I can't really hear them I can

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.860 
said and I can't really hear them I can
hear<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.640> hard<00:02:49.850> drives<00:02:50.180> over<00:02:50.480> here

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
hear the hard drives over here

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.990 
hear the hard drives over here
more<00:02:51.080> than<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.290> can<00:02:51.350> hear<00:02:51.620> these<00:02:51.770> fans<00:02:52.100> so

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
more than I can hear these fans so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.580 
more than I can hear these fans so
they're<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.450> limiter<00:02:53.900> at<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.110> moment<00:02:54.410> rather

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
they're the limiter at the moment rather

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.070 
they're the limiter at the moment rather
than<00:02:54.860> graphics<00:02:55.340> card<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.570> might<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:56.930> be

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
than graphics card and that might not be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.750 
than graphics card and that might not be
so<00:02:57.860> amazing<00:02:58.310> if<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.900> weren't<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.620> fir<00:03:01.400> mark

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so amazing if it weren't that fir mark

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.700 
so amazing if it weren't that fir mark
was<00:03:02.210> maxing<00:03:02.870> out<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.140> graphics<00:03:03.500> card

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
was maxing out the graphics card

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.230 
was maxing out the graphics card
currently<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> graphics<00:03:04.760> card<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.090> actually

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
currently the graphics card is actually

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.090 
currently the graphics card is actually
maxed<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:07.240> making<00:03:08.240> hardly<00:03:08.690> any<00:03:08.810> noise

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
maxed out with making hardly any noise

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.910 
maxed out with making hardly any noise
which<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.360> amazing<00:03:11.390> okay<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.200> we're<00:03:12.590> four

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
which is amazing okay so we're four

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.220 
which is amazing okay so we're four
minutes<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.570> see<00:03:14.630> it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
minutes in now and as you can see it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.180 
minutes in now and as you can see it
rose<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.980> peak<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.940> about<00:03:17.330> 60<00:03:17.930> Celsius<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
rose to a peak of about 60 Celsius and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.220 
rose to a peak of about 60 Celsius and
then<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.489> open<00:03:19.730> my<00:03:19.850> window<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.750> gone<00:03:20.930> down

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
then I open my window and it's gone down

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.280 
then I open my window and it's gone down
a<00:03:21.530> few<00:03:21.830> degrees<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.670> about<00:03:22.790> 58<00:03:23.330> Celsius<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.170> it

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
a few degrees to about 58 Celsius and it

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.699 
a few degrees to about 58 Celsius and it
seems<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.709> be<00:03:24.920> running<00:03:25.880> stable<00:03:26.780> at<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.410> now

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
seems to be running stable at that now

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.120 
seems to be running stable at that now
and<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:29.570> temperatures<00:03:30.110> in<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.620> room<00:03:30.830> is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
and the temperatures in the room is

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.000 
and the temperatures in the room is
pretty<00:03:31.459> hot<00:03:31.640> in<00:03:31.820> here<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.180> think<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:32.720> about<00:03:33.010> 23

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
pretty hot in here I think it's about 23

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.140 
pretty hot in here I think it's about 23
degrees<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> considering<00:03:37.190> these<00:03:37.310> fans<00:03:37.700> are

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
degrees so considering these fans are

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.910 
degrees so considering these fans are
inaudible<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.160> an<00:03:40.489> amazing<00:03:41.920> performance

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
inaudible that is an amazing performance

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.500 
inaudible that is an amazing performance
that's<00:03:43.610> just<00:03:44.030> amazing

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
that's just amazing

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.620 
that's just amazing
I<00:03:44.660> mean<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.959> can't<00:03:45.200> hear<00:03:45.380> this<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:46.630> whereas

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
I mean I can't hear this now whereas

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.759 
I mean I can't hear this now whereas
before<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.830> old<00:03:49.010> stock<00:03:49.519> cooler<00:03:50.769> it

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
before with the old stock cooler it

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.110 
before with the old stock cooler it
would<00:03:51.920> be<00:03:52.070> whining<00:03:52.400> quite<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.030> lot<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.810> fan<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
would be whining quite a lot the fan and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.630 
would be whining quite a lot the fan and
if<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.450> temperatures<00:03:56.959> would<00:03:57.260> be<00:03:57.530> about<00:04:00.640> about

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
if the temperatures would be about about

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.960 
if the temperatures would be about about
10<00:04:01.940> Celsius<00:04:02.269> higher<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.590> it's<00:04:04.280> doing<00:04:04.580> its<00:04:04.730> job

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
10 Celsius higher so it's doing its job

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.960 
10 Celsius higher so it's doing its job
quite<00:04:05.239> well<00:04:05.920> okay<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:06.980> one<00:04:07.250> last<00:04:07.430> thing<00:04:07.790> we'll

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
quite well okay so one last thing we'll

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.650 
quite well okay so one last thing we'll
do<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.420> just<00:04:08.920> increase<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.670> fan<00:04:11.000> speed<00:04:11.330> to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
do is just increase the fan speed to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.110 
do is just increase the fan speed to
maximum<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.950> both<00:04:13.190> will<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.519> running<00:04:13.730> at<00:04:13.910> full

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
maximum so both will be running at full

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.150 
maximum so both will be running at full
speed<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:15.200> see<00:04:15.320> what<00:04:15.500> temperature's<00:04:16.010> we

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
speed and just see what temperature's we

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.140 
speed and just see what temperature's we
get<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:17.390> just<00:04:17.840> increase<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:19.310> fan<00:04:19.489> speeds

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
get so just increase the fan speeds

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.790 
get so just increase the fan speeds
so<00:04:22.150> as<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.449> hear<00:04:22.690> it's<00:04:22.810> considerably

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
so as you can hear it's considerably

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.610 
so as you can hear it's considerably
louder<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:25.690> let's<00:04:25.840> just<00:04:26.020> watch<00:04:26.410> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
louder but let's just watch the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.409 
louder but let's just watch the
temperatures<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.220> see<00:04:27.370> what<00:04:27.520> happens<00:04:27.790> so

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.060 

temperatures<00:04:31.419> seem<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.930> have<00:04:32.139> stabilized<00:04:32.740> at

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
temperatures seem to have stabilized at

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.189 
temperatures seem to have stabilized at
about<00:04:33.370> 50<00:04:34.330> warn<00:04:34.900> Celsius<00:04:35.470> which<00:04:35.889> is<00:04:36.479> about<00:04:37.479> 20

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
about 50 warn Celsius which is about 20

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.670 
about 50 warn Celsius which is about 20
Celsius<00:04:38.520> cooler<00:04:39.520> than<00:04:40.300> when<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:41.050> graphics

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
Celsius cooler than when the graphics

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.210 
Celsius cooler than when the graphics
card<00:04:41.949> had<00:04:42.220> its<00:04:42.430> original<00:04:43.060> cooler<00:04:43.330> on<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.220> had

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
card had its original cooler on and had

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.800 
card had its original cooler on and had
about<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> same<00:04:45.760> amount<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.180> noise<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:46.600> that's

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
about the same amount of noise so that's

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.450 
about the same amount of noise so that's
a<00:04:46.930> really<00:04:47.380> really<00:04:47.410> impressive<00:04:48.130> result<00:04:48.960> so

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
a really really impressive result so

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.680 
a really really impressive result so
technically<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.580> could<00:04:51.820> probably<00:04:52.000> get<00:04:52.449> a

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
technically I could probably get a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.500 
technically I could probably get a
faster<00:04:53.260> overclock<00:04:53.979> but<00:04:54.460> I'm<00:04:54.610> not<00:04:54.789> really<00:04:55.300> an

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
faster overclock but I'm not really an

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.689 
faster overclock but I'm not really an
ever<00:04:55.690> clocking<00:04:56.080> guy<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:57.250> just<00:04:57.520> want

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
ever clocking guy and I just want

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.810 
ever clocking guy and I just want
silence<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:58.740> hopefully<00:04:59.740> this<00:04:59.919> method<00:05:00.550> will

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
silence so hopefully this method will

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.689 
silence so hopefully this method will
allow<00:05:01.030> me<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.539> achieve<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.699> I'll

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
allow me to achieve that and I'll

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.600 
allow me to achieve that and I'll
probably<00:05:03.910> make<00:05:04.150> another<00:05:04.210> video<00:05:04.740> when<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.949> have

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
probably make another video when I have

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.779 
probably make another video when I have
made<00:05:06.910> some<00:05:07.150> more<00:05:07.300> progress<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.620> subscribe<00:05:09.580> if

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789

made some more progress so subscribe if
you're<00:05:09.970> interested<00:05:10.449> and<00:05:10.570> I'll<00:05:11.380> see<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.830> next
