the United States and move on a 24 hour

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.460 
the United States and move on a 24 hour
clock<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.240> synchronized<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:19.050> us

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
clock so it's not synchronized with us

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.520 
clock so it's not synchronized with us
no<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.190> our<00:03:20.490> like<00:03:21.150> an<00:03:21.510> hour<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:22.110> Canadian

time actually has like 65 American
minutes<00:03:25.710> so<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.040> problem<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.580> using<00:03:26.940> American

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330

forced to drill into the heads from
behind<00:05:32.060> what<00:05:32.419> do<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:32.509> think<00:05:32.720> I<00:05:33.050> think

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
behind what do you think I think

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.909 
behind what do you think I think
probably<00:05:34.400> from<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.270> back<00:05:35.509> I<00:05:35.990> think<00:05:36.680> from<00:05:36.830> the

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
probably from the back I think from the

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.010 
probably from the back I think from the
back<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.280> mountain<00:05:37.550> why<00:05:37.729> mess<00:05:38.000> up<00:05:38.180> you<00:05:38.930> know

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
back the mountain why mess up you know

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.110 
back the mountain why mess up you know
this<00:05:39.199> is<00:05:39.349> a<00:05:39.410> National<00:05:39.800> Monument<00:05:39.919> choose<00:05:40.789> the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
this is a National Monument choose the

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.240 
this is a National Monument choose the
course<00:05:41.360> which<00:05:41.690> has<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.110> least<00:05:42.319> impact<00:05:42.740> on<00:05:43.039> the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
course which has the least impact on the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.760 
course which has the least impact on the
environment<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:44.479> if<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:45.139> involves<00:05:45.440> the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
environment and if that involves the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.170 
environment and if that involves the
precision<00:05:46.220> blasting<00:05:46.669> which<00:05:46.789> it<00:05:46.940> should<00:05:47.150> I

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
precision blasting which it should I

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.480 
precision blasting which it should I
think<00:05:47.509> that's<00:05:47.690> probably<00:05:48.229> okay<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.310> do<00:05:49.400> you

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
think that's probably okay so do you

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.710 
think that's probably okay so do you
think<00:05:49.550> they<00:05:49.789> should<00:05:49.819> be<00:05:50.030> forced<00:05:50.270> even<00:05:50.509> though

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
think they should be forced even though

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.969 
think they should be forced even though
it's<00:05:50.870> more<00:05:50.990> expensive<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.440> drill<00:05:51.650> into<00:05:51.889> the

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
it's more expensive to drill into the
