00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
put him in a try line and that that's

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.260

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
in a try rain with help of good supers

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.020 
in a try rain with help of good supers
tune<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.290> killers<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.920> witch<00:01:53.460> doctor<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
tune up killers like witch doctor and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
tune up killers like witch doctor and
earth<00:01:54.840> shaker<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.650> let<00:01:56.460> him<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> kill

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
earth shaker and let him get the kill

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
earth shaker and let him get the kill
every<00:01:58.140> time<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:02:00.320> our<00:02:01.320> shaker<00:02:01.710> has

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
every time as you can see our shaker has

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
every time as you can see our shaker has
one<00:02:02.160> keel<00:02:02.400> witch<00:02:02.790> doctor<00:02:03.180> has<00:02:03.300> one<00:02:03.450> kill<00:02:03.660> but

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
one keel witch doctor has one kill but

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.320 
one keel witch doctor has one kill but
he<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.020> tweaked<00:02:04.410> heals<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.370> guess<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.000> they

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
he has tweaked heals and I guess if they

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.510 
he has tweaked heals and I guess if they
could<00:02:06.600> choose<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.230> would<00:02:07.410> put<00:02:07.620> just<00:02:08.100> five

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
could choose they would put just five

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
could choose they would put just five
kills<00:02:08.880> on<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.390> morphling<00:02:09.960> and<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:13.230> can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
kills on this morphling and so you can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.360 
kills on this morphling and so you can
get<00:02:13.530> very<00:02:13.860> easily<00:02:14.570> fed<00:02:15.570> at<00:02:15.900> start<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.710> then<00:02:16.890> he

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
get very easily fed at start and then he

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.560 
get very easily fed at start and then he
because<00:02:18.440> FK<00:02:19.440> farming<00:02:19.920> til<00:02:20.100> he<00:02:20.190> gets<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
because FK farming til he gets the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.870 
because FK farming til he gets the
Lincoln<00:02:22.350> sphere<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.370> he<00:02:23.460> goes<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.850> with

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
Lincoln sphere and then he goes on with

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.500 
Lincoln sphere and then he goes on with
just<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.110> lane<00:02:25.350> pushing<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.880> towers

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
just one lane pushing to the towers

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930 
just one lane pushing to the towers
because<00:02:27.870> he's<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.920> Lincoln<00:02:29.340> sphere<00:02:29.610> or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
because he's with Lincoln sphere or

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.810 
because he's with Lincoln sphere or
replicate<00:02:30.450> morph<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:32.220> becomes<00:02:32.550> pretty

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
replicate morph it becomes pretty

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.640 
replicate morph it becomes pretty
unkillable<00:02:33.209> unless<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.959> gank<00:02:34.140> him<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.470> like

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
unkillable unless you gank him with like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.580 
unkillable unless you gank him with like

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
three or four man gang but all the rest

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.530 
three or four man gang but all the rest
of<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> team<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.220> gonna<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.520> big<00:02:38.910> party<00:02:39.390> if

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
of the team is gonna have big party if

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.590 
of the team is gonna have big party if
you<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.730> most<00:02:41.730> teams<00:02:41.940> don't<00:02:42.239> do<00:02:42.390> that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
you do that so most teams don't do that

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.030 
you do that so most teams don't do that
and<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.070> morphling<00:02:45.410> trust<00:02:46.410> strategy

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and this is the morphling trust strategy

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.010 
and this is the morphling trust strategy
I<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.940> much<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:50.480> yeah<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.750> only

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.310 
2500 I which was kind of I won't say old
but<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.750> mean<00:02:58.730> being<00:02:59.730> out<00:02:59.940> farm<00:03:00.300> by<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.570> master

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
but I mean being out farm by the master

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.600 
but I mean being out farm by the master
and<00:03:01.620> not<00:03:02.310> getting<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.120> much<00:03:03.330> far<00:03:04.430> he's<00:03:05.430> not

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
and not getting so much far he's not

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.000 
and not getting so much far he's not
good<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:05.940> 25<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.750> still<00:03:07.110> pretty<00:03:07.350> respectable

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
good but 25 is still pretty respectable

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.860 
good but 25 is still pretty respectable
and<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:09.209> guess<00:03:09.450> she's<00:03:09.720> gonna<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:11.600> kind<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.690> fat

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
and I guess she's gonna get kind of fat

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
and I guess she's gonna get kind of fat
later<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.530> III<00:03:13.920> don't<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.459> don't<00:03:14.610> know

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
later on but III don't know I don't know

surviving is dominating swig and that
will<00:07:11.000> be<00:07:11.150> a<00:07:11.180> problem<00:07:11.480> later<00:07:11.900> on

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.540
