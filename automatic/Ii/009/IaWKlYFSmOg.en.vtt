00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.040
 he yes so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 highly 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480
 I will say that he is very perfect 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.219
 very reliable on 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.720
 southern just exactly right 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.640
 enjoy here i am now 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.039
 step by step we first one speed 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.220
 somebody else then and everything on acceleration 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.820
 you just show the principle here once hit 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.589
 Inspection and disassembly speed she then 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.150
 and then you secretly that is 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.460
 Colonel like his work with him 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.110
 talk and that's when i take 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.070
 a gun and a girasole will take and vuitton 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:46.460
 where I have already gone, I give it once without checking 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:50.510
 chamber while work is slow 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.199
 worked means we have a 4s result 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.370
 full of seconds 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.800
 disassembly-assembly I took the gun pulled 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.930
 the store took off the fuse checked 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.289
 the presence of the cartridge in the chamber took off 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.429
 shutter put you 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.740
 put a spring between the shutter and 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.320
 store put the trigger guard 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.509
 put my gun in its place 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.210
 neatly lies why spring 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.310
 put in the center because sometimes the table 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.899
 it turns out with a tilt and spring just 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.959
 rolls down so she doesn't fall 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.190
 we put after that we do such 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.679
 movement take a spring 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.340
 do not rush to work look spring 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.500
 this side because she is here a little bit 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.349
 the diameter is not different i look like 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.300
 I put on a spring 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:40.099
 or just keep the gun on not myself 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:48.130
 after that in one motion 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:52.190
 lowered the bracket one-two-three-four 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 there is a sports disassembly again draw 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.789
 attention this is done without ammunition on 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.530
 competitions at all events who 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.360
 faster there is a very great speed 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.840
 big and we therefore try the chamber 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.619
 don't even look 1 2 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.340
 threw without looking poked clothed request 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.340
 look 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.820
 all now now I have been interrupted once 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:32.870
 touched look and here someone slapped 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:44.720
 constipated and come across on this river movement 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:47.840
 and on the table and will not always agree 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.960
 dollars are not always imposed as working time 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.240
 let you down after 3 times since removed I can 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.850
 immediately remove the spring and then beat off 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.010
 here we will do an exercise called power 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.300
 as it were on the couch and the shutter is a taurasi 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.980
 on which everyone comes across 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.890
 look carefully here I led 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.900
 shutter his like the top while slammed 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.750
 once again draw your attention as we 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.350
 I work slowly but once 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:22.220
 slammed shut and so did i take 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.890
 recount one two three and removed if necessary i 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.720
 I take the shutter then the cancer the nearer my hands 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.340
 This place is more convenient for the body to work on 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.150
 outstretched hands work extremely uncomfortable 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 want is already possible and
