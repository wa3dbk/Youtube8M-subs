00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.069
 the pitfalls of creating a model 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.909
 miniaturize 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.560
 if you simply divide everything by the scale in which you die then you can 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.569
 best that the model is not at all or they work richly 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.589
 it has to do with the thickness of the chimneys 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.809
 etc. must not be forgotten 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.410
 stand on a platform and we see a train 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370
 then we look at counter bottom to bottom 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.390
 you view a model from top to bottom 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.810
 that gives a very different effect to Coptic 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.520
 that also applies to color 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 the very big pitfall is the color 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 colors on a model 7 slightly lighter than those in reality 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.250
 in reality, we view the model's daily victory 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.630
 a train closed the day 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.470
 and you usually view a model in artificial light 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.470
 there is always something dark 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
 debt 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.550
 the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.410
 the cyclist miniatures for this yes you do 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.300
 or that the dish compared to the designer of the real trend 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.230
 that I actually do not know that for making the option it is one 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.820
 major problems with him 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 and the sixteen hundred it is also not something you do 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.590
 A number of cities argued in the station 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.359
 and experienced certain cities that did not want or against hefty payment 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.549
 that their no go was used on a model friedrich 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.659
 the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 6 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.859
 they sent the establishment of 4 percent yes we request from customers to find in 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.189
 the position 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.199
 per day 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.439
 that was to stop with the 37 37 and to experience 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.789
 stencil were yesterday when stennis prefers to hand out 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.329
 whether people were interested in one by one model 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.639
 that was the start and slowly but surely build up in a clientele 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.920
 you are now not staring at around three thousand people 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.209
 a year earlier 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.789
 7 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:37.019
 goods 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 we have a lot 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.779
 neither 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.939
 the top years the sports council talking about the 59th to 19 59 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.369
 we worked with nine people 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.779
 unimaginable 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.949
 nine people make trains all day 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.719
 the people who were working now had some catch 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 the background in brussels and paris 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.039
 it often to clear the hilversum model 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.400
 the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 but on 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:17.910
 Haarlem 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.910
 hahaha 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.439
 New York 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.090
 Haarlem 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.090
 can not we 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.509
 farrar 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.059
 the benefit 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.979
 said to be made 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.879
 a nice folder 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.099
 and who thought that I am going to send you 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.460
 nowadays of course 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.809
 it also goes via the internet 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.990
 Then you wait how the response of the customers 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.470
 some things become nothing other things become a great performance 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.219
 to do the sale 125 grams 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.459
 if there are too few tenderers then the project simply does not work 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.300
 though the preparations that have been made up to that time have to be refreshed yes 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.110
 I decide the field 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.110
 sometimes I try again much later and yes 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:53.069
 I only mention what 9 the pond mountain percent in 2010, it can of course be a huge gap 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.819
 sit and then the mentality may have totally changed the human being maybe you have 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.990
 your computer games and they returned 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.990
 the trains ever 

00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:57.309
