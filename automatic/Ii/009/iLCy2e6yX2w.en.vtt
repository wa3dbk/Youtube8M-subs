00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
again just take a guess here let's say

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.429 
again just take a guess here let's say
it<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:03.180> Calvin<00:02:03.630> Coolidge<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.399 
you can see I was wrong so you can see
that<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> actual<00:02:06.420> answer<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.990> Woodrow

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that the actual answer was Woodrow

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
a total of ten questions so we'll see

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.170 
a total of ten questions so we'll see
here<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.950> socials<00:02:41.609> from<00:02:41.819> civil<00:02:42.120> rights
