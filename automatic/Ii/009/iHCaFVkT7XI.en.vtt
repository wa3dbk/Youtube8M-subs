00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.980

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.830 
usually soak my nails for about 10 to 15
minutes<00:01:23.940> make<00:01:24.940> sure<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.240> wash<00:01:25.420> your<00:01:25.600> hands

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
minutes make sure you wash your hands

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.330 
minutes make sure you wash your hands
after<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.229> do<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:26.619> soak<00:01:26.860> because<00:01:27.220> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
after you do this soak because the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.499 
after you do this soak because the
baking<00:01:27.700> soda<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.210> leave<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.420> residue<00:01:30.300> now<00:01:31.300> that

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
baking soda can leave a residue now that

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.540 
baking soda can leave a residue now that
my<00:01:31.660> nails<00:01:31.869> are<00:01:32.050> squeaky<00:01:32.470> clean<00:01:32.650> it's<00:01:33.070> time<00:01:33.340> to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
my nails are squeaky clean it's time to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.820 
my nails are squeaky clean it's time to
shape<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.060> trim<00:01:34.270> them<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.720> always<00:01:35.229> just<00:01:35.590> use<00:01:35.800> a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
shape and trim them I always just use a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.680 
shape and trim them I always just use a
crystal<00:01:36.220> nail<00:01:36.520> file<00:01:36.729> because<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.240> grid<00:01:37.570> is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
crystal nail file because the grid is

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.740 
crystal nail file because the grid is
much<00:01:37.930> finer<00:01:38.289> so<00:01:38.649> it's<00:01:38.800> easier<00:01:39.160> on<00:01:39.250> your<00:01:39.399> nails

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
much finer so it's easier on your nails

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.240 
much finer so it's easier on your nails
sometimes<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:40.930> my<00:01:41.080> nails<00:01:41.229> are<00:01:41.410> really<00:01:41.440> flaky<00:01:41.890> I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
sometimes if my nails are really flaky I

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.770 
sometimes if my nails are really flaky I
buff<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.789> tips<00:01:43.030> but<00:01:43.330> just<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.690> little<00:01:43.960> bit
