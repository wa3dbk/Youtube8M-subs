00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.150
 there is 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770
 good morning we are on important channel e 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.600
 we are in the company of luca praga who 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 today he will explain something quite a bit 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.670
 interesting for all of you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.830
 hi to all as you will know from some 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.590
 week snapshots are available 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.000
 of the 1.5 minecraft with this 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.580
 learned new ones were introduced 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
 features that will allow you to create 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.110
 increasingly advanced circuits as it seems 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 nothing in this case what we have 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 in front of a proximity sensor 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.640
 completely intelligent and above all 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.800
 very small and compact 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.200
 before this version to do a 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 sense of proximity needed to be resorted to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.180
 a work around type use a village 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.119
 or a spoiler of a village or 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.340
 even pigs but it was stuff 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.530
 complicated and in any case not usable 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.270
 this system among other things there 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 will allow you to create a bomb 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.300
 completely identifiable 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.410
 completely impossible to defuse e 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.440
 we'll show it later 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.690
 meanwhile I will explain briefly how it works 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.980
 a proximity sensor built of the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.120
 1.5 the heart of all this and koman 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.229
 bloc that is activated continuously by 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.479
 this repeater says about the qik you see 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.640
 that you are seeing will check there are 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.710
 player within five blocks if 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.130
 there are the comparator attached 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.380
 now it will activate or any block that 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.180
 support of near destiny for institutions 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.660
 which now as you can see maker il 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 radius I enter and c not enter 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.680
 a ray 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.170
 the block turns on neo vesco is that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.420
 turning off may seem like a thing 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 stupid but as I will explain you soon 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.820
 you can do things like a bomb 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.190
 really impossible to see 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.709
 though that if you are not opi and you are not in 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.350
 creative you can't do all that for 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.820
 which we say is a comfortable thing all 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.900
 a guest server and you want or 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.010
 protect the area or entertain pictorial 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.670
 let's move on to the other island that I explain to you 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.330
 as this day is a step 1 place 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.890
 two repeaters remain one front 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.690
 respect where 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.160
 it's last on the other side like I did 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.750
 now see 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.290
 after that of the part where you have less 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.770
 space while the two blocks 22 rail 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.320
 standard after which on the other side in the 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.380
 in front of the repeater pointing towards 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.640
 north of you place the command 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.030
 block and put this command into it 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.680
 here a great that I could not see 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.590
 I can't explain my screen 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.230
 here is the command sign that it will be in 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.650
 description together with the link of the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.650
 snap shot 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 Here you can read here is serene and crowe 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.410
 spiral painting p which means al 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.970
 nearest player open square e 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.450
 those are the coach's topics 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.209
 crotti 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.480
 in this case r means radius and di 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.209
 the one in the room where yours 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.550
 ir sensor to the player before had been on 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.959
 five so that it was exactly in 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.060
 that red ray now continuing 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.900
 after which the squares of the firestone date 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.030
 wine at the command full circuit blocks and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.130
 activate this little circuit put 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.109
 a torch for half a second so 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.510
 look at it can be a lot though 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.190
 see your friends doing it so you do 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.800
 see keep yourself 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.390
 here is why i am we in 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.520
 multiplayer and maybe not with the lake 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:38.310
 He understands faster 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:40.440
 put here faster here then ok 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.850
 let's pretend that you understand they pass 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.630
 again be really quick of 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.630
 hand me the torch 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:55.610
 look so real self is the fastest 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.039
 then take a comparator 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.750
 if you didn't know buyers are a 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.039
 new type of ciro components of 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.300
 circuit of their 1.5 purpose is true 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.330
 so big that I could never 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.580
 explain it to you without checking from vinci 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.740
 clearly explained in this case it 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.120
 we will use to check that command 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.860
 that we gave the command block yes 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.270
 performed correctly as you can 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.099
 see having a player in range on 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.810
 comparator is activated 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.330
 as soon as we enter and barely felt 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.370
 we go out if not I was attacking one 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.430
 any component that uses the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:43.729
 make this will activate not block 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.620
 piston another piston be 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.539
 imaginative and it is the tnt 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.500
 yes because with this you also do us the 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:54.560
 traps here where sooner or later must 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.659
 blow up and that 's how you can 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.990
 therefore we cannot redo the china 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.819
 this is the good one for strength is true is 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.650
 good for strength 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.879
 here is how I was saying we can 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.979
 make bombs in the vicinity how to do it 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.800
 simply do it again 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.839
 we have done so far and that happens 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.909
 chinetti like I did though how 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:20.599
 have you noticed if I build it while 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:23.240
 i'm close that bursts is a bit 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.729
 useless the trick where you have to 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.960
 find a way not to burst it 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.940
 while you are close 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.050
 the easiest method is that anyway 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.879
 area works better or less with everyone e 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.550
 the limit the tnt to a block of 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:43.539
 distance as now activate all the 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.539
 circuit waits for it to touch the command 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:56.659
 let's put this cube here and see how it is 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.550
 useless look rather here otherwise 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.750
 they lose what I am explaining and how 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.750
 you can see the
