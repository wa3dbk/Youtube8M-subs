00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.520
 doing bodybuilding without exercises 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.260
 aerobics you can if the bodybuilding 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.119
 increasing your muscle mass is a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 activity that has a caloric expenditure 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 obviously contributing to growth will 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
 Defend clear of calorie consumption 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780

 best exercise is 13 years good 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 next 13 years the very same is you 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 play to participate in games to learn 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.510
 leaf basketball finally more activities is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 out of the gym environment is each 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 difficult if you opt for a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 gym no problem 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 try exercising with less 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
 intensity 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.250
 respond is coercion less load more 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 repetitions are fine since hours later 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 50 years 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 What is the best way to get into the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 I work out all the gyms I tried not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.770
 have a university program - always 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.549
 sore a chance to work out a problem 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.740
 age is not it is not 50 years you 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 can start at age 60 you can 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 to start is in the academies you need 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.909
 an orientation that I do not want to put you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 in focus one day then what do you have? 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 happened to you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.189
 is a lot of exercise 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 greater than its capacity in that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.970
 When you get sore 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.549
 You become discouraged and end up giving up. 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.189
 so ideal for those who are 50 to 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 who has 20 for who has 30% in 70 is 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.820
 respect the current level of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.920
 air conditioning conditioning 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
 slowly starts to be important. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 regularity one time you win 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 conditioning that increases the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.250
 load without wanting to get in shape of the day 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.409
 to night 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.600
 larissa kleine 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.119
 now the training agrees ideally on a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.030
 week from the time how many calories 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.209
 I lose a friend, my father lost 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.720
 20 pounds jumping five minutes 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.510
 Corneal poetry proceeds may have lost 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.940
 but you can be sure that the rope helped 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.319
 it certainly decreases the amount of 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 calories, right? 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.870
 if you're going to skip half an hour rope 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.569
 a lot of things are not easy to keep 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.360
 300 to 400 calories in this 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.840
 half an hour but you lose 20 pounds 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.599
 so obviously entered an amount to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.730
 calorie reduction power id 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.470
 thinking with friends or boss only five 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.680
 minutes but five minutes is a good 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.360
 exercise you have a caloric burn 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.269
 even interesting because the rope is 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.670
 a very intense activity but can 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.349
 to be sure these were not five 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.329
 minutes and core that no longer lose if 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.180
 feel that there is a color set of the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.730
 Islam found atala was the average of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.480
 calories spent in an hour of goose 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.620
 depends on the dance if waltz bolero goes 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.049
 losing with a dance is more intense goes 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.139
 lose another hour of a dance a lot 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.139
 intensity can lose there 400 to 500 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.359
 calories says one more thing to slow down 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.919
 up to 200 250 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.680
 if you need a tip and 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:27.560
