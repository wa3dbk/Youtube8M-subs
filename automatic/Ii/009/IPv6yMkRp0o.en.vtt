okay<00:00:02.850> so<00:00:03.740> Steve<00:00:04.740> came<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.130> me<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> while<00:00:05.700> ago

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
okay so Steve came to me a while ago

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.810 
okay so Steve came to me a while ago
with<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.540> idea<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.109> build<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:07.830> apple<00:00:08.189> Strider<00:00:08.490> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
with an idea to build an apple Strider I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790 
with an idea to build an apple Strider I
didn't<00:00:09.480> know<00:00:09.570> what<00:00:09.719> what<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> hell<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.650> was

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
didn't know what what the hell and I was

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.400 
didn't know what what the hell and I was
glad<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> time<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.599> he<00:00:13.019> explained

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
glad it was at the time but he explained

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.890 
glad it was at the time but he explained
to<00:00:13.500> me<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.009> basically<00:00:14.549> our<00:00:14.670> idea<00:00:15.179> started

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
to me and basically our idea started

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.980 
to me and basically our idea started
with<00:00:15.960> two<00:00:16.260> counter-rotating<00:00:16.710> drums<00:00:17.869> but<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
with two counter-rotating drums but the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.330 
with two counter-rotating drums but the
only<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.770> way<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.980> had<00:00:20.130> originally

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
only thing is the way we had originally

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.790 
only thing is the way we had originally
designed<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.119> too<00:00:21.270> big<00:00:21.539> gears<00:00:21.900> unfortunately

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
designed was too big gears unfortunately

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160 
designed was too big gears unfortunately
you<00:00:22.859> can't<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.250> them<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.880> decent<00:00:24.720> price<00:00:24.930> so

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
you can't get them for a decent price so

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.300 
you can't get them for a decent price so
we<00:00:25.289> went<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> chain<00:00:25.830> drive<00:00:26.099> which<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
we went to the chain drive which is a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
we went to the chain drive which is a
lot<00:00:26.460> cheaper<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.970> twice<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.449> complex<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
lot cheaper but twice as complex so in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.769 
lot cheaper but twice as complex so in
order<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.670> shafts<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.390> rotate

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
order to get the shafts to rotate

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.260 
order to get the shafts to rotate
counterclockwise<00:00:31.369> we<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.730> run<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> chain

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
counterclockwise we had to run the chain

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.380 
counterclockwise we had to run the chain
like<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.100> idler<00:00:35.460> well

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
like you see here with an idler well

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.880 
like you see here with an idler well
actually<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.809> an<00:00:36.899> adjustment<00:00:37.230> our<00:00:37.469> man<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
actually with an adjustment our man and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.709 
actually with an adjustment our man and
I<00:00:37.950> learned<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.910> our<00:00:39.000> tension<00:00:39.270> I'll<00:00:39.540> figure

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I learned to get our tension I'll figure

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
I learned to get our tension I'll figure
it<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.050> everything<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> other<00:00:41.430> side

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it out and everything on the other side

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
it out and everything on the other side
we<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> belt<00:00:43.020> drive<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.590> simple<00:00:43.920> belt

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we have a belt drive really simple belt

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.630 
we have a belt drive really simple belt
drive<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:45.149> three<00:00:45.360> gear<00:00:45.719> ratio<00:00:46.610> with<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
drive one two three gear ratio with a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.500 
drive one two three gear ratio with a
spring<00:00:48.300> clutch<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.120> we<00:00:51.120> based<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
spring clutch on it and we based this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.810 
spring clutch on it and we based this
you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.260> mounted<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> square<00:00:53.579> got

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you know mounted all up got a square got

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
you know mounted all up got a square got
it<00:00:53.940> running<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.230> screws<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.680> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it running put some screws in it for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.630 
it running put some screws in it for
some<00:00:56.039> teeth<00:00:56.840> bent<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.289> side<00:00:59.129> plates<00:00:59.430> at

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
some teeth bent up the side plates at

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
some teeth bent up the side plates at
work<00:01:00.859> basically<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> made<00:01:02.789> of

yeah the rest we just basically scrounge
and<00:01:14.729> found<00:01:14.939> around<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> motors<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
and found around the motors off like a

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.840 
and found around the motors off like a
nineteen<00:01:17.720> table<00:01:18.720> foot<00:01:19.070> 1956<00:01:20.070> table<00:01:20.610> saw<00:01:20.820> or

nineteen table foot 1956 table saw or

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
nineteen table foot 1956 table saw or
something<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.979> yeah<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> machining<00:01:23.820> was

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
something so yeah all the machining was

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.510 
something so yeah all the machining was
done<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> basement<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.930> home<00:01:25.280> using<00:01:26.280> early

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
done in the basement at home using early

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
done in the basement at home using early
rudimentary<00:01:27.110> methods<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.009> drill

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
rudimentary methods and you know drill

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
rudimentary methods and you know drill
in<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.670> file<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.470> put<00:01:31.470> how<00:01:31.799> many<00:01:31.979> necks<00:01:32.159> maybe

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
in a file and put how many necks maybe

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520 
in a file and put how many necks maybe
four<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.729> five<00:01:32.820> nights<00:01:33.000> total<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:34.439> her

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
four or five nights total and we had her

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
four or five nights total and we had her
done

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
done

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
done
now<00:01:35.310> listen<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.850> huh<00:01:36.030> yeah<00:01:36.479> put<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
now listen to it huh yeah put the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:56.249 
now listen to it huh yeah put the
sweater<00:01:37.110> off

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.819 

seems<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.100> oddly<00:01:57.729> enough<00:01:57.820> work<00:01:58.270> better<00:01:58.829> with

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
seems to oddly enough work better with

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.420 
seems to oddly enough work better with
more<00:02:00.070> apples<00:02:01.409> throw<00:02:02.409> on<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> product<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
more apples throw on it the product I

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.160 
more apples throw on it the product I
think<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.820> makes<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.450> bounce<00:02:04.689> around<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.140> lot

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
think that makes it bounce around a lot

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.380 
think that makes it bounce around a lot
better

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.710 

what<00:02:11.810> we're<00:02:11.990> missing<00:02:12.380> it<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.480> lid

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
what we're missing it if it's the lid

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.559 
what we're missing it if it's the lid
and<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.230> push<00:02:15.890> bar<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.670> every<00:02:16.940> other<00:02:17.060> video<00:02:17.300> I've

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
and a push bar is every other video I've

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.020 
and a push bar is every other video I've
seen<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> guys<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.319> push<00:02:18.500> bar<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:19.910> think

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
seen the guys have a push bar so I think

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.490 
seen the guys have a push bar so I think
we<00:02:20.180> need<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.390> make<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> push<00:02:20.810> bar<00:02:20.990> with<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> plate

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
we need to make a push bar with a plate

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.059 
we need to make a push bar with a plate
for<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:22.900> other<00:02:23.900> than<00:02:24.110> nuts<00:02:24.319> really<00:02:24.740> small

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
for it other than nuts really small

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.710 
for it other than nuts really small
details<00:02:25.459> there's<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> couple<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.180> side<00:02:26.360> covers

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
details there's a couple of side covers

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.090 
details there's a couple of side covers
need<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> come<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.500> see<00:02:27.709> where<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
need to come in if you see where the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.610 
need to come in if you see where the
apples<00:02:28.490> popping<00:02:28.910> out<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.350> side<00:02:30.590> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
apples popping out here on this side of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.590 
apples popping out here on this side of
the<00:02:30.830> chain<00:02:31.040> drive<00:02:31.310> I'll<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.420> make<00:02:32.540> some

the chain drive I'll have to make some

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.420 
the chain drive I'll have to make some
plates<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.380> go<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.650> behind<00:02:33.800> there<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.280> keep

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.360 

two<00:03:25.290> light<00:03:25.500> sources

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.770 

and<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.209> back<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.739> side<00:03:35.010> we

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
and then back in here on this side we

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.500 
and then back in here on this side we
needed<00:03:36.780> an<00:03:36.900> adjuster<00:03:38.150> adjustment<00:03:39.150> arm<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
needed an adjuster adjustment arm so I

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.660 
needed an adjuster adjustment arm so I
had<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.780> make<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.170> out<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> plywood<00:03:40.830> the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
had to make this out of plywood the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.360 
had to make this out of plywood the
actual<00:03:42.000> arm<00:03:42.180> itself<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.840> then<00:03:42.959> we<00:03:43.800> had<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.220> a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
actual arm itself and then we had just a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.000 
actual arm itself and then we had just a
regular<00:03:44.849> bearing<00:03:45.360> press<00:03:45.900> fit<00:03:46.110> bearing<00:03:46.440> that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
regular bearing press fit bearing that

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.710 
regular bearing press fit bearing that
we<00:03:47.160> kind<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.760> jockey<00:03:48.030> din<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> piece<00:03:48.690> of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
we kind of jockey din to a piece of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.440 
we kind of jockey din to a piece of
tubing<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.910> torsion<00:03:51.360> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
tubing and and because of the torsion of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.960 
tubing and and because of the torsion of
the<00:03:51.569> chain<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.110> was<00:03:52.290> kind<00:03:53.099> of<00:03:53.190> bending<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.670> arm

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
the chain it was kind of bending the arm

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.780 
the chain it was kind of bending the arm
when<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:54.810> under<00:03:55.019> load<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:56.160> what<00:03:56.549> we<00:03:56.640> did

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
when it was under load so what we did

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.270 
when it was under load so what we did
was<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.150> put<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.629> push<00:03:58.049> rod<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.680> at<00:03:59.099> a

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
was we put a push rod in at a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
was we put a push rod in at a
three-quarter<00:03:59.879> threaded<00:04:00.840> rod<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.170> push<00:04:01.410> on

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
three-quarter threaded rod to push on

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.740 
three-quarter threaded rod to push on
the<00:04:01.680> backside<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.280> axle<00:04:02.790> at<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.569> same

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
the backside of the axle at the same

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.680 
the backside of the axle at the same
time<00:04:03.959> we're<00:04:04.200> pulling<00:04:04.730> with<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.269> smaller

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
time we're pulling with the smaller

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.390 
time we're pulling with the smaller
threaded<00:04:07.170> rod<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.680> evens<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.250> that

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
threaded rod so it evens it all that

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.370 
threaded rod so it evens it all that
keeps<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.790> straight<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.269> buckets<00:04:10.049> made<00:04:10.230> out

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
keeps it straight and buckets made out

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.990 
keeps it straight and buckets made out
of<00:04:10.470> wood<00:04:10.620> can't<00:04:11.099> go<00:04:11.190> wrong<00:04:11.400> how'd<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.849> Bend

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
of wood can't go wrong how'd you Bend

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.630 
of wood can't go wrong how'd you Bend
that<00:04:12.120> rod<00:04:12.299> Mike<00:04:12.590> how<00:04:13.590> did<00:04:13.769> we<00:04:13.890> bend<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.190> right

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
that rod Mike how did we bend that right

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.340 
that rod Mike how did we bend that right
oh<00:04:14.670> by<00:04:15.269> hand<00:04:15.480> yeah<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.690> run<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> pipe<00:04:16.139> with<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
oh by hand yeah I run the pipe with a

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.719 
oh by hand yeah I run the pipe with a
hammer<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.680> don't<00:04:16.919> think<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.130> used<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> hammer<00:04:17.489> I
