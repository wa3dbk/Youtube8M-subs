00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the new Pokemon movie as it is using

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
to suck these other pokemon in two

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.320 
to suck these other pokemon in two
different<00:02:39.950> dimensions<00:02:40.580> within<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> movie

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
different dimensions within the movie

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.729 
different dimensions within the movie

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
and I think it's going to be the biggest

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.250 
and I think it's going to be the biggest
