00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 It is why there is no super hero 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.630
 Brazilian is because the super heroes who 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 there are only Americans, and they have not been 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.400
 made comics comic 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 In Brazil, Brazilian superheroes 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 it's a question sometimes a lot and so 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
 very complicated to answer that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 involve several factors 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.189
 could cite the simplest factor of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.210
 All is the fact that Brazil 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 unfortunately have not developed a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.079
 industry is a production system 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 comic book like the American 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 It's 66 and comics in Brazil have always been 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 something very complicated is to develop 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 then your own characters and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.260
 placed on the market 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.329
 transformed into comic books 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 which can be consumed and sold in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 bookstores has always been something very 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 difficult in Brazil a number of factors 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.850
 we can cite economic factors 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 a series of things that we 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 we would have to rocchi would be a very video 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.740
 Good, let's try on Sunday. 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420
 we can then use it as a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 possible excuse does not exist it is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 the Brazilian market because the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 Comic strip Brazil has always been very 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 difficult and logical exception for the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 Monica on Monte Souza and a few 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 comics that survive in 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 an independent market this reality 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.710
 of the Brazilian artist does not have conditions 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.470
 to develop your own creation can 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 be pointed out as one of the factors that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.210
 there is a national superhero 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 but I believe the greatest of all 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 factors 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.939
 maybe it's cultural is that superhero 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 is an essentially American theme 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.250
 was created in the United States 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.409
 first hero characters appeared in the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.630
 time of the Second World War where there 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.369
 the American spirit was very strong 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.380
 I've seen this war spirit grotto 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.689
 so this is very much related to the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.390
 American culture and the African landscape 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.250
 so we get used to characters 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.400
 within the American scene in cities 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.410
 new york to cities 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.810
 created but that look like cities 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.150
 as super metropolis 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 put a place of baptism that I am not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.450
 nothing more nothing less than landscape 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.150
 typically American 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.430
 then it would be strange then , 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 we suddenly see a superhero character 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.819
 national in rio de janeiro in sÃ£o paulo 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.060
 and strength for example we do not have this 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.620
 act of valuing our scenario 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.989
 national 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.810
 but despite all this it means a 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.580
 something for you despite all this 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.590
 Yes, there were national heroes. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.200
 made national super heroes 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.870
 one of them oldest years of the black ray 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.680
 gb unipar the ball with a great artist 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.019
 national 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.750
 we also have captain 7 there was 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.760
 attempts to create characters in the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.120
 your most powerful 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.010
 sometimes very reminiscent of the the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.530
 American characters but it is precisely 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.130
 that's why they did not have this life 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.750
 showcase despite the market has 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.910
 developed has not assimilated into the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.389
 national characters they did not have 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.410
 a long time of life because it does not 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.940
 they did not have what it's like to run with 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.280
 American characters much more 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.500
 elaborated and that were in up to the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.200
 of your environment, which is the environment 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.989
 where everything surgery 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.720
 it is clear that today the market for whom 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.329
 draw four days for us to work 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.150
 with American you hardly go 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.910
 create a super hero character and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.530
 put it on the south market is one thing 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.359
 that we have to be realistic but 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.359
 there is a very large market for 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.260
 national artists is that drawing for the 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.620
 U.S 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.900
 many Brazilians to become known 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.150
 out there and became reference what 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.910
 by itself is a fantastic thing to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.110
 Who likes superhero more? 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.420
 there is a subject here that we are going 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.720
 approach in the next video but 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.160
 already mentioned we had 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.769
 several Brazilian examples that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.670
 have made references in other styles and 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.830
 comic books 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.560
 the picture that the Brazilian people are 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.270
 Fantastic Brazilian cartoon 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.250
 Brazilian cartoonists are among the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.070
 world's best 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.140
 we also had a wealth in the picture 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.690
 of terror in the big names 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.570
 artists who made classics in 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.670
 Goal comics had times when 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.300
 there were several magazines and terror 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.980
 that were references to relief 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.850
 world but this unfortunately 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.220
 Unfortunately we have a very problem. 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.780
 serious about memory 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.360
 many Brazilian masters are 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.700
 forgotten and are not known 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.770
 new generation that is there the thing that we 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.680
 we seek in our schools to focus 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.810
 much but in this case our subject is 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.420
 exclusively on the superhero to 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.520
 clarify that certain doubt then 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.230
 those who had doubts because they did not 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.220
 There is Brazilian proof. I think 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:20.310
 through this simple explanation also 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.560
 I believe that to clarify a little the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.870
 reason right 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.190
 I hope you liked the video.

 Okay, thank you so much and let's go 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.870
 to continue whistling our artist is a 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.180
 Brazilian artist wants to be a super 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.760
 artist or simple artist but does not 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.750
 to be an artist who deserves our 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.030
 respect 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.030
 right then until the next
