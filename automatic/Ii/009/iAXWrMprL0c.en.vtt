 [music] 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.240
 hello there is a basketball store with 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.970
 Beeline and today you will see the review we 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.220
 sneakers nike air zoom clara reader 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.200
 forms well, or as a kind of flowed grade 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.060
 called turning 2k 4 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 For the first time, these sneakers came in 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.580
 2004 sale but in my hands 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.410
 second release reissue of 2012 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.330
 I would also like to tell you that these 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.760
 sneakers were available on nike 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.370
 ideas where we could experiment 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.380
 The purpose of the design pure sneakers is made of 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.810
 such a white synthetic material 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.900
 but unfortunately its exact name you 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.329
 I can not say but by the sound of thoughts you 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.070
 Now I hear his evil this material is not 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.200
 mention that from such an example do 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.660
 raincoats or any overalls 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.899
 that's just by itself lost denser and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.370
 thicker not know not such an association 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.200
 areas of the nose come out such a stripe 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.340
 now showed my borders well and 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.710
 this element is intended to 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.360
 protect our fingers from hitting the back 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 Sneaker parts of the heel area such 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.549
 plastic cup and you see it 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.240
 such a wavy shape and this 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.670
 grew up meant to our 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.180
 catching up felt discomfort in the image in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.040
 areas 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 tendons well and actually backdrop 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.330
 designed to fix our legs 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.060
 now show you the strap attached it 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.280
 so that's Velcro and so intended 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.560
 he in order to protect our many 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.600
 injuries and personally I think that he is not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.510
 copes very well with this task 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.880
 well, I just don't know when 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.659
 generally tuck the feet of these sneakers 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 here look upper search sneaker 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.550
 quite mobile 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.210
 Koby Bryant still has time to play these 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.530
 sneakers does not fasten the strap and so 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.900
 what I think specifically for this was 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.490
 invented such a white rubber band 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.610
 this element which will not allow 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.600
 Strap her in state buttoned 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.850
 hang around 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.660
 that the side of the sneaker is present 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.290
 there are such holes on both sides 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.330
 they are designed to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.070
 somehow, too, probably improve fixation 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.290
 our legs because we have straight 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.210
 opposite the bones what to see there such 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.410
 that's transparent 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.600
 transparent nets are present from both 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.210
 parties at the expense of which is improving 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.980
 ventilation also ventilation improves 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.810
 due to 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.700
 hole on the inside sneaker 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 and due to reed netting structure 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.960
 themselves offset what is internal 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.560
 with a toe and I showed it to you now 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.740
 boundaries 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.350
 now show the insole you see it so 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.020
 pertly up the heel area and all this 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.570
 for our convenience and on the wash itself 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.000
 Means technology crusts yet 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.850
 there are such elements from more 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.670
 bad material than the wall itself all this 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.860
 improves damping and only 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
 lilac color you 'll see made of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 material called philo which 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.350
 is very easy and also improves 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.030
 depreciation also depreciation is responsible 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.000
 air balloons you see your teeth and under 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.950
