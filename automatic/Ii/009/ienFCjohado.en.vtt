first<00:01:39.979> or<00:01:40.190> second<00:01:40.550> games<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.149> was<00:01:41.270> just

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
first or second games of it I was just

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
kind of playing around and it ended up

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.960 
kind of playing around and it ended up
being<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.349> pretty<00:01:45.649> good<00:01:45.770> game<00:01:46.009> play<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.310> uh<00:01:46.580> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
being a pretty good game play so uh I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.139 
being a pretty good game play so uh I
thought<00:01:47.569> you<00:01:47.780> know<00:01:47.899> why<00:01:48.349> not<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.770> let<00:01:49.069> it<00:01:49.280> let

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
thought you know why not just let it let

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.510 
thought you know why not just let it let
it<00:01:50.330> fly<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.739> brings<00:01:52.099> me<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.250> my<00:01:52.369> next

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
it fly and that brings me to my next

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.219 
it fly and that brings me to my next
point<00:01:53.380> what<00:01:54.380> happened<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.069> Chris<00:01:55.459> smooth<00:01:56.229> he's

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
point what happened to Chris smooth he's

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.089 
point what happened to Chris smooth he's
not<00:01:57.470> letting<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:58.039> gameplays<00:01:58.610> fly<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.979> want<00:02:00.979> to

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
not letting the gameplays fly I want to

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.910 
not letting the gameplays fly I want to
see<00:02:01.310> some<00:02:02.440> helo<00:02:03.440> pilots<00:02:04.039> there<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.700> no<00:02:04.880> ac-130

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
see some helo pilots there is no ac-130

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.949

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
like he did back in the day like mw2 and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.430 
like he did back in the day like mw2 and
this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.390> game<00:02:54.630> right<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.110> mean<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
this is the game right here I mean this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.789 
this is the game right here I mean this
is<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> game<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.630> plays<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.680> mw2<00:02:58.680> and

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
is the game that that plays like mw2 and

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.699 
is the game that that plays like mw2 and
mw3<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.819> know<00:03:00.599> he<00:03:00.810> wasn't<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> very<00:03:01.230> big<00:03:01.349> fan<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
mw3 I know he wasn't a very big fan of

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
mw3 I know he wasn't a very big fan of
having<00:03:01.890> w3<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.849> I<00:03:03.920> still<00:03:04.920> think<00:03:05.630> something<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
having w3 but I still think something is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.949 
having w3 but I still think something is
lacking<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.230> my<00:03:07.319> life<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:09.090> right<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:09.569> that's

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
lacking in my life all right well that's

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:10.970 
lacking in my life all right well that's
enough<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.440> that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
enough of that

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.949 
enough of that
I'm<00:03:11.549> sure<00:03:11.819> he'll<00:03:12.030> never<00:03:12.180> probably<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.780> this

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
I'm sure he'll never probably see this

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.500 
I'm sure he'll never probably see this
but<00:03:13.829> I'm<00:03:14.069> gonna<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.430> back<00:03:14.459> talking<00:03:15.030> about<00:03:15.269> sort

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
but I'm gonna go back talking about sort

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.259 
but I'm gonna go back talking about sort
of<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.660> gameplay<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:17.040> far<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.700> far<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:18.060> what

of the gameplay as far as as far as what
I'm<00:03:18.360> running<00:03:18.569> right<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:18.989> I'm<00:03:19.170> running<00:03:19.319> a

with any of those secondaries it's
pointless

oh I think I just said Streep was

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.020 
oh I think I just said Streep was
thinking<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.910> something<00:03:57.569> else

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
especially in game times like this one

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320 
especially in game times like this one
of<00:04:43.440> what<00:04:43.590> else<00:04:43.770> am<00:04:43.890> i<00:04:43.979> running

trainee rocket Trinity Rockets are

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.750 
trainee rocket Trinity Rockets are
pretty<00:05:05.860> much<00:05:05.949> pointless<00:05:06.990> there's<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:09.070> don't

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
pretty much pointless there's I don't

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.460 
pretty much pointless there's I don't
know<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.060> would<00:05:10.240> just<00:05:10.270> hide<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.320> was

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
know I would just hide that was

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.750 
know I would just hide that was
something<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.860> kind<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.160> stopped<00:05:12.400> doing

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
something I kind of stopped doing

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.760 
something I kind of stopped doing
there's<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.180> Trinity<00:05:13.389> rocket<00:05:13.840> because<00:05:14.110> it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
there's a Trinity rocket because it

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.560 
there's a Trinity rocket because it
really<00:05:15.070> it's<00:05:15.520> not<00:05:15.699> like<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.850> predator<00:05:16.210> missile

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
really it's not like a predator missile

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.020 
really it's not like a predator missile
where<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.780> can<00:05:16.900> actually<00:05:17.139> control<00:05:17.470> it

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
where you can actually control it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.779 
where you can actually control it
well<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.660> just<00:05:19.720> fires<00:05:20.169> down<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:20.860> fast<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.669> you

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
well it just fires down so fast that you

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.790 
well it just fires down so fast that you
really<00:05:22.150> don't<00:05:22.539> have<00:05:23.100> enough<00:05:24.100> time<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.400> get

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
really don't have enough time to get

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.379 
really don't have enough time to get
multiple<00:05:26.800> angles<00:05:27.460> on<00:05:27.610> people<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.090> really<00:05:28.300> you

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
multiple angles on people so really you

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.969 
multiple angles on people so really you
only<00:05:28.419> in<00:05:28.870> my<00:05:29.020> experience<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.620> only<00:05:29.740> get<00:05:29.889> the

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
only in my experience you only get the

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.550 
only in my experience you only get the
first<00:05:30.010> two<00:05:30.400> Rockets<00:05:30.910> down<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.449> then<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.380> last

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
first two Rockets down and then the last

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.770 
first two Rockets down and then the last
one<00:05:32.800> kind<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.160> just<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:34.030> mean<00:05:34.330> you<00:05:34.389> can't<00:05:34.690> really

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
one kind of just I mean you can't really

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.159 
one kind of just I mean you can't really
go<00:05:35.080> anywhere<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:36.220> find<00:05:36.490> somebody<00:05:36.729> so<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:37.360> would
