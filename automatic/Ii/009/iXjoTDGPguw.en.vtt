kind<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.630> plot<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.060> well-executed<00:04:19.600> and

I think the structure of the game has

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.210 
I think the structure of the game has
taken<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> lot<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.870> influence<00:04:23.470> from<00:04:23.920> Mass
