00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.230
 sascha for magix here we are in the year 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.200
 as video street during the ces 2010 in 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.240
 las vegas at the trump hotel second floor 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.530
 Maybe that's what I think 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.359
 some never even remember one 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.230
 remote app smart the plane now since 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.060
 about four weeks 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.489
 UPS unpacked and tested is with us 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.019
 on the youtube channel on it only existed 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.029
 a problem there was never a right 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.460
 ran for it or in the case of it must 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 I already use that from acer and that 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.369
 second problem was with the windows 8 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.380
 if you are a bit productive 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.480
 want to be and keyboard now 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.700
 is the solution and indeed it has now 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.410
 put out a bit of accessories here 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.050
 and this is this 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.410
 bluetooth keyboard this in two colors 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 gives champagne once black which is 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700
 something like that from st 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.280
 So I am sure that the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.360
 under 100, so program less than 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.450
 chalkboard chocolate and you could see 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.220
 here by micro usb charge accordingly 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.829
 of course, is no docking station but 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 in the scope of delivery is then also 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.729
 here 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.859
 this cover the wetab smart is coming now 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.100
 By the way out in the next center 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:15.829
 january and the combination of this 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.889
 bluetooth keyboard and this coburg 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.770
 Cover will be out in about two weeks 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:24.020
 be available price 109 euro as 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.490
 bluetooth keyboard and the cover like 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.450
 Does this work with the cover? 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.009
 I have to train a little bit 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.799
 I say it's a bit like that 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.359
 Apple smart could see that, then 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.359
 magnetic and then backwards 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.420
 how big will the whole thing speak 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.110
 easily folded and could 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.210
 put down 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.210
 at the devices here one can do that completely 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.140
 well, that's a bit strange 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.000
 for me that's what some somehow 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.030
 you just do not have to turn around 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 this velvet side somehow then messed up 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 anyway there is in the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.409
 different colors 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.000
 this could be the one to see here 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.519
 other color we are currently accompanying 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.530
 has been 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.680
