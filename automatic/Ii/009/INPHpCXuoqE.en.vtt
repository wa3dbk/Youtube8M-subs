 He is and it's very clear here 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.379
 very direct information for my 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.300
 Office here already my little da da 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 organ performance leaves detained

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 power interlegis neighbor down 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 integrated in the button is very easy 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.079
 reading the information in front of the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.699
 Cabinet here she is has this detail 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.199
 This relief looks great gives a 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 cool for him 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 this upper part lets you see that the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 partition is in case you are going to add a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 memory card reader something 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.170
 type and down the road from the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.650
 choice of 120mm for you are 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.810
 this is the side of the cabinet is in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.720
 Grille on this grid finish 2 tablespoons 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.799
 of 120 the drilling debate right here 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 then you can by 24,120 screw 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.530
 hand do not need boring cabinet 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 whole too good, this is a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130
 cool thing that I found here in this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.070
 is that it does not follow that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.200
 cheap pine cabinet standard that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.000
 come in here is a sack of you hit 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 all tires and close 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.220
 it follows cabinet standard take that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 You just pull here he was already in the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.880
 front 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.950
 It's practically impossible to show this 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.930
 on the camera but here is a docking 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.680
 his front is blackberry bent to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 inside 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.070
 nice from earth 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
 so we talked to fit 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.569
 choose 120 on the side 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.080
 2 tablespoons of 120 in the front one 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.410
 goal of 120 under two short of 120 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.300
 on top and it will confuse 120 behind and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.790
 will accompany a jump but it will fit more 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.580
 one two three four five more skeptical 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.680
 squid is is run like hell 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.690
 Talk about the interior it comes with filter 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.420
 both for the source and the bottom 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.420
 so much demand that if you add already 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.739
 It comes with filter eff other plastic not 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 can wash in the water has space to spin 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.170
 behind the motherboard is a space that I 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.700
 I can say so medium but do all 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.630
 the wires quietly behind the plate 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.330
 mom 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.220
