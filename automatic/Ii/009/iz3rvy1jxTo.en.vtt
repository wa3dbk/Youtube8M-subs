00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
door like we did previously so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.789 
door like we did previously so
essentially<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:22.320> doing<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
essentially what you're doing is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
essentially what you're doing is
tricking<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.220> game<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.729> thinking<00:01:24.119> you're

tricking your game into thinking you're

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030

in<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> phone<00:01:24.720> call<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> don't<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
in a phone call so then you don't go to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
in a phone call so then you don't go to
low<00:01:26.280> census<00:01:26.700> customs<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.659> call

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
low census customs so there we go call

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929
