this video is meant to show you a couple
of<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.520> effect<00:00:05.879> tools<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.720> lighter<00:00:06.899> on

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
of the effect tools in the lighter on

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.810 
of the effect tools in the lighter on
the<00:00:07.200> sequence<00:00:07.529> editor<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.400> use<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the sequence editor that you can use to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.470 
the sequence editor that you can use to
make<00:00:08.940> your<00:00:09.000> lights<00:00:09.570> behave<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.590> certain<00:00:10.769> ways

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
make your lights behave in certain ways

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.280 
make your lights behave in certain ways
specifically<00:00:12.480> we're<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:12.900> at<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
specifically we're going to look at the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.919 
specifically we're going to look at the
twinkle<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.070> shimmer<00:00:14.610> tools<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.570> video

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
twinkle and shimmer tools in this video

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.120 
twinkle and shimmer tools in this video
so<00:00:16.859> here's<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:18.210> twinkle<00:00:18.630> tool<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.140> here's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so here's the twinkle tool and here's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
so here's the twinkle tool and here's
the<00:00:20.400> shimmer<00:00:20.670> tool<00:00:20.970> let's<00:00:21.840> select<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the shimmer tool let's select the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.279 
the shimmer tool let's select the
twinkle<00:00:22.769> tool<00:00:23.010> first<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.990> turn<00:00:24.990> some<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
twinkle tool first and turn some of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.339 
twinkle tool first and turn some of
these<00:00:25.439> channels<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.490> that's<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:27.349> twinkle

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
these channels on so that's what twinkle

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.470 
these channels on so that's what twinkle
looks<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.550> sequence<00:00:29.939> editor<00:00:30.060> grid

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
looks like in the sequence editor grid

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
looks like in the sequence editor grid
it's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> bunch<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.219> a<00:00:32.219> bunch<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.759> X's<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.040> now

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's a bunch of a bunch of X's and now

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.979 
it's a bunch of a bunch of X's and now
let's<00:00:35.280> turn<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.059> fact<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> these

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
let's turn on in fact all of these

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.160 
let's turn on in fact all of these
channels<00:00:37.590> make<00:00:38.550> them<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:39.000> twinkle<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.989> five

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
channels make them all twinkle for five

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.270 
channels make them all twinkle for five
seconds<00:00:41.090> what<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> twinkle<00:00:42.540> tool<00:00:42.750> will<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
seconds what the twinkle tool will do in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
seconds what the twinkle tool will do in
your<00:00:44.340> sequence<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.629> will<00:00:45.780> cause<00:00:45.989> your

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
your sequence is it will cause your

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.920 
your sequence is it will cause your
lights<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> flicker<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.579> quickly<00:00:47.969> but

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
lights to flicker on and off quickly but

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229 
lights to flicker on and off quickly but
randomly<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.399> sync<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.850> each<00:00:50.969> other

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
randomly and not in sync with each other

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
randomly and not in sync with each other
so<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> other<00:00:51.809> words<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:52.949> may<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.190> on

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so in other words one of them may be on

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
so in other words one of them may be on
while<00:00:53.910> another<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.480> may<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:55.160> even<00:00:56.160> though

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
while another one may be off even though

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.569 
while another one may be off even though
they're<00:00:56.460> both<00:00:56.610> twinkling<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.199> time

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
they're both twinkling at the same time

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
they're both twinkling at the same time
so<00:00:59.579> let's<00:01:00.359> play<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> sequence<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.680> what

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so let's play the sequence and see what

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
so let's play the sequence and see what
happens<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.460> twinkle<00:01:03.270> by<00:01:03.750> watching<00:01:04.019> these

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
happens as we twinkle by watching these

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
happens as we twinkle by watching these
channel<00:01:04.890> buttons<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.150> channel

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
channel buttons which the channel

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
channel buttons which the channel
buttons<00:01:06.720> will<00:01:06.900> give<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.470> idea<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> how

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
buttons will give you some idea of how

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.850 
buttons will give you some idea of how
your<00:01:08.729> lights<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.180> behave<00:01:09.570> during<00:01:09.930> play<00:01:10.350> when

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
your lights will behave during play when

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
your lights will behave during play when
you<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.369> hook<00:01:11.549> lights<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.420> your

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you actually hook lights up to your

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
you actually hook lights up to your
controllers<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.220> control<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
controllers and control them with this

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960 
controllers and control them with this
sequence<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:16.920> play<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> watch<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sequence so let's play and watch the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.679 
sequence so let's play and watch the
sequence<00:01:18.270> buttons<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> they're<00:01:20.549> all

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
sequence buttons so they're all

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.330 
sequence buttons so they're all
twinkling<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.619> randomly<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
twinkling on and off but randomly and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
twinkling on and off but randomly and
not<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.000> sync<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.479> each<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.900> let's<00:01:25.439> try

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
not in sync with each other let's try

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.929 
not in sync with each other let's try
that<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.040> time<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.790> watch<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that one more time just to watch it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.460 
that one more time just to watch it
again

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.460 

and<00:01:31.850> that's<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> twinkle<00:01:33.450> tool<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and that's the twinkle tool now the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.280 
and that's the twinkle tool now the
shimmer<00:01:34.830> tool<00:01:35.160> which<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.290> kind

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
shimmer tool which is this one is kind

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.330 
shimmer tool which is this one is kind
of<00:01:37.410> similar<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:39.770> your<00:01:40.770> chant<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> will

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of similar in that your chant it will

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.240 
of similar in that your chant it will
cause<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.700> channels<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.960> flicker<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
cause your channels to all flicker on

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.420 
cause your channels to all flicker on
and<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.600> rapidly<00:01:45.620> but<00:01:46.620> it's<00:01:47.010> different

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and off rapidly but it's different

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
and off rapidly but it's different
because<00:01:47.760> they'll<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> constant

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
because they'll all do so at a constant

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.400 
because they'll all do so at a constant
rate<00:01:49.980> and<00:01:50.280> they'll<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.660> sync<00:01:52.080> any

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
rate and they'll all do so in sync any

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.850 
rate and they'll all do so in sync any
of<00:01:53.010> them<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.730> set<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:55.740> be

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of them that you have set up to to be

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490 
of them that you have set up to to be
shimmering<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.640> any<00:01:56.880> point<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.360> time<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
shimmering at any point in time all of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.460 
shimmering at any point in time all of
them<00:01:58.830> will<00:01:59.010> either<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.550> or<00:02:00.090> off<00:02:00.510> at<00:02:01.110> any

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
them will either be on or off at any

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.170 
them will either be on or off at any
given<00:02:01.800> moment<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:04.280> if<00:02:05.280> one<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.760> them<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> on

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
given moment so if one of them is on

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240 
given moment so if one of them is on
they'll<00:02:06.750> all<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> ones<00:02:08.130> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
they'll all be on all of the ones that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.290 
they'll all be on all of the ones that
are<00:02:08.459> set<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.760> shimmer

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
are set up to shimmer

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720 
are set up to shimmer
if<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:10.350> that's<00:02:10.649> set<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.010> shimmer<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.550> off

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
if one that's set up to shimmer is off

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.930 
if one that's set up to shimmer is off
all<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.630> will<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.930> off<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> again<00:02:14.700> let's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
all of them will be off so again let's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.810 
all of them will be off so again let's
play<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.600> sequence<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.200> watch<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.580> channel

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
play the sequence and watch the channel

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.000 
play the sequence and watch the channel
buttons<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.720> they're<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.020> going<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.920> off

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
buttons so they're all going on and off

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.360 
buttons so they're all going on and off
at<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> constant<00:02:23.730> rate<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.950> they're<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.130> doing

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
at a constant rate and they're all doing

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
at a constant rate and they're all doing
so<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> sync<00:02:27.209> let's<00:02:27.720> watch<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.290> more

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
so in sync let's watch that one more

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
so in sync let's watch that one more
time<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> give<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.459> contrast<00:02:36.060> let's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
time and just to give a contrast let's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800 
time and just to give a contrast let's
make<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.320> sequence<00:02:37.769> twinkle<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> first

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
make the sequence twinkle for the first

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.960 
make the sequence twinkle for the first
half<00:02:40.410> let's<00:02:40.890> say<00:02:41.040> two<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.370> half<00:02:41.519> seconds

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
half let's say two and a half seconds

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.759 
half let's say two and a half seconds
here<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.630> last<00:02:42.810> two<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.200> half<00:02:43.320> seconds

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
here and the last two and a half seconds

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.850 
here and the last two and a half seconds
we'll<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.430> shimmer<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:46.140> watch<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
we'll see it shimmer and watch the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250 
we'll see it shimmer and watch the
channel<00:02:47.040> buttons<00:02:47.459> for<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:49.019> how<00:02:49.110> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
channel buttons for the for how it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.979 
channel buttons for the for how it
behaves<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.769> each<00:02:49.920> section<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.330> go<00:02:56.989> so

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
behaves in each section so here we go so

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
behaves in each section so here we go so
that's<00:02:58.230> twinkle<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.980> shimmer<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.519> there's<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
that's twinkle and shimmer now there's a

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.729 
that's twinkle and shimmer now there's a
little<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.750> twinkle<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.230> shimmer<00:03:01.410> which

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
little more to twinkle and shimmer which

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.840 
little more to twinkle and shimmer which
is<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.810> make<00:03:04.130> twinkling<00:03:05.130> fade<00:03:05.459> ups

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
is that you can make twinkling fade ups

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.720 
is that you can make twinkling fade ups
and<00:03:06.330> fade<00:03:06.540> downs<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.470> shimmering<00:03:08.130> fade<00:03:08.459> ups

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
and fade downs and shimmering fade ups

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
and fade downs and shimmering fade ups
and<00:03:09.090> fade<00:03:09.450> downs<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.200> that'll<00:03:10.830> be<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> topic

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and fade downs and that'll be a topic

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.610 
and fade downs and that'll be a topic
for<00:03:11.370> another<00:03:11.610> video<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.840> what's<00:03:13.380> called

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
for another video in what's called

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
for another video in what's called
custom<00:03:14.340> tools<00:03:14.959> but<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.950> video<00:03:17.280> which<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
custom tools but this video which is the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.620 
custom tools but this video which is the
basic<00:03:19.080> use<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.320> shimmer<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> twinkle<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.760> think

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
basic use of shimmer and twinkle I think

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.900 
basic use of shimmer and twinkle I think
we've<00:03:22.110> covered<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.530> about<00:03:22.799> all<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
we've covered just about all of it so I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.720 
we've covered just about all of it so I
hope<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.390> helps
