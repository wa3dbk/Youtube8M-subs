00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.200
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.390
 30 degrees today a little special 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.340
 edition or next four follow one 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.130
 little special edition we all know 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.320
 yes, the year is coming to an end and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.080
 Now I want you my personal 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.780
 Present favorites and shoot today 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.210
 it's all about the genre action adventure 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.920
 I have five this year too 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.170
 those favorites had me especially 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.510
 have moved and here I start 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.989
 Just with my first favorite 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.970
 and that is that darksiders 2 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.800
 I really think that's a very 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.440
 Good game was incredible 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.019
 many puzzle elements and it just has 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030
 this so open game world reflects this 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.949
 which one opens up more and more 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 collects different items times 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.030
 and it really meshes with each other 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.490
 There are still gears to mine 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.920
 I think very well worked out 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.380
 That's why this is the fight in the game 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.420
 definitely one of my five favorites 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.369
 on we go now with the folder, the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 mask of anger a game that is 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.750
 Alone for his own 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.790
 funky style love this year 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.310
 this steampunk style along with 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.260
 mixed this year renaissance style 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.060
 that is really amazing 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.490
 made and it gives me the opportunity 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.440
 in a game I do that very much 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.940
 like it and it is the sneak 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.100
 of course I can also action-packed 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.890
 but I can play here too 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.960
 my stealthy skills, so to speak, high 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.670
 farmers and then me past opponents 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.620
 I have to sneak around the game 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.810
 Do not bring a single person around the corner 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.130
 which I find very cool of course 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 and then there are already 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.570
 next title 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 Similarly, this is also true for far cry 3 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.530
 you have these incredibly huge 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.830
 then the island 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.690
 yes the customer may and can louder 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.760
 pursue different activities 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.320
 be it for example, you can play poker 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.880
 but also and of course the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.619
 must pursue main story then just 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 That's what his own friends are all about 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.760
 always had to liberate outpost 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.380
 Pry out to reduce the enemies 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.880
 And it can be synonymous on the very whole 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.800
 different ways and ways do 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.330
 because you are already such a skill tree resin 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.830
 and skill where to improve 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 can in different directions 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.610
 I find beautiful wonderful about 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 brought and said simply delivers 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.100
 Game content for countless hours 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.739
 I have countless hours of fun too 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.890
 the master chiefs halo 4 is this 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.959
 year came from a new developer 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.400
 graphically clearly the best halo that 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.019
 you've also seen what I have so far 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.640
 really beautiful or very 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.989
 think it is very cool that the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.819
 master chief really like this one 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.530
 he has worked out a little bit more 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.300
 a little more to tell and the story 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.519
 between him and cortina I find that 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 just a nice interaction of these 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.480
 both very memorable characters 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.750
 and then he is just that 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.880
 multiplayer mode of me certainly 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.280
 has been busy for weeks because of it 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.290
 just unbelievably good and yes it is 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 is just the typical helau quality and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.380
 In conclusion, as I said, I am very 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.560
 Schleich also suspects this year 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.100
 on the way there is still hitman absolution 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.100
 in the game 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.480
 The bald man is back and he has 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.260
 Once again proved that it always 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.150
 still on it 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 I especially like this one 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.370
 more open level where you just the qual 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.079
 choice has what creeping possibility 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.130
 I use now for my goal 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.049
 off 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.850
 and that works really right 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.799
 Well, you can be very creative and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.690
 That's why I love these open ones 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.299
 Playground level and that makes hitman 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.989
 absolution of my view still 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.790
 preferably 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.440
 yes, they were my five favorites 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.420
 from the category action adventure 2012 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.859
 maybe there were a few of you 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.859
 drive and how favorites with it
