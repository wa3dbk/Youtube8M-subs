00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.080
 There are already 7 black hawk s 70 helicopters and 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.150
 that acquired the army aviation to 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.850
 national level for the development of 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.189
 military operations these aircraft 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.439
 extracted directly from states 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.589
 united have provisioned with a 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.630
 double system of gps and digital maps 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:28.189
 to perform a more accurate navigation 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.679
 They are equipped with a crane 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.380
 rescue and a management system that 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.350
 monitors the transmission and 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.780
 ship rotors plus these are 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.010
 much more powerful and stable at the time 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.010
 to carry out a maneuver 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.839
 instead of flying on a flight 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.579
 instruments under clouds under an evil 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.879
 time in what you can do is drop 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 your controls adjust their parameters and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.089
 be very careful letters letters 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.460
 transmission levels engines and that 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.710
 makes the alert practically increase 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 situational and improve good security 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.550
 is the son I want asks too much 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.110
 systems too many components then 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.910
 like 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.290
 just like possibly a doctor is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.180
 directly try to know were 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.100
 birds so that in case it occurs 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 a failure an emergency in the can 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.210
 solve in a fast way 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.710
 that's black hawk that 70 and they adapt to 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.350
 the needs of who pilots and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 of the mission entrusted is why 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.790
 they are a lethal weapon in the fight against 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.790
 illegal armed groups in the country 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.820
 Army aviation is not formed 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.740
 by pilots the army aviation 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.800
 It is formed by aviator soldiers 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.440
 ground men 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.390
 for some reason or another the force 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.880
 required so we can overcome these 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.550
 aircraft is the difference between me I think 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.920
 that the pilot a commercial pilot or a 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.900
 pilot possibly of another force 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 an example aviation pilot 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.340
 Colombia is the only country in America 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.490
 latina with the biggest strawberry 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.050
 helicopters in the aircraft region 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.530
 fundamentals for tactical mobility 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.430
 of the troops what has contributed 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.230
 significantly to the construction of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.230
 peace and national defense
