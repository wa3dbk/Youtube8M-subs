00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
whole process over this will ensure that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.330 
whole process over this will ensure that

the end product will burn completely and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.140 
the end product will burn completely and
cleanly<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.079> omit<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:20.500> if<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.769> like<00:03:21.150> but

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
cleanly you can omit it if you like but

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.849 
cleanly you can omit it if you like but
I<00:03:22.209> find<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.660> some<00:03:22.900> sheets<00:03:23.230> may<00:03:23.470> not<00:03:23.650> burn
