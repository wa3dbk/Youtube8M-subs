00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
relationship between what had been a

and<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.360> she<00:01:21.479> something<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.320> become

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and now is she something that had become

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.320 
and now is she something that had become
part<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> daily<00:01:23.220> life<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> matter<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
part of daily life and as a matter of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.770 
part of daily life and as a matter of
fact<00:01:24.509> even<00:01:24.689> something<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:26.460> merits<00:01:27.060> burial

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
fact even something that merits burial

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
fact even something that merits burial
with<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> dead<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.700> big<00:01:29.909> shift

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
with the dead and that's a big shift

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.770 
with the dead and that's a big shift
indeed<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> dogs<00:01:32.280> were<00:01:32.640> even<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.210> attracted

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
indeed the dogs were even more attracted

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.980 
indeed the dogs were even more attracted
to<00:01:33.900> humans<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.920> built<00:01:35.189> Hut's<00:01:35.990> dog

bit smaller now the reason for that is
that<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:34.159> the<00:04:34.340> wild<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:35.449> kind<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.990> horn
