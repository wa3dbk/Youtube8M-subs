bit in the past but I want to talk about

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.019 
bit in the past but I want to talk about
data<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> mantra<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:20.640> thinking

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
data and the mantra that we're thinking

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.750 
data and the mantra that we're thinking
is<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> learn<00:00:23.100> from<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
is you learn from it

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.990 
is you learn from it
you<00:00:24.119> don't<00:00:24.390> live<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> couple<00:00:26.430> key<00:00:26.970> points

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
you don't live for it couple key points

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.290 
you don't live for it couple key points
will<00:00:27.420> hit<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.830> just<00:00:28.830> want<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> apologize<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.910> had

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.479 
reference them at all by the time I
realized<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.770> hadn't<00:00:34.980> referenced<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> two

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
reference a chart today data should

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.680 
reference a chart today data should
drive<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:45.270> decisions<00:00:46.160> okay<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.690> data

drive your decisions okay and data

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.459

so<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.190> back<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.670> data<00:00:53.910> especially

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
so don't look back to data especially

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.380 
so don't look back to data especially
don't<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.469> seeking

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390

ammunition<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> blame<00:00:57.870> right<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.940> data<00:00:59.940> should

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
ammunition to blame right so data should

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
ammunition to blame right so data should
not<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> something<00:01:00.660> where<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> look<00:01:01.109> back<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
not be something where you look back and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
not be something where you look back and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bit of a cycle here let's say in my

the first six and a half seven years of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
the first six and a half seven years of
our<00:01:24.750> marriage<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.229> never<00:01:26.040> stayed<00:01:27.030> within<00:01:27.360> our

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
our marriage we never stayed within our

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.730 
our marriage we never stayed within our
grocery<00:01:28.290> budget<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.799> hypothetical<00:01:29.640> right

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
grocery budget this hypothetical right

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
grocery budget this hypothetical right
the<00:01:31.740> data<00:01:31.979> showed<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.579> every<00:01:32.909> month<00:01:33.119> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the data showed me that every month we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.429 
the data showed me that every month we
overspent<00:01:33.750> hypothetically<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.229> would<00:01:37.229> go

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
overspent hypothetically then I would go

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.039 
overspent hypothetically then I would go
back<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.159> should<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.270> been<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:39.840> say

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
back I should have been I should say

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.420 
back I should have been I should say
there<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> breakdown<00:01:40.829> right<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
there was a breakdown right here I

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
there was a breakdown right here I
wasn't<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.030> accepting<00:01:42.600> reality<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.290> wasn't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
wasn't really accepting reality I wasn't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.219 
wasn't really accepting reality I wasn't
having<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.670> data<00:01:45.000> keep<00:01:45.420> me<00:01:45.600> honest<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
having the data keep me honest and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.920 
having the data keep me honest and
that's<00:01:46.470> where<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.740> becomes<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:47.159> useful<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that's where it becomes very useful so I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.190 
that's where it becomes very useful so I
would<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.340> budget<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.659> low<00:01:51.840> amount

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
would just budget the same to low amount

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
would just budget the same to low amount
and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.250> next<00:01:53.490> month<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.790> would

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and then the next month we would

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.010 
and then the next month we would
overspend<00:01:54.570> again<00:01:55.670> hypothetically<00:01:56.719> now<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
overspend again hypothetically now I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.760 
overspend again hypothetically now I
simply<00:01:58.500> budget<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.340> large<00:01:59.909> enough<00:02:00.180> amount

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
simply budget a large enough amount

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.490 
simply budget a large enough amount
hypothetically<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:03.450> enough<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.200> don't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
hypothetically and it's enough we don't

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.700 
hypothetically and it's enough we don't
overspend<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.399> our<00:02:05.790> groceries<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.710> accepted

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
overspend in our groceries I accepted

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.940 
overspend in our groceries I accepted
that<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:09.420> reality<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.860> have

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that the reality is what it is we have

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950 
that the reality is what it is we have
lots<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.310> mouths<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> feed

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
lots of mouths to feed

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.830 
lots of mouths to feed
that's<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.190> nothing's<00:02:14.730> gonna<00:02:14.820> change<00:02:15.060> there

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's it nothing's gonna change there
