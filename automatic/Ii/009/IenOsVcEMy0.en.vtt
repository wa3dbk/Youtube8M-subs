00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
got vinegar in it so it actually smells

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.100 
got vinegar in it so it actually smells
it's<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.800> an<00:03:34.920> acid<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.880> no<00:03:36.060> harmful<00:03:36.450> acid<00:03:36.900> so

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
it's like an acid but no harmful acid so

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.710 
it's like an acid but no harmful acid so
how<00:03:37.680> she<00:03:37.740> explained<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.460> to<00:03:38.520> us<00:03:38.670> was<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
how she explained it to us was if you

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.190 
how she explained it to us was if you
were<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:44.240> put<00:03:45.240> your<00:03:45.270> make<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.690> over<00:03:46.020> nothing

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
were to put your make up over nothing

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.010 
were to put your make up over nothing
then<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.880> has<00:03:48.000> nothing<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.330> stick<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.840> it's

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
then it has nothing to stick to it's

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.810 
then it has nothing to stick to it's
like<00:03:49.200> applying<00:03:49.620> eyeshadow<00:03:49.800> on<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> table<00:03:50.640> which

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
like applying eyeshadow on a table which

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.490 
like applying eyeshadow on a table which
I<00:03:50.940> thought<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:51.240> quite<00:03:51.390> good<00:03:51.660> way<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.230> putting

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
I thought was quite good way of putting

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500 
I thought was quite good way of putting
it<00:03:52.800> won't<00:03:53.040> stick<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.240> just

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
it won't stick to it so you this is just

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.700 
it won't stick to it so you this is just
kind<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.960> preparing<00:03:55.920> your<00:03:56.160> skin<00:03:56.550> for<00:03:57.180> makeup

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
kind of preparing your skin for makeup

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.820 
kind of preparing your skin for makeup
and<00:03:59.360> it<00:04:00.360> also<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.870> had<00:04:01.170> she<00:04:01.560> don't<00:04:01.800> have

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and it also I had she don't have

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.430 
and it also I had she don't have
congestion<00:04:02.340> who<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:03.870> takes<00:04:04.110> away<00:04:04.230> any

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
congestion who it just takes away any

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.160 
congestion who it just takes away any
day<00:04:04.620> skin<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.100> cleans<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.720> which<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.870> think's

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
day skin and cleans it which I think's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.420 
day skin and cleans it which I think's
very<00:04:07.290> good<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.100> like<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.940> hate<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.690> move<00:04:09.930> it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.060 

so<00:04:17.430> then<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:17.820> my<00:04:18.239> step<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.770> next

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
so then that is my step to the next

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.560 
so then that is my step to the next
thing<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.220> Caroline<00:04:20.640> Carla<00:04:21.000> gave<00:04:21.150> me<00:04:21.359> was

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
thing that Caroline Carla gave me was

a blemish coming through and it might

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.420 
a blemish coming through and it might
control<00:05:23.480> them<00:05:23.720> but<00:05:26.890> it's<00:05:27.890> not<00:05:28.070> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> stop

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430
