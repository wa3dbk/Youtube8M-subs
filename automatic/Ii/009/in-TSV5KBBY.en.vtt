00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.030 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.599> it's<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> good<00:00:00.840> time<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.319> return<00:00:01.680> to

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
I think it's a good time to return to

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.490 
I think it's a good time to return to
hand<00:00:02.610> rank<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.300> most<00:00:03.480> complicated<00:00:03.810> function

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hand rank the most complicated function

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.539 
hand rank the most complicated function
we'll<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.920> deal<00:00:05.100> with

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we'll have to deal with

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.059 
we'll have to deal with
we<00:00:06.029> know<00:00:06.180> hand<00:00:06.450> rank<00:00:06.660> takes<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.200> hand<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:07.680> input

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
we know hand rank takes a hand as input

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.629 
we know hand rank takes a hand as input
but<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.090> return<00:00:10.309> we<00:00:11.309> want<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
but what is it return we want it to

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.820 
but what is it return we want it to
return<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.940> value<00:00:12.240> indicate<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> ranking<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
return a value indicate the ranking of a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.709 
return a value indicate the ranking of a
hand<00:00:14.099> well<00:00:14.460> not<00:00:14.610> quite<00:00:14.759> sure<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.179> value

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
hand well not quite sure what that value

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.510 
hand well not quite sure what that value
should<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.800> has<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.100> something<00:00:17.310> that's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
should be it has to be something that's

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.929 
should be it has to be something that's
comparable<00:00:18.029> by<00:00:18.779> max<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.920> well<00:00:20.550> why<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
comparable by max so well why not a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
comparable by max so well why not a
number<00:00:21.439> there<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.500> nine<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.710> types<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
number there are nine different types of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
number there are nine different types of
hands<00:00:23.930> that<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.410> from<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.430> straight

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
hands that we know about from a straight

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
hands that we know about from a straight
flush<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.720> top<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.439> high<00:00:28.830> card<00:00:29.099> at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
flush at the at the top to high card at

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
flush at the at the top to high card at
the<00:00:29.369> bottom<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.840> number<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.349> from

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the bottom and we can number them from

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
the bottom and we can number them from
say<00:00:32.460> 0<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> 8<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> 8<00:00:34.020> being<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> highest

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
say 0 to 8 with the 8 being the highest

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.280 
say 0 to 8 with the 8 being the highest
for<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> straight<00:00:35.670> flush<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> here's<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
for the straight flush so here's a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
for the straight flush so here's a
sketch<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.829> solution<00:00:38.719> we<00:00:39.719> know<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.020> going

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sketch of a solution we know it's going

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
sketch of a solution we know it's going
to<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.260> important<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.129> ranks<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
to be important to look at ranks so

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.319 
to be important to look at ranks so
let's<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.700> extract<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
let's get them first we can extract the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.369 
let's get them first we can extract the
ranks<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:47.329> card<00:00:48.329> ranks<00:00:48.600> function<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ranks with our card ranks function and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.970 
ranks with our card ranks function and
then<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> say<00:00:51.440> first<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> check

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
then we can say first we want to check

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.760 
then we can say first we want to check
you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> straight<00:00:54.420> flush

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
you can see if we have a straight flush

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
you can see if we have a straight flush
so<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.059> ranks<00:00:57.420> form<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> straight<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.719> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so if the ranks form a straight and the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.899 
so if the ranks form a straight and the
cards<00:01:01.140> form<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> flush<00:01:02.960> then<00:01:04.070> we<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.250> return<00:01:05.369> 8

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
cards form a flush then we can return 8

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.190 
cards form a flush then we can return 8
the<00:01:06.420> highest<00:01:06.720> value<00:01:07.400> otherwise<00:01:08.750> what's<00:01:09.750> next

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the highest value otherwise what's next

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
the highest value otherwise what's next
well<00:01:10.680> four<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:14.580> only<00:01:14.700> thing

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
well four of a kind and the only thing

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.170 
well four of a kind and the only thing
we<00:01:15.000> need<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.619> kind<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.310> rank<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.060> gonna

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
we need in kind is the rank so I'm gonna

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.340 
we need in kind is the rank so I'm gonna
just<00:01:18.509> pass<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.090> ranks<00:01:21.450> form

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
just pass that in so if the ranks form

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.630 
just pass that in so if the ranks form
four<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:24.830> then<00:01:25.909> return<00:01:26.909> 7<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
four of a kind then return 7 and we

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
four of a kind then return 7 and we
could<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.920> go<00:01:32.100> through

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
could go on from there and I go through

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.109 
could go on from there and I go through
the<00:01:32.369> cases<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.939> by<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the cases one by one so we have a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.410 
the cases one by one so we have a
straight<00:01:36.329> flush<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> four<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.040> kind<00:01:38.420> we

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
straight flush we have four of a kind we

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
straight flush we have four of a kind we
would<00:01:39.600> next<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.110> full<00:01:40.619> house<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.250> then

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
would next go to full house and then

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.740 
would next go to full house and then
flush<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.380> now<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.979> question<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
flush and so on now the question is

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
flush and so on now the question is
would<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.960> work<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:47.880> continue<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> flesh

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
would this work if we continue to flesh

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.240 
would this work if we continue to flesh
this<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.290> define<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.100> nine

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this out and we define the nine

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
this out and we define the nine
different<00:01:50.729> cases<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.360> return<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
different cases to return that the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
different cases to return that the
numbers<00:01:52.500> from<00:01:52.740> zero<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.159> eight<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
numbers from zero to eight would that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
numbers from zero to eight would that
give<00:01:54.630> us<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> definition<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.649> hand<00:01:56.460> rank

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
give us the definition of hand rank

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
give us the definition of hand rank
that's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.210> working<00:01:57.390> program<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.530> want<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that's a working program I want you to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.080 
that's a working program I want you to
tell<00:01:59.640> me<00:01:59.899> yes<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:02.040> would<00:02:02.250> work<00:02:02.430> fine<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.939> all

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
tell me yes it would work fine in all

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.280 
tell me yes it would work fine in all
cases<00:02:03.530> no<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:06.240> would<00:02:06.420> signal<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:07.079> error

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
cases no it would signal an error

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.360 
cases no it would signal an error
condition<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> crash<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> program<00:02:09.410> no<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
condition and crash the program no it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
condition and crash the program no it
would<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.640> some

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
would get some
