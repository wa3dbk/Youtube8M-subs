00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.140
 percent 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.170
 because it has long been sold 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.510
 fell into the hands of one recently decided 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.769

 budget segment 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.630
 here is starting from percentage work time 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 ending any measures in general with others 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.560
 parameters 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.820
 but in general act as you can see in 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.490
 standby time 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.370
 all the advantages of this 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.440
 Land devices are gaining crane 6 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.090
