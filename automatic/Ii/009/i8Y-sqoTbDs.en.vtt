00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.930

 Now we have this car full of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.400
 stickers turned butt with their wheels 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.230

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.280

 pretty white because it has a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.090
 very important meaning for gta by 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.540

 what is 4x4 of this car is 5 x 5 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.290

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.049

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.510
 well then this car has been good 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.639

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:02.359

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.409
 well but we can put it to our 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.199
 garage and consume it our style 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.560

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.560
 car 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.930
 now we have an avant a common naval and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.879
 current is valid from outside 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.360
 is creates of things and so it is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.980
 is now but well when the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.530
 tournÃ©e we will do the truth is that there 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.660
 enough varieties to tune the one 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 you can put windows you can put 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.349

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.980
 pretty cool they were green that is a 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:07.060
 of the bands that is quite Uruguayan 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.069
 that we could find it is worth 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.349
 that is being the suburb of the 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.989
 saints and here as you can see there is a 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.720
 series of galleries that one should therefore 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.449
 how can you study this car because 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.330
 for me personally 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.669
 I do not have it in my garage, it's pretty 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.110
 cool ok then well how can you 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.930
 see is cool this they were and well that's 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.070
 what the most interesting were and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.830
 well 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.510
 in the location of they are now 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.870
 same on screen so that the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.870
 checks 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.830
 and well now we have this car 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.410
 this car that for me I call the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.810
 borrowed car is a car that we are going to 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.120
 find out the saints taste 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.030
 It's worth a car because it's donated 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.060
 but the bad thing is that I do not 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.760
 we can put what is being the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.100
 garage because it 's tuned by 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.010
 another person but even if he is not 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.090
 we are alone in the 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.700
 session 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.950
 this car is going to be there is worth then 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.840
 ok convention if the king called this car 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.150
 the car borrows because 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.610
 we can simply use it to give us 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.370
 a round out there for the saints but 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.130
 no more 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.250
 and put it in the garage a trick of putting a 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.320
 luxury street car to the garage then 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.389
 would be good and then that car what 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:42.240
 we will find between 10 to 12 m worth 12 10 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.430
 at 12 am and I think that mo pm then 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.070
 well as I will find it I will 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.860
