the printed images there they're not

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.400 
the printed images there they're not
like<00:02:25.560> pixelated<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.580> would<00:02:27.390> say<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.170> were

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
like pixelated I would say if you were

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.910 
like pixelated I would say if you were
any<00:02:28.680> bigger<00:02:28.920> than<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.220> 12<00:02:29.490> mil<00:02:29.820> by<00:02:30.300> half<00:02:30.540> an<00:02:30.690> inch

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
any bigger than a 12 mil by half an inch

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.230 
any bigger than a 12 mil by half an inch
not<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.250> any<00:02:32.520> bigger<00:02:32.640> than<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.030> because

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
not to go any bigger than that because

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
not to go any bigger than that because
maybe<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.810> image<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.230> grow<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.860> bit

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
maybe the image would grow a little bit

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.670 
maybe the image would grow a little bit
distorted<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.910> pixelated<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.530> B<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
distorted and pixelated and what B is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.660
