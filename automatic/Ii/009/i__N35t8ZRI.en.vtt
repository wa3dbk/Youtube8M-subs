00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.910
 you pass goals welcome back here to 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.529
 battlefront universe is greater than gaming 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.779
 let's play like an empire have 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.619
 these robots air france 2 invading 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.660
 here the xanthi 4 this map cites that the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.910
 it's really cool, although it's really not 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.440
 be nothing physically correct because 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.360
 to start if they were a real bird 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.160
 this should be symmetric but 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 well who's in charge are we here for 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.510
 hit a beating here with the empire 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.650
 my mother the truth that the bots in the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.140
 battle backgrounds seem to me much more 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.680
 fools that the boat but not if you put 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.290
 in the battle from or not to the bots in the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.420
 elite level you really have an enemy 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.720
 the truth moderately good form 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.229
 to see formidable you end up doing 50 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.430
 80 casualties or with the tip of the cipote but 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.610
 at least it's not like this that you 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 you can access the whole army just 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.310
 they have told me many times in plan 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 of me talking about my death records 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the putt front 1 and 14 comes but 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 I 've done more than that in the bat 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.890
 funds already perfect of funds is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
 made a lot easier 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 is that others so much so so 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.800
 obviously inept that gives me time 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.110
 they attacked 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 In short, one thing I wanted to discuss with 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
 all of you is the date on which 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.690
 could the new star wars come out 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.970
 battlefront on the part of dais because it is 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.590
 what are you thinking I say 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.140
 supposedly it is something that is at par 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.760
 that the film is not should take the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.830
 new star or peace of the front along with the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.700
 movie of episode 7 of star wars 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.170
 which is actually quite curious by 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 the issue of how good supposedly 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.830
 both are designed for 2015 thing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.100
 is that I think I heard that the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.230
 movie is going to delay until 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.080
 early 2016 or that at least 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.940
 are going to be the end of 2015 then I 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.920
 I wonder if they will not take more then 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.260
 try to take out the game so that it 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 right according to the movie so I 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.690
 I would like that in the comments I 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.460
 say if you think he's going to try 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.430
 coordinate the movie with the video game 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.230
 because if you remember the front 2 toilet 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.220
 coordinated with episode 3 of star 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.850
 wars then it makes a lot of sense 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.700
 of course it is to try to use your 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.100
 please as much as possible all the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.240
 new fashion from star wars but of course 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.130
 also if they do they should have 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.140
 ready then soldiers say the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.970
 new ones that are going to come out in episode 7 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.860
 that is, there should be a new era 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.380
 apart from the clone wars and the war 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.720
 galactic civil since the time of which 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.790
 I think he's going to address the issue that is the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.740
 new the second galactic civil war 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 do not pay much attention to me, I do not know what 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.350
 to treat episode 7 but I believe by 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.670
 certain private information that I have 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.860
 that will deal with the second thank you 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.410
 galactic I think I think so I have 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.580
 counted I think but I do not have it either 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.260
 totally safe 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.480
 It is supposedly after the first 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.240
 galactic civil war there is a second and 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.220
 in fact they went out and tell drawings 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.300
 drawings the conceptual art some 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.310
 bullshit like that would be in the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.320
 new helmets of the stormtroopers or 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.300
 let's say this guy is plant 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.520
 imperial soldier as the clone of 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.970
 episode 2 the clone of episode 3 and the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.510
 imperial we see in episodes 4 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.400
 5 and 6 then it will evolve again and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.930
 is going to have another look or is going to change 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.550
 a little the uniform but these soldiers 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.890
 we will continue to have white 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.060
 so that reinforces my theory that 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.000
 will be about the second war 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.920
 galactic civilian may not then 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.050
 also to know what they have done with the 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.880
 script maybe have changed from 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.680
 how is the universe expanded but 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.170
 it would make sense would make sense that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.300
 Out of that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.130
 and the truth is that with how slow they are 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.220
 teaching us information because they are very 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.790
 careful two years ago we have them 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.760
 they showed a 30- second teaser no no 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.610
 no no or ten seconds or not 30 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.790
 seconds and this year one minute and 30 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.950
 ok or they gave us two years ago a 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.579
 teaser and this year a trailer but no more 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.310
 information 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.689
 not even loose photos then what 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.699
 you better be doing the game 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:29.699
 very carefully with a lot of dedication 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.860
 but very calmly which is something that 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.659
 we would not like it, not because 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.460
 take it easy after how much 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:39.560
 ten years and the axis is worth 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.000
 but I do not know man of course I think that 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.740
 it's going to be a good game but I would like 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.990
 namely the comments you think that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.030
 you think what will coordinate with the movie and 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.759
 also maybe they are taking maybe 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.590
 more than they should if it's like that because 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.840
 I would love to get the game out 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.849
 in 2015 surely and that then already if the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.099
 movie is still delayed 2016 because 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.599
 is done in 2016 so nothing fits 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.460
 this conversation and this game for 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.460
 telmo like and see you in the next
