have<00:00:25.350> been<00:00:25.500> very<00:00:25.650> confused<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.370> what

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
have been very confused as to what

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.670 
have been very confused as to what
exactly<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> SG<00:00:27.720> pro<00:00:27.930> star<00:00:28.200> pattern<00:00:28.530> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
exactly the SG pro star pattern is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160 
exactly the SG pro star pattern is
designed<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.340> used<00:00:29.610> on<00:00:29.850> and<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:30.900> simple

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
designed to be used on and the simple

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
designed to be used on and the simple
answer<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.219> soft<00:00:32.460> ground<00:00:32.850> just

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
answer to that is for soft ground just

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
answer to that is for soft ground just
because<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.079> an<00:00:34.199> inclusion<00:00:34.499> of<00:00:34.710> plastic

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
because there is an inclusion of plastic

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.189 
because there is an inclusion of plastic
molded<00:00:35.579> studs<00:00:35.789> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.179> shoe<00:00:36.359> does<00:00:36.839> not<00:00:37.019> mean

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
molded studs on the shoe does not mean

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.590 
molded studs on the shoe does not mean
that<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.710> use<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.159> on<00:00:38.460> fermium<00:00:39.059> hard

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that you can use these on fermium hard

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
that you can use these on fermium hard
ground<00:00:39.870> or<00:00:40.079> even<00:00:40.109> artificial<00:00:40.829> grass<00:00:41.039> not<00:00:41.730> only

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
ground or even artificial grass not only

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610 
ground or even artificial grass not only
is<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.179> not<00:00:42.449> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.659> perform<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.440> well

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is it not going to perform all that well

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.049 
is it not going to perform all that well
because<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.249> designed<00:00:44.609> for<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> plain

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
because it's not designed for that plain

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
because it's not designed for that plain
surface<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.050> also<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> cause

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
surface but it's also going to cause

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.619 
surface but it's also going to cause
harm<00:00:47.069> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.429> shoe<00:00:47.609> in<00:00:47.789> terms<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.089> durability

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
harm to the shoe in terms of durability

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
harm to the shoe in terms of durability
and<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.079> also<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.499> be<00:00:49.589> very<00:00:49.829> very

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
and it's also going to be very very
uncomfortable<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.140> very

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
way you can't buy shorter plastic studs

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.480 
way you can't buy shorter plastic studs
that<00:02:26.900> are<00:02:27.170> gonna<00:02:27.350> fit<00:02:27.530> properly<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.280> shoe

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
that are gonna fit properly in the shoe

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.190 
that are gonna fit properly in the shoe
I've<00:02:28.640> tried<00:02:29.000> I've<00:02:29.210> looked<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.750> there's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I've tried I've looked and there's

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.270 
I've tried I've looked and there's
really<00:02:30.290> nothing<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.100> buy<00:02:31.250> out

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
really nothing that you can buy out

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.230 
really nothing that you can buy out
there<00:02:31.490> that's<00:02:31.880> gonna<00:02:33.310> mimic<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.610> feel<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.880> a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
there that's gonna mimic the feel of a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.180 
there that's gonna mimic the feel of a
standard<00:02:35.690> molded<00:02:36.110> stud

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
standard molded stud

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.850 
standard molded stud
so<00:02:37.840> replacing<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> studs<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.290> use<00:02:39.470> them<00:02:39.680> on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
so replacing the studs to use them on

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.440 
so replacing the studs to use them on
harder<00:02:40.310> surfaces<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.000> definitely<00:02:41.330> not

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
harder surfaces it's definitely not

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
harder surfaces it's definitely not
something<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.840> want<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.080> do<00:02:42.260> also<00:02:43.010> keep<00:02:43.190> in

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
something you want to do also keep in

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.680 
something you want to do also keep in
mind<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.610> because<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> screw<00:02:44.540> in

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
mind that because you have a screw in

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.630 
mind that because you have a screw in
section<00:02:45.110> there<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.740> somewhere<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> stud

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
section there is somewhere for the stud

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.490 
section there is somewhere for the stud
to<00:02:46.670> actually<00:02:47.090> screw<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.050> shoe<00:02:48.200> itself

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to actually screw in on the shoe itself

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620 
to actually screw in on the shoe itself
so<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.130> automatically<00:02:50.000> creates<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.420> pressure

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so that automatically creates a pressure

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.090 
so that automatically creates a pressure
point<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.500> you're<00:02:51.590> gonna<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.770> playing<00:02:51.980> on

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
point and if you're gonna be playing on

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.980 
point and if you're gonna be playing on
harder<00:02:52.400> surfaces<00:02:52.820> it's<00:02:53.240> gonna<00:02:53.390> be<00:02:53.540> very<00:02:53.780> very

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
harder surfaces it's gonna be very very

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.030 
harder surfaces it's gonna be very very
noticeable<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:54.620> you're<00:02:54.770> running<00:02:54.890> around

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
noticeable when you're running around

than that that's pretty much it as far

have<00:04:22.940> your<00:04:23.150> two<00:04:23.330> studs<00:04:23.570> at<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.780> start<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
have your two studs at the start of the

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.469 
have your two studs at the start of the
forefoot<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.039> one<00:04:25.250> stud<00:04:25.520> on<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.820> side<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
forefoot the one stud on the side the

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.820 
forefoot the one stud on the side the
one<00:04:26.660> push<00:04:26.900> off<00:04:27.080> stud<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.470> then

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
one push off stud and then

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.050 
one push off stud and then
the<00:04:28.009> one<00:04:28.159> support<00:04:28.580> stud<00:04:28.789> if<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.449> notice<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
the one support stud if you notice the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.399 
the one support stud if you notice the
Maestri<00:04:32.060> has<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.360> exact<00:04:32.689> same<00:04:32.720> side<00:04:33.169> pattern

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
Maestri has the exact same side pattern

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.499 
Maestri has the exact same side pattern
and<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.009> does<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.400> laser<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:35.180> there's<00:04:35.389> no

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
and so does the laser so there's no

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.390 
and so does the laser so there's no
difference<00:04:35.870> between<00:04:35.900> these<00:04:36.289> three<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:37.039> only

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
difference between these three the only

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.559 
difference between these three the only
variation<00:04:37.909> is<00:04:38.030> going<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.330> come<00:04:38.539> from<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
variation is going to come from the

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.480 
variation is going to come from the
Mercurial<00:04:41.569> Vapor<00:04:41.689> eight<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.229> even<00:04:42.500> then<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
Mercurial Vapor eight and even then the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.800 
Mercurial Vapor eight and even then the
studs<00:04:43.759> are<00:04:43.879> a<00:04:43.909> little<00:04:44.060> bit<00:04:44.270> different<00:04:44.419> shaped

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
studs are a little bit different shaped

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.869 
studs are a little bit different shaped
but<00:04:45.500> there's<00:04:45.770> no<00:04:45.919> actual<00:04:46.340> difference<00:04:46.669> in<00:04:46.789> the

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
but there's no actual difference in the

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.490 
but there's no actual difference in the
formation<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.449> have<00:04:47.569> bladed<00:04:48.020> studs<00:04:48.110> instead

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
formation you have bladed studs instead

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.749 
formation you have bladed studs instead
of<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.710> rounded<00:04:49.009> studs<00:04:49.219> here<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.580> heel

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
of the rounded studs here in the heel

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.909 
of the rounded studs here in the heel
you<00:04:50.270> have<00:04:50.389> your<00:04:50.509> two<00:04:50.629> bladed<00:04:50.930> studs<00:04:51.020> here<00:04:51.409> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
you have your two bladed studs here the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.260 
you have your two bladed studs here the
one<00:04:52.069> here<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.460> one<00:04:52.580> supports<00:04:52.969> ed<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
one here the one supports ed in the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.219 
one here the one supports ed in the
middle<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.629> then<00:04:53.719> of<00:04:53.810> course<00:04:53.840> your<00:04:54.110> one

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
middle and then of course your one

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.200 
middle and then of course your one
bladed<00:04:54.620> toe<00:04:54.800> off<00:04:54.979> stud<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.909> that's<00:04:56.030> really

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
bladed toe off stud so that's really

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.920 
bladed toe off stud so that's really
only<00:04:56.719> difference<00:04:57.080> here<00:04:57.139> as<00:04:57.639> far<00:04:58.639> as<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:59.689> stud

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
only difference here as far as the stud

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.330 
only difference here as far as the stud
patterns<00:05:00.259> themselves<00:05:00.379> they<00:05:00.770> all<00:05:00.919> tend<00:05:01.250> to

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
patterns themselves they all tend to

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.800 
patterns themselves they all tend to
perform<00:05:01.490> pretty<00:05:01.849> much<00:05:02.060> at<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.270> same<00:05:02.300> level

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
perform pretty much at the same level

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.029 
perform pretty much at the same level
and<00:05:02.930> feel<00:05:03.139> about<00:05:03.379> the<00:05:03.530> same<00:05:03.740> when<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.009> are

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
and feel about the same when you are

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.249 
and feel about the same when you are
wearing<00:05:04.400> them<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:04.669> soft<00:05:04.940> ground<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:06.050> there's

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
wearing them on soft ground so there's

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.589 
wearing them on soft ground so there's
really<00:05:06.409> not<00:05:06.680> much<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:06.949> a<00:05:07.159> difference<00:05:07.280> there<00:05:07.699> as

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
really not much of a difference there as

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.909 
really not much of a difference there as
far<00:05:08.750> as<00:05:08.810> what<00:05:08.960> else<00:05:09.139> is<00:05:09.289> included<00:05:09.440> in<00:05:09.830> the

as well which I'll show you guys and
that<00:05:43.940> is<00:05:44.120> what<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.389> stud<00:05:44.569> branch<00:05:44.779> would<00:05:44.870> look

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
that is what the stud branch would look

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.879 
that is what the stud branch would look
like<00:05:45.259> it<00:05:45.500> says<00:05:46.569> Nike<00:05:47.569> football<00:05:47.990> comm<00:05:48.469> on<00:05:48.680> there
