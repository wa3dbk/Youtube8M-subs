00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
quarterback card in the game so i would

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.330 
quarterback card in the game so i would
rather<00:05:13.750> have<00:05:14.020> him<00:05:14.260> than<00:05:14.290> any<00:05:14.800> other<00:05:15.010> card

except for that John Elway that's

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.640 
except for that John Elway that's
probably<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.080> only<00:05:17.140> one<00:05:17.350> I<00:05:17.380> would<00:05:17.500> rather

other receiver I would rather have to go
as<00:05:24.130> number<00:05:24.460> one<00:05:24.610> receiver<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:25.090> number<00:05:25.390> two

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
as number one receiver a number two

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.950 
as number one receiver a number two
receiver<00:05:25.660> would<00:05:26.530> either<00:05:26.680> be<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:28.510> 99

Jerry<00:05:29.290> Ross<00:05:29.640> that's<00:05:30.640> probably<00:05:30.850> about<00:05:30.940> the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
Jerry Ross that's probably about the
