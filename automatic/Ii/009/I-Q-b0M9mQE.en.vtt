00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.549
 I got quite on Twitter last week 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.130
 care about my life for the father 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.349
 and all the neat club you mentioned the general 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.119
 director jos who are good one mentioned 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.550
 our back that duo 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.779
 that's right and try through the hashtag 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.579
 after-talk 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.189
 the whole night community buzzed up 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:27.160
 put everything whatever happened I say 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.020
 there on a response postscript man me 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 have to go to breda tomorrow i will be 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.250
 linked it so well we are ugly about it 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.809
 you do just once with groceries 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.790
 mother is in breda 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.199
 yes I do go to the tilburg now but yes 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.149
 of course i'm going to tilburg 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.489
 looking does not seem like a beating though 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.050
 but once in a while we are threatened and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.449
 not that not 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.530
 in fact there are many people who 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.969
 say 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.550
 and you should go sometime 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.350
 come along to the evening's NAC compete 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.090
 but we want there I want there I want 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.110
 against Willem 2, then I want the der die op 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.449
 my hair beautiful 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.579
 nat willem 2 is actually unjustified 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.559
 a bit the the the idea originated by 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.710
 by the the cut in it 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.119
 video that we also supporters 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.759
 find it sad but we think so 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.229
 we are not alone sad 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.970
 what the club 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.440
 the supporters now only offers 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.630
 I don't understand that those supporters are angry 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.850
 is because we actually say 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 club has been poorly managed for years this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.450
 leads to degradation and then the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.270
 supporters upset so we are 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.950
 actually the finger on the pulse at NAC 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.800
 and that is not appreciated by the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.270
 well, I support business blind people 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.159
 find that a very nice cool club 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.600
 but speaking of that that can do 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.460
 to break 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.460
 jelle ten mourning I see it he 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.479
 blame my after 19 times a season 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.619
 let the ball hit the short corner 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.970
 Get on 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.950
 You can also say you know what we do 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.539
 set up a goalkeeper who is not mad 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.979
 but safe 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.770
 You know what I mean? I understand exactly 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.869
 what you mean because jelle die die die 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.520
 has field interaction on the field with 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.450
 supporter let your pocket had 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.570
 couple diving 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.950
 but closely follows this competition come along 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 in front of the camera because he always does that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 obliged again to address this afternoon 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
 and they that way on two goals that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.410
 I should have 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.110
 is that something you a player on one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.549
 goalkeeper are advising to be so honest 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.500
 are at the edge of the field 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.090
 yes i would do it yes yes everyone 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.130
 has seen it additionally 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.570
 and it but it is also smart to 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.269
 but then everyone says look 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.700
 agree what these eyepiece footballs what a 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.350
 hero who just made mistakes who 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.209
 and the power you stay here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.640
 stand 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.530
 ergo we totally agree with it 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 night wet and so when there is it especially 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.710

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
 reaction to twitter of fanzine the rat 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.110

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.050

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
