00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.520 

they're<00:00:23.830> charging<00:00:24.250> voltage<00:00:25.200> just<00:00:26.200> under<00:00:26.500> a

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
they're charging voltage just under a

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.080 
they're charging voltage just under a

right and almost a thousand rpm all
right<00:01:07.390> this<00:01:07.600> alternator<00:01:08.110> here<00:01:08.380> I<00:01:08.619> painted<00:01:09.250> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
right this alternator here I painted I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.749 
right this alternator here I painted I
built<00:01:11.009> I'm<00:01:12.009> going<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.250> show<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.369> how<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.640> build

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
built I'm going to show you how to build

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.230 
built I'm going to show you how to build
this<00:01:12.909> this<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.270> not<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.540> PMA<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.880> actually

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
this this is not a PMA this is actually

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.840 
this this is not a PMA this is actually
an<00:01:16.330> alternator<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.040> woman<00:01:18.340> wire<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.790> all

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
an alternator it's a woman wire so all

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.160 
an alternator it's a woman wire so all
you<00:01:18.940> have<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.149> do<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.450> have<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.659> positive

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
you have to do is have a positive

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.810 
you have to do is have a positive
battery<00:01:20.320> cable<00:01:20.470> here<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.250> ground<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.729> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
battery cable here on the ground to the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.990 
battery cable here on the ground to the
body<00:01:22.090> somewhere<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:24.190> will<00:01:24.340> torch<00:01:24.610> you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
body somewhere and it will torch you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.450 
body somewhere and it will torch you
don't<00:01:25.119> have<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.330> use<00:01:25.450> these<00:01:25.570> plugs<00:01:29.369> got<00:01:30.369> this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
don't have to use these plugs got this

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.040 
don't have to use these plugs got this
little<00:01:30.610> tester<00:01:31.179> here<00:01:31.300> didn't<00:01:31.630> work<00:01:31.780> for<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
little tester here didn't work for the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.400 
little tester here didn't work for the
practice<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> meter<00:01:34.539> up<00:01:34.720> here<00:01:34.929> it's<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.200> volt

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
practice got a meter up here it's a volt

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.740 
practice got a meter up here it's a volt
off<00:01:35.649> but<00:01:36.130> what<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.460> does<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.119> backs<00:01:37.330> up<00:01:37.570> this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
off but what it does is it backs up this

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.300 
off but what it does is it backs up this
one<00:01:37.990> because<00:01:38.440> I<00:01:38.530> know<00:01:38.590> it's<00:01:38.830> exactly<00:01:39.220> the

soldiers hub blades in place but you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.090 
soldiers hub blades in place but you
could<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> gear<00:02:17.200> reduction<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> save

yourself a whole lot of money by using
this<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.950> has<00:02:21.220> its<00:02:21.430> downfalls<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:22.560> uses

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
this it has its downfalls it uses

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.550 
this it has its downfalls it uses
brushes<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.070> downfall<00:02:28.530> as<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
brushes so that's a downfall as a

that<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.440> PMA<00:02:32.860> doesn't<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:33.700> control

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
that a PMA doesn't but you can control

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.990 
that a PMA doesn't but you can control
the<00:02:34.269> voltage<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.930> don't<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the voltage and you don't have to have a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.080 
the voltage and you don't have to have a
load<00:02:37.780> diversion<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.610> it'll

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
load diversion because it'll

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.150 
load diversion because it'll
automatically<00:02:40.540> adjust<00:02:40.930> itself<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.620> where

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
just spinning it it won't add any more

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.550 
just spinning it it won't add any more
to<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.970> baby<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.870> knows<00:02:47.050> whether<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.380> shed

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
to the baby it knows whether to shed

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.320 
to the baby it knows whether to shed
itself<00:02:47.830> off<00:02:50.489> these<00:02:51.489> things<00:02:51.700> are<00:02:51.850> designed<00:02:51.970> to

itself off these things are designed to
protect<00:02:52.540> 8,000<00:02:53.320> rpm<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.980> ain't<00:02:54.040> gotta

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
protect 8,000 rpm so you ain't gotta

worry<00:02:54.370> about<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.700> coming<00:02:54.880> apart<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:56.320> good

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
worry about it coming apart it's good

easily maintenance it that way but I'm
going<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.630> show<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.810> how<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.959> take<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.290> thing

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
going to show you how to take this thing

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.810 
going to show you how to take this thing
apart<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:07.530> how<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> built<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:09.730> you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
apart and how I built it and what you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.199 
apart and how I built it and what you
got<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.450> build<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.850> I'm<00:03:12.850> gonna<00:03:13.060> be

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
got to have to build it and I'm gonna be

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.720 
got to have to build it and I'm gonna be
working<00:03:13.570> on<00:03:13.690> another<00:03:13.930> project<00:03:14.799> trying<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.579> get

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
working on another project trying to get

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.770 
working on another project trying to get
that<00:03:15.970> actual<00:03:16.870> charging<00:03:17.350> voltage<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:19.600> be<00:03:19.750> a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that actual charging voltage to be a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.720 
that actual charging voltage to be a
work<00:03:20.410> should<00:03:20.680> be<00:03:20.860> when<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.310> thing's<00:03:21.519> running

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
work should be when this thing's running

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.860 
work should be when this thing's running
about<00:03:22.000> five<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.590> six<00:03:23.799> hundred<00:03:23.920> rpms<00:03:24.870> right

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
about five it's a six hundred rpms right

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.780 
about five it's a six hundred rpms right
now<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.290> kicks<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.680> at<00:03:26.829> about<00:03:27.010> 500<00:03:27.579> games

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
now it kicks in at about 500 games

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.020 
now it kicks in at about 500 games
actually<00:03:28.299> starts<00:03:28.840> out<00:03:29.340> later<00:03:30.340> starts<00:03:30.820> in

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
actually starts out later starts in

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.539 
actually starts out later starts in
about<00:03:31.209> five<00:03:31.420> hundred<00:03:31.540> rpms<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.280> doesn't

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
about five hundred rpms but it doesn't

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.550 
about five hundred rpms but it doesn't
actually<00:03:33.640> put<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.150> charging<00:03:34.810> voltage<00:03:34.989> till

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
actually put out charging voltage till

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.190 
actually put out charging voltage till
almost<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.299> hair<00:03:37.510> under<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.810> thousand

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
almost just just a hair under a thousand

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.010 
almost just just a hair under a thousand
rpms

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
rpms

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.110 
rpms
