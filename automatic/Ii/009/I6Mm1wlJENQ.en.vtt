00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.490
 When it comes to additional batteries for iOS devices 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.109
 has gone with power in the last few years 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.760
 months made by its exceptions 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 actually recognizes them in these 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.469
 these very beautiful vivid colors and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 they have the big ones 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.020
 palette of various additional batteries and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.480
 Battery cases currently three relatively new 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 models of those on the table you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 here complement to article times briefly 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 video show the details are there 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.800
 then also with everything in the praise 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 then article on al van de but here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 that you also saw the things 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:40.399
 let's start with the smallest of which is 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.649
 here a battery case for the iphone 4 or 4 s 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.850
 and it's the thinnest battery 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 case at all I have now 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 but you see it is now 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 important times I guess I know 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 not if the battery is actually there 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.160
 in there or down here 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.590
 The battery itself is here on it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 maybe a little brighter will be exactly 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.980
 The battery itself is comparatively 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.409
 relatively weak at 1200 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 millipetours so the way forward 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.970
 you can not get the iphone 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 fully charged but maybe too 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.689
 Two-thirds or so will do 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 if your iphone is completely empty for it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.900
 Do you have the advantage here of the thing so 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.950
 So good as not at all so minimal 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.600
 annoying if that's what it does 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 iphone keep ticking longer through the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.570
 adapter down here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 you have a dock connection 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 it goes on and then it goes on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 micro usb to charge connection and the the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.280
 You can neglect strength and it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 are the scope of delivery of two more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 plastic things for the top with them 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 he fixes the iphone above 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.040
 different white as us four 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.880
 up here slightly different from the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.439
 recesses are my only one 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 Critic point I find this plastic 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.799
 things up there a bit stupid if 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.939
 we're on top of that, you have to 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.810
 that again click on it 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.950
 but it is free from the expense of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.189
 stress in borders 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.159
 Do you stop so as I said the loud 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.640
 manufacturer thinnest case for iphone 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.470
 with 1200 million as emergency charging station 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.090
 we would have here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.680
 behind the switch still and in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.290
 scope of delivery as I said these two 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.760
 covers and a charging cable from usb 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.820
 also micro-usb this could be a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.930
 system could be usb port on any notebook 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.970
 or anywhere else 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.140
 it continues in the text with the back 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.510
 left this is the power tube us one 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.240
 a bit ran 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.770
 Here I have a relatively compact 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.330
 round battery that I actually quite 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.260
 feels nice and pulls it a bit 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.060
 Like a flashlight 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.940
 you see up there is now a blue one 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.610
 led that is a small one small 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
 play with this battery when I die 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.520
 title if you pick up then 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 the led goes up here for a short time 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.030
 and shows me by the color of the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.490
 Charge faith means, for example 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.660
 that at least 70 percent charge still 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.810
 in it is in this part 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 in total it has the capacity of 2,600 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 milliampere that means you have here 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.050
 In any case, minimum one iphone 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.430
 charge in it as a compact perhaps 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.220
 also relatively good the pants pocket or 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.220
 anywhere else pluggable accessories now 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.620
 out of respect now again 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.680
 here is still one in the scope of delivery 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 small bag with it 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 Carrying bags will need it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.230
 with just this set of cables so me 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.350
 once have a USB cable for the charge 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.630
 So hereby I can the battery at each 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.489
 Connect and charge the USB port 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.350
 and the other cables are just there 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.310
 to charge devices so with micro usb 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.850
 mini usb connection cable and here still 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.519
 a female usb connection there I can 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.780
 Now for example dock connector cable 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.820
 plug in from apple or something 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.690
 other 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.880
 that would be like this power tube 2600 goes 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.989
 said 2600 milliamps twice as much 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.260
 as this one 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.080
 and last but not least, back here 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:11.150
 on the right is flagship the current one 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:14.790
 power tube 5,500 5,505 in focus 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.330
 5,500 milliamps so almost again 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.400
 the double of this power tube and 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.260
 that's the only one of those three 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.750
 Battery with which I load from ipad 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.610
 it had enough power for ipad 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.490
 and should definitely have several charges 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.260
 for the iphone make with this performance 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.000
 I also can not do it now 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.320
 say how many how many times the ipad 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 probably as an ipad just once 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.540
 so that's what industries are clear 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.570
 more 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.320
 but it is a proud powerhouse 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.880
 relatively compact, but also up here 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.600
 just a USB connection and the thing 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.980
 recharge or re-energize 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.050
 you have the opportunity here with this one 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.670
 button here, so to speak, the ring to light up 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.440
 to bring the loading control 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.480
 have you and what else here in one 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.060
 little the little gimmick is when 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.720
 I push it longer goes one here 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.410
 LED flashlight 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.540
 I would have made it like that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.280
 said mika es flagship 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.040
 in the scope of delivery in it different cables 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.260
 to charge the team resp 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.570
 to release the charging voltage again and 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.460
 then here's a whole course for 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.060
 ios the necessary cables and then but still 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.380
 a whole set of any adapters with 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.840
 we probably all possible 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.360
 cell phones and navigation devices whatever 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.890
 Charging can what's just that is 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.510
 he looks better on the manufacturer side 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.930
 after which you can you now based here 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.510
 This plug just say so 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:49.170
 more information about these batteries now too 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.390
 in the article on the iphone ticker.de too 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.500
 the links to the manufacturer and prices and 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.160
 everything you need 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.160
 Thank you
