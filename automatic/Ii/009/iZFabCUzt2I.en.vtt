honestly<00:00:39.239> advanced<00:00:39.960> warfare<00:00:40.410> seems<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
honestly advanced warfare seems to be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.889 
honestly advanced warfare seems to be
the<00:00:41.399> card<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.730> actually<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the card that actually is going to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.240 
the card that actually is going to
change<00:00:43.110> few<00:00:43.410> things<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> looks<00:00:44.129> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
change few things from the looks of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.310 
change few things from the looks of
things<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.789> won't<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> crazy<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.989> it'll<00:00:46.289> be

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
things and won't be crazy but it'll be

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760

little<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.180> mainly<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:49.260> movement

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
little things and mainly I see movement

little things and mainly I see movement
quad<00:00:50.280> feeds<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.940> ranking<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> eyes<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.350> most

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
quad feeds I ranking in the eyes of most

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
quad feeds I ranking in the eyes of most
people<00:00:52.949> sitting<00:00:53.670> still<00:00:53.910> five<00:00:54.180> owns<00:00:54.390> and

you'll see this that these are a lot of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
you'll see this that these are a lot of
split<00:00:56.640> clips<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.750> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
doing fancy maneuvers in the air and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
doing fancy maneuvers in the air and I
mean<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.420> person<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.840> guys<00:01:04.229> probably<00:01:04.530> know

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
mean one person you guys probably know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
mean one person you guys probably know
who's<00:01:05.010> done<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.519> you've<00:01:05.640> probably<00:01:05.850> seen

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
who's done this and you've probably seen

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
who's done this and you've probably seen
his<00:01:06.180> first<00:01:06.360> montage<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.840> blue<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> blue<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> my

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
his first montage is blue and blue in my

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.380 
his first montage is blue and blue in my
opinion<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> probably<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> best<00:01:09.119> player<00:01:09.299> in

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
opinion is probably the best player in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
opinion is probably the best player in
this<00:01:09.540> game<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> able<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this game just because he is able to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
this game just because he is able to
move<00:01:11.189> around<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.240> while<00:01:12.600> still<00:01:12.840> being

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
move around so well while still being

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
move around so well while still being
accurate<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.820> movement<00:01:15.180> stuff

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
accurate and it's this movement stuff

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
accurate and it's this movement stuff
that<00:01:15.810> makes<00:01:16.020> advanced<00:01:16.380> warfare<00:01:16.799> fun<00:01:17.100> even

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that makes advanced warfare fun even

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
that makes advanced warfare fun even
when<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.060> reckoning<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> game<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> fun

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
when I'm reckoning if the game is fun

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.830 
when I'm reckoning if the game is fun
because<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.909> reg<00:01:21.180> gunning<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:21.720> I'm

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because I'm reg gunning it because I'm

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
because I'm reg gunning it because I'm
moving<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.409> around<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.890> place<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> because

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
moving all around the place and because

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
moving all around the place and because
I'm<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.790> absolutely<00:01:24.030> mental<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I'm going absolutely mental I'm just

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
I'm going absolutely mental I'm just
going<00:01:26.100> crazy<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.670> jumping<00:01:27.090> around<00:01:27.180> people

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
going crazy and jumping around people

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
going crazy and jumping around people
and<00:01:27.689> dodging<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> strafing<00:01:28.920> backwards<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and dodging and strafing backwards and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
and dodging and strafing backwards and
forwards<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.299> interesting<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
forwards it's just very interesting to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
forwards it's just very interesting to
watch<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> play<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.210> where

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
watch and play and I think that's where

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.670 
watch and play and I think that's where
advanced<00:01:33.689> warfare<00:01:34.020> has<00:01:34.170> its<00:01:34.350> strengths

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
advanced warfare has its strengths

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
advanced warfare has its strengths
because<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.600> long<00:01:37.140> year<00:01:37.200> if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because it is going to be a long year if

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
because it is going to be a long year if
people<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.420> try<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> same

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
people are going to try and do the same

seven<00:01:43.979> years<00:01:44.220> we've<00:01:44.610> had<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.939> same<00:01:45.210> sort<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
seven years we've had the same sort of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.830 
seven years we've had the same sort of

to<00:04:13.799> see<00:04:13.919> how<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.010> turns<00:04:14.130> out<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.549> only<00:04:14.579> sad

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
to see how this turns out the only sad

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.640 
to see how this turns out the only sad
but<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.450> obviously<00:04:15.810> only<00:04:15.959> one<00:04:16.079> recruit

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
but is is obviously only one recruit

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.920 
but is is obviously only one recruit
because<00:04:16.979> phases<00:04:17.639> roster<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.150> really<00:04:18.630> stacking

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
because phases roster is really stacking

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.500 
because phases roster is really stacking
at<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.349> moment<00:04:19.680> i<00:04:19.769> suppose<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.450> hopefully<00:04:21.450> in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
at the moment i suppose but hopefully in

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.880 
at the moment i suppose but hopefully in
the<00:04:21.539> future<00:04:21.690> more<00:04:22.079> advanced<00:04:22.289> warfare<00:04:22.650> players

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
the future more advanced warfare players

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.290 
the future more advanced warfare players
get<00:04:23.159> recruited<00:04:23.520> because<00:04:23.610> i<00:04:23.789> think<00:04:23.849> this<00:04:24.150> game

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
get recruited because i think this game

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.080 
get recruited because i think this game
is<00:04:24.360> gonna<00:04:24.539> really<00:04:24.960> show<00:04:25.520> who<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.669> good<00:04:26.909> and<00:04:27.030> who

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
is gonna really show who is good and who

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.450 
is gonna really show who is good and who
is

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
is

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.180 
is
then<00:04:27.610> from<00:04:28.270> what<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.660> seems<00:04:28.960> at<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.620> phase<00:04:29.830> one

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
then from what it seems at the phase one

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.640 
then from what it seems at the phase one
there<00:04:30.970> is<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> lot<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.600> people<00:04:31.900> who<00:04:32.199> are<00:04:32.319> able<00:04:32.590> to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
there is a lot of people who are able to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.529 
there is a lot of people who are able to
take<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.009> one<00:04:33.250> spot<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.789> it's<00:04:33.910> gonna<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.180> down

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
take that one spot so it's gonna be down

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.969 
take that one spot so it's gonna be down
to<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:34.870> happens<00:04:35.199> in<00:04:35.319> the<00:04:35.350> next<00:04:35.410> three<00:04:35.740> weeks
