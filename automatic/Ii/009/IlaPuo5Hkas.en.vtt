all right as promised we're going to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.340 
all right as promised we're going to
learn<00:00:04.380> now<00:00:05.069> how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.400> do<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.910> dog<00:00:06.120> body<00:00:06.450> which

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
learn now how to do the dog body which

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.620 
learn now how to do the dog body which
is<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.649> little<00:00:08.639> bit<00:00:08.790> more<00:00:08.910> simple<00:00:09.330> than<00:00:09.360> doing

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
is a little bit more simple than doing

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.430 
is a little bit more simple than doing
the<00:00:09.690> dog<00:00:09.929> head<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:12.300> wire<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.870> came<00:00:13.230> off<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the dog head the wire that came off of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.680 
the dog head the wire that came off of
the<00:00:13.679> kid<00:00:14.299> will<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.330> become<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> nick<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.690> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the kid will just become a nick and the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.099 
the kid will just become a nick and the
neck<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.109> give<00:00:19.289> way<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> legs<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:21.600> legs<00:00:21.779> give

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
neck will give way to legs the legs give

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
neck will give way to legs the legs give
way<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.820> spiral<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> body<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
way to a spiral that is the body and the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.500 
way to a spiral that is the body and the
spiral<00:00:27.090> gives<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.019> hind<00:00:28.410> legs<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
spiral gives way to the hind legs and

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.650 
spiral gives way to the hind legs and
they<00:00:30.510> give<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.500> tail<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> that's<00:00:33.480> what

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
they give way to the tail so that's what

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
they give way to the tail so that's what
we<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.290> that's<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.590> we're<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
we have and that's what we're going to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:47.799 
we have and that's what we're going to
do<00:00:44.090> once<00:00:45.090> again<00:00:45.390> there's<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.809> friend<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
do once again there's our friend and

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.360 
do once again there's our friend and
we're<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.230> bend<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:51.000> wire

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
we're just going to bend this wire

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
we're just going to bend this wire
downward<00:00:53.370> behind<00:00:53.820> him<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.309> when<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.610> not

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
downward behind him and when we're not

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.069 
downward behind him and when we're not
too<00:00:57.300> far<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:59.480> will<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.870> ahead<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
too far down we will just go ahead and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.219 
too far down we will just go ahead and
make<00:01:01.260> legs<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.270> once<00:01:03.270> again<00:01:03.629> i'll<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
make legs out of that once again i'll be

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.550 
make legs out of that once again i'll be
using<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.880> plier<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> bend

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
using the plier is not so much to bend

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.969 
using the plier is not so much to bend
the<00:01:07.770> wire<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.630> subject<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> wire<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.890> i

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the wire but to subject the wire so i

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.880 
the wire but to subject the wire so i
can<00:01:11.130> bend<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> wire<00:01:12.830> with<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:14.040> hand<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:18.890> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can bend the wire with my hand and just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.320 
can bend the wire with my hand and just
going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> create<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.610> legs<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.240> like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to create these legs just like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.020 
going to create these legs just like
you're<00:01:21.630> seeing<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.430> hard<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> do

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you're seeing it's not that hard to do

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
you're seeing it's not that hard to do
it's<00:01:24.240> pretty<00:01:24.720> easy<00:01:24.990> i<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> make<00:01:26.009> sure

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's pretty easy i want to make sure

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's pretty easy i want to make sure
that<00:01:26.460> they're<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:26.970> length<00:01:27.390> though<00:01:27.810> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that they're the same length though so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.219 
that they're the same length though so
they're<00:01:28.229> even<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> easy<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> do

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they're even it's not that easy to do

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
they're even it's not that easy to do
when<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.500> trying<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.040> an<00:01:32.159> exact<00:01:32.640> same

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
when you're trying to get an exact same

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.240 
when you're trying to get an exact same
length<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.500> always<00:01:34.650> bend<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> wire

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
length but you can always bend the wire

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
length but you can always bend the wire
a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.579> bit<00:01:35.670> afterwards<00:01:36.119> tweak<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.689> here

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
a little bit afterwards tweak it here

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.830 
a little bit afterwards tweak it here
and<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.520> get<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> best<00:01:38.880> possible<00:01:40.159> fit

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
and there to get the best possible fit

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
and there to get the best possible fit
ok<00:01:42.840> once<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.189> head<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> these<00:01:44.880> first

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
ok once we have the head and these first

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.590 
ok once we have the head and these first
legs<00:01:45.689> which<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> front<00:01:46.979> legs<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.600> just

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
legs which are the front legs I just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
legs which are the front legs I just
take<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.729> finger<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.799> wrap<00:01:52.799> around<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.310> twice

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
take a finger and wrap around it twice

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.789 
take a finger and wrap around it twice
to<00:01:54.799> create<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.810> spiral<00:01:57.829> that<00:01:58.829> becomes<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> body

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
to create a spiral that becomes the body

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.240 
to create a spiral that becomes the body
and<00:02:01.799> yeah<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.100> could<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.210> take<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> more

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.440 

sophisticated<00:02:08.250> approach<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
sophisticated approach to this and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.290 
sophisticated approach to this and
actually<00:02:09.599> create<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> dog<00:02:10.319> buddy<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:12.090> that's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
actually create a dog buddy but that's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.360 
actually create a dog buddy but that's
not<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.629> we're<00:02:12.780> doing

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
not what we're doing

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.619 
not what we're doing
today<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:15.250> that's<00:02:16.250> that's<00:02:16.819> for<00:02:17.090> another<00:02:17.180> type

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
today so that's that's for another type

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.600 
today so that's that's for another type
of<00:02:17.659> dog<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.959> will<00:02:18.230> do<00:02:18.349> in<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.500> future<00:02:18.610> but

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
of dog that will do in the future but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.520 
of dog that will do in the future but
this<00:02:19.819> spiral<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.510> gives<00:02:20.720> way<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> body

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
this spiral just gives way it's the body

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.180 
this spiral just gives way it's the body
and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.310> gives<00:02:22.519> way<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.360> hind<00:02:23.720> legs<00:02:24.190> so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
and then gives way to the hind legs so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.089 
and then gives way to the hind legs so
the<00:02:25.310> hind<00:02:25.519> legs<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.269> come<00:02:26.510> down<00:02:26.780> once<00:02:27.709> again

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
the hind legs just come down once again

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.850 
the hind legs just come down once again
we<00:02:28.580> try<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.819> make<00:02:29.000> sure<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.450> they're<00:02:29.860> going

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
we try to make sure that they're going

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.140 
we try to make sure that they're going
to<00:02:30.950> be<00:02:31.099> about<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.400> same<00:02:31.579> length<00:02:31.909> as<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to be about the same length as the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.100 
to be about the same length as the
forelegs<00:02:33.340> by<00:02:37.000> setting<00:02:38.000> them<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.599> kind<00:02:39.049> of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
forelegs by setting them up and kind of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.559 
forelegs by setting them up and kind of
measuring<00:02:39.620> where<00:02:39.860> we're<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.329> just

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
measuring where we're at and then just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.030 
measuring where we're at and then just
starting<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.790> subject<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.909> wire<00:02:44.799> bend<00:02:45.799> it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
starting to subject the wire bend it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.300 
starting to subject the wire bend it
into<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.670> v-shape<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:48.379> we<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.739> for<00:02:49.069> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
into the v-shape that we have for the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.460 
into the v-shape that we have for the
four<00:02:50.269> legs<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.250> kind<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.470> w

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
four legs so it's just kind of like a w

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.470 
four legs so it's just kind of like a w
almost<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:58.190> we're<00:02:58.340> creating<00:02:59.140> see<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> W

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
almost that we're creating see the W

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.690 
almost that we're creating see the W
those<00:03:02.480> are<00:03:02.659> the<00:03:02.720> legs<00:03:03.340> now<00:03:05.739> come<00:03:06.739> up<00:03:06.920> use<00:03:07.549> our

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
those are the legs now come up use our

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.280 
those are the legs now come up use our
hands<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.230> create<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.180> hindquarters<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:12.230> to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
hands to create the hindquarters so to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.289 
hands to create the hindquarters so to
speak<00:03:13.150> or<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.599> bottom<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.940> want<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.180> call
