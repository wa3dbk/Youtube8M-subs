00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the Slovak engineer stefan klein managed 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 make your dream come true that your invention 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.769
 the aircar the flying car will carry 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.049
 out your first flight the flying car 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.870
 has the advantage that it can circulate through 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.060
 highway or highway and get to the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 runway of an airport or 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.689
 aerodrome this is a report from our 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.689
 chain allied to the voice of america 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.689
 it is called aircar 2.5 a flying car 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.970
 designed so that one day 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.550
 provide efficient transportation in 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.160
 countries where the infrastructure is 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.879
 commercially limited is the automobile 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.790
 flying wanted to integrate the new 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.190
 modern communication technology as well 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.320
 as designer aspects so that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.739
 the object is attractive and does not look 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.870
 bizarre on the six-meter highways 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.510
 certainly longer than a car 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 average is designed to transport 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.879
 two people and can travel comfortably 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.050
 along the roads to 130 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.460
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.619
 Klassen points out that when it reaches 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.050
 airport the vehicle becomes 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.350
 plane with a quick tap of a 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.580
 switch 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.009
 this is the transformation when the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.390
 wings open in a few seconds this is 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.720
 the key moment when the inclination 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.149
 of the angle of the wing is changed part of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.050
 they lean forward simulating the rotation 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.050
 of the fuselage of the plane 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.800
 in this design studio in bratislava 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.230
 lines and his team work on improvements 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.650
 a new version of the flying car 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.050
 called airmobile 3 has planned its 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180
 production for next year giving a 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.160
 step closer towards the ultimate goal 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 of clint of course we do not expect the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.840
 aero mobile solve the problems of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.550
 global transportation but it would be very 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 interest to countries where 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.729
 Transportation infrastructure does not exist 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.220
 where two places 700 kilometers away 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.710
 distance are connected only by 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.080
 provisional roads there could 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 radically change the conditions of the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.650
 transport the engineer and designer 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.970
 54 year old amateur pilot himself 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.060
 started working in the car 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.430
 Flying in the early decade of 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.160
 1990 klain hopes that not many 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 more years for the project to be ready 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.660
 to be released commercially
