00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 two seconds to start this 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:11.460
 2013 season kicks off the grand prize of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.389

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 with hamilton come to braking care 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.430
 there are some passes some passes of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 braking and out back as always 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.480
 gone wrong better goes away we see 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 fernando almost matched first with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.900
 hamilton and we have to later 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 fernando that will go abroad 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.719
 It has inside louis hamilton going 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.969
 outside catching more where hamilton 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 is behind the two ferrari have passed 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 forward they have gained the position at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 name of mercedes suave and this camera 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.629
 subject of louis hamilton that goes from 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.760
 trying out three attractions 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.670
 fernando that goes for more 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 fernando very active very aggressive in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 these first meters has also won 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.750
 some a few meters some space 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.949
 sebastian vettel and let's see the rhythm 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 of the two ferrari that have to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 cut as much as possible does not interest that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 put away 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 remember that within three laps already 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.320
 we can use drs 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 there are two long as it should be 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.990
 stuck to the tail of felipe massa has 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 raikkonen right now at the point of 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690
 look at luisa that has come out very 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.210
 slow fernando goes by felipe goes by 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.000
 out what's going to get it has the brakes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.979
 the right curve we now see the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.080
 hoisting blocking king colin happens to him 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.670
 can outside fernando has happened to him in 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 and what it is behind Fernando yet 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.750
 watch the battle of raikkonen with 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.890
 louis hamilton 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 fernando trying to take off felipe 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 Massa who sees him going a little bit more 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 slow that has more rhythm right now he 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.219
 and from behind the battle of hamilton 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 raikkonen that will give them a little 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.640
 also of calm to the two ferrari that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.170
 they are fighting between them first step 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.420
 per finish line first 20 sides 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.609
 seconds more at 2,4 alonso hamilton 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.280
 raikkonen roster webber and subtracted with 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.920
 subtle jump sparks in the battle of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.719
 hamilton with kimi raikkonen at the moment 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 none can we have as it's coming 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.020
 also rosberg is standing behind 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.439
 from raikkonen goes very slow louis hamilton 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.659
 and little by little he's going to start doing 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 start doing little trains but with that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.959
 it's positive if we get it by giving them 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.459
 all because to see here there is clear 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.650
 Amyton is stopping everyone else 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.989
 but it is that felipe is also 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 Slow down I'm closing and as always 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.130
 It is worth saying but if you have 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.810
 'marisa' vettel of march two seconds 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.140
 away will no longer be able to attack him 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.660
 with drs we return the monkey to the circle 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.519
 last year vicious gale 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.959
 webber that came out the second position 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.360
 is now seventh confirming his 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.010
 bad bad usual outings if you have 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.660
 massa gone very wrong and has earned him the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.609
 position by him from the inside 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.780
 and it has been told a little closed and it is what 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.260
 which it has made him lose the whole thing 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.900
 in the two ferrari trying to chase 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.550
 to sebastian vettel but he has a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.230
 very comfortable advantage right now but 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.800
 I have never learned much from 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.510
 first sector 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.280
 they have to reduce that 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.310
 distance because soon it's going to 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.690
 being able to use the drs is essential to be 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.550
 less than a second cams that is going to be 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.480
 difficult to cut in half the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.710
 difference that right now it has 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.710
 sebastian vettel with respect to them 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.300
 we are on lap 2 still new 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.590
 step by goal line 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 massa is still in front and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.790
 raikkonen has already passed louis hamilton 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.500
 and let's see what we see because 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.900
 I also think it had more rhythm 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.880
 that the English driver quickly turn to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 felipe massa 1.8 the difference between 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.930
 vettel and massa 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.090
 alonso third with the fourth because 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.650
 when you can use the drs 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.519
 I guess Fernando is not going to have any 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.709
 problem to have it because it's not going to 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.090
 have the distance will not be able to open 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.360
 the drs and fernando may attack 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.360
 07 others
