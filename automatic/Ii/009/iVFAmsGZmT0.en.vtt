00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.200

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
going to make two pigtails and then I'm

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.740 
going to make two pigtails and then I'm
taking<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:48.280> medium<00:01:48.760> section<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.270> hair<00:01:49.479> just

taking a medium section of hair just
below<00:01:50.080> my<00:01:50.290> ear<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.220> at<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> nape<00:01:51.610> of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.780 
below my ear so this is at the nape of
my<00:01:51.790> neck<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.390> then<00:01:52.960> I'm<00:01:53.110> wrapping<00:01:53.560> my<00:01:53.979> hair<00:01:54.490> in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
my neck and then I'm wrapping my hair in

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.270 
my neck and then I'm wrapping my hair in
that<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.330> I'm<00:01:55.450> using<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.229> as<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> hair<00:01:57.070> tie

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
that so I'm using this as a hair tie

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.940 
that so I'm using this as a hair tie
rather<00:01:57.640> than<00:01:57.910> using<00:01:58.240> an<00:01:58.479> actual<00:01:58.720> elastic<00:01:59.410> this

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
rather than using an actual elastic this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.290 
rather than using an actual elastic this
hairstyle<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.550> going<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.759> be<00:02:00.880> messy<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
hairstyle is going to be messy and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.700 
hairstyle is going to be messy and
that's<00:02:01.570> why<00:02:01.750> we're<00:02:01.930> not<00:02:02.050> using<00:02:02.290> an<00:02:02.500> elastic

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
that's why we're not using an elastic

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.730 
that's why we're not using an elastic
because<00:02:03.190> an<00:02:03.550> elastic<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.149> look<00:02:04.360> too<00:02:04.810> like

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
because an elastic can look too like

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.190 
because an elastic can look too like
