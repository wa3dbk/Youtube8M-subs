and here we go so we're getting all the
pieces<00:00:04.830> laid<00:00:05.460> out<00:00:05.670> pre<00:00:06.210> curving<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.109> curved

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
pieces laid out pre curving the curved

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.860 
pieces laid out pre curving the curved
rails<00:00:07.820> making<00:00:08.820> sure<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> straight<00:00:09.480> ones<00:00:09.690> are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
rails making sure the straight ones are

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.230 
rails making sure the straight ones are
straight<00:00:12.290> I<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.769> already<00:00:13.980> used<00:00:14.429> this

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
straight I have already used this

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.220 
straight I have already used this
template<00:00:15.780> once<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.590> build<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.010> one<00:00:17.490> turn<00:00:17.699> out

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
template once to build it one turn out

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.880 
template once to build it one turn out
getting<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.820> frog<00:00:20.820> point<00:00:21.740> put<00:00:22.740> together

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
getting the frog point put together

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
getting the frog point put together
there<00:00:25.250> then<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> stick<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> ties

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
there then we're going to stick the ties

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.900 
there then we're going to stick the ties
down<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.289> yeah<00:00:29.599> get<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> new<00:00:30.840> template<00:00:31.759> and<00:00:32.759> lay

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
down but yeah get a new template and lay

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.380 
down but yeah get a new template and lay
down<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.120> new<00:00:34.100> double<00:00:35.100> sided<00:00:35.280> tape<00:00:35.399> put<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
down some new double sided tape put the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.889 
down some new double sided tape put the
ties<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.870> place<00:00:38.059> make<00:00:39.059> sure<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
ties in place make sure that you got the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
ties in place make sure that you got the
gaps<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> right<00:00:40.620> spot<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.579> bit

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
gaps in the right spot it's a little bit

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.920 
gaps in the right spot it's a little bit
of<00:00:41.790> flux<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> cat<00:00:44.930> here's

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of flux here and that was the cat here's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
of flux here and that was the cat here's
the<00:00:46.170> straight<00:00:46.500> rail<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> nice<00:00:47.610> straight

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the straight rail get a nice straight

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.590 
the straight rail get a nice straight
edge<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.510> sure<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.200> straight<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
edge make sure it's really straight and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
edge make sure it's really straight and
then<00:00:52.520> tack<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> Frog<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.980> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.550> right

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then tack the Frog down in the right

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
then tack the Frog down in the right
spot<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> gap<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> open<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
spot make sure the gap is open in that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
spot make sure the gap is open in that
narrow<00:00:59.940> part<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.870> bugger<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.800> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
narrow part because it's a bugger to get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
narrow part because it's a bugger to get
at<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> after<00:01:02.850> you've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.239> soldered<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
at it after you've got it soldered in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.500 
at it after you've got it soldered in
place<00:01:04.909> then<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.600> stock<00:01:07.049> rail<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
place then put the other stock rail in

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.600 
place then put the other stock rail in
make<00:01:09.510> sure<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.080> engage<00:01:10.880> with<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> Frog

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
make sure it's all engage with the Frog
