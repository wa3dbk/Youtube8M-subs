over to the shrine of Oryx which is a
mission<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> moon<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.550> set<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.880> heroic

them<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.760> over<00:00:38.879> again<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
them all over again and you do that in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
them all over again and you do that in
conjunction<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.160> black<00:00:41.399> wax<00:00:41.610> idols

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
conjunction with the black wax idols

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.250 
conjunction with the black wax idols
which<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.329> multiply<00:00:42.690> your<00:00:42.809> money<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
which would then multiply your money and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
which would then multiply your money and
in<00:00:43.530> terms<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> half<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.940> hour<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
in terms of in about a half an hour you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.819 
in terms of in about a half an hour you
could<00:00:45.600> generate<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> 10,000

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
could generate you know that 10,000

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
could generate you know that 10,000
given<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.670> good<00:00:47.730> now

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
given which was really really good now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.639 
given which was really really good now
that<00:00:48.660> no<00:00:48.840> longer<00:00:48.989> works<00:00:49.140> because

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that no longer works because

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
that no longer works because
unfortunately<00:00:49.800> bungee<00:00:50.460> patched<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.879> by

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
unfortunately bungee patched that by

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.540 
unfortunately bungee patched that by
removing<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.379> heroic<00:00:52.559> enemies<00:00:53.280> from

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
removing the kind of heroic enemies from

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
removing the kind of heroic enemies from
that<00:00:53.820> section<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> mission<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> AC<00:00:55.170> said

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that section in the mission the AC said

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
that section in the mission the AC said
they<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.770> too<00:00:56.039> difficult<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> time

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
they was too difficult at that time

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
they was too difficult at that time
which<00:00:57.149> basically<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.600> meant<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
which basically they're meant that the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.930 
which basically they're meant that the
enemies<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> yellow<00:00:59.430> life<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> ones

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
enemies of the yellow life are the ones

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
enemies of the yellow life are the ones
that<00:01:00.120> dropped<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> money<00:01:00.600> were<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.050> longer<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that dropped the money were no longer in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.959 
that dropped the money were no longer in
that<00:01:01.710> part<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> mission<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.699> therefore

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that part in the mission which therefore

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
that part in the mission which therefore
meant<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.840> no<00:01:03.960> longer<00:01:04.170> viable<00:01:04.290> because

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
meant it was no longer viable because

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.990 
meant it was no longer viable because
you<00:01:04.769> couldn't<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.430> bimmer<00:01:05.729> from

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you couldn't actually get bimmer from

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
you couldn't actually get bimmer from
killing<00:01:06.299> those<00:01:06.390> enemies<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.260> after<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
killing those enemies so after that I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.570 
killing those enemies so after that I
never<00:01:07.890> really<00:01:08.100> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> bothered<00:01:08.520> looking

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
never really kind of bothered looking

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.399 
never really kind of bothered looking
for<00:01:08.850> new<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.260> much<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
for new way because I'm pretty much a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
for new way because I'm pretty much a
selected<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.070> own<00:01:11.130> thing<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.580> found

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
selected my own thing you know found

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
selected my own thing you know found
money<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.299> own<00:01:12.360> way<00:01:12.570> went<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> vault

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
money my own way went through the vault

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
money my own way went through the vault
gloss<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> general<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
gloss and just in general kind of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
gloss and just in general kind of
accumulated<00:01:15.330> money<00:01:15.509> whenever<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.869> needed<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
accumulated money whenever I needed it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.120 
accumulated money whenever I needed it
so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.350> was<00:01:16.500> never<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> position

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so I was never really in a position

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
so I was never really in a position
where<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.520> needed<00:01:17.759> lots<00:01:17.909> lots<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> money<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
where I needed lots lots of money but I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.630 
where I needed lots lots of money but I
have<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> point<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.549> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
have now got to a point where I'm not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
have now got to a point where I'm not
bringing<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.970> lot<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.180> weapons<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
bringing a lot of weapons and for the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
bringing a lot of weapons and for the
first<00:01:22.140> time<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> long<00:01:22.680> time<00:01:22.860> today<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
first time in a long time today I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
first time in a long time today I
actually<00:01:23.850> ran<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> money<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.259> think

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
actually ran out of money so I think

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
actually ran out of money so I think
what<00:01:25.650> i<00:01:25.680> would<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> share<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> guys<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
what i would do is share with you guys a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
what i would do is share with you guys a
new<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.689> form<00:01:27.900> glimmer<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.590> one

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
new way you can form glimmer which one

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
new way you can form glimmer which one
admittedly<00:01:29.100> isn't<00:01:29.520> quite<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:29.939> lucrative<00:01:30.180> as

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
admittedly isn't quite as lucrative as

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
admittedly isn't quite as lucrative as
the<00:01:30.479> other<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.930> still<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.710> good<00:01:31.829> way

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the other one is still a really good way

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
the other one is still a really good way
to<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.130> Goomer<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.430> within<00:01:32.970> about<00:01:33.090> half<00:01:33.270> an

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to get Goomer and within about half an

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.060 
to get Goomer and within about half an
hour<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> an<00:01:34.170> hour<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.590> probably<00:01:34.829> get

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
hour to an hour you can probably get

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
hour to an hour you can probably get
about<00:01:35.159> ten<00:01:36.119> fifteen<00:01:36.270> thousand<00:01:36.720> village<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
about ten fifteen thousand village so

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
about ten fifteen thousand village so
it's<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.530> slower<00:01:37.770> than<00:01:37.920> before<00:01:38.070> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it's a little bit slower than before but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's a little bit slower than before but
it<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.610> still<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.240> fast<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it is still a really fast way to do it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
it is still a really fast way to do it
and<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.259> still<00:01:40.409> guarantee<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and it's still guarantee so what you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.370 
and it's still guarantee so what you
want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.509> first<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> go

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
want to do is first up you want to go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
want to do is first up you want to go
over<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> Mars<00:01:44.070> effectively<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> want

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
over to Mars effectively what you want

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
over to Mars effectively what you want
to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.509> doing<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> where<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to be doing is going over to where the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.130 
to be doing is going over to where the
Mars<00:01:47.159> strike<00:01:47.430> over<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> located<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
Mars strike over here is located and you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.569 
Mars strike over here is located and you
can<00:01:49.320> obviously<00:01:49.590> select<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> more<00:01:50.280> strike<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
can obviously select the more strike and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
can obviously select the more strike and
just<00:01:50.729> sort<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.750> typically

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just sort of go from there but typically

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.090 
just sort of go from there but typically
that<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.350> pair<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.770> two<00:01:52.950> other

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that will pair you up with two other

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.499 
that will pair you up with two other
people<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.640> therefore<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.329> just

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
people and therefore you would then just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.030 
people and therefore you would then just
be<00:01:54.600> leaving<00:01:54.720> them<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:54.990> lunch<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:55.950> like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
be leaving them at lunch so I don't like

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.200 
be leaving them at lunch so I don't like
to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:56.850> gonna<00:01:57.060> do

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
to do that so what I'm actually gonna do

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
to do that so what I'm actually gonna do
is<00:01:57.360> jump<00:01:57.540> over<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> patrol<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> drive<00:01:59.070> them

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
is jump over to it patrol and drive them

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.440 
is jump over to it patrol and drive them

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
see how to get there it is a pretty long

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.869 
see how to get there it is a pretty long
drive<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.280> gonna<00:02:08.399> sort<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> have

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to stay and watch this for like a minute

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
to stay and watch this for like a minute
or<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.619> I'm<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.310> pick<00:02:11.489> up<00:02:11.550> with<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
or so but I'm going to pick up with you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.040 
or so but I'm going to pick up with you
in<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> second<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.480> pay<00:02:12.569> attention<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
in a second so just pay attention to the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.380 
in a second so just pay attention to the
route

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
route

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.240 
route
going<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:14.110> once<00:02:14.260> were<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.530> will<00:02:14.830> go

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
going and then once were that will go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:03:25.420 
going and then once were that will go
through<00:02:15.460> how<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> actually<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> farming

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.429 

so<00:03:26.060> now<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.450> we're<00:03:26.540> actually<00:03:26.599> here<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.200> is

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
so now that we're actually here this is

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.599 
so now that we're actually here this is
the<00:03:27.500> area<00:03:27.980> you're<00:03:28.069> going<00:03:28.219> to<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.340> doing<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
the area you're going to be doing a

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.369 
the area you're going to be doing a
funny<00:03:28.819> now<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.359> way<00:03:29.569> this<00:03:29.689> effectively<00:03:30.109> works

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
funny now the way this effectively works

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.380 
funny now the way this effectively works
is<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.890> hinges<00:03:31.129> on<00:03:31.159> two<00:03:31.609> particular<00:03:31.760> enemies

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
is it hinges on two particular enemies

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.119 
is it hinges on two particular enemies
that<00:03:32.870> are<00:03:32.930> going<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.409> actually<00:03:33.560> respawn<00:03:34.099> a

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
that are going to actually respawn a

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.619 
that are going to actually respawn a
sort<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.489> again<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.790> again<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.239> those<00:03:35.420> get

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
sort of again and again and those get

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.059 
sort of again and again and those get
them<00:03:35.719> easier<00:03:35.930> on<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.049> kill<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.439> enemies<00:03:36.859> only

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
them easier on a kill the enemies only

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.679 
them easier on a kill the enemies only
just<00:03:37.310> kill<00:03:37.430> right<00:03:37.609> there<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:38.030> one<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.599> the

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
just kill right there that one of the

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.819 
just kill right there that one of the
yellow<00:03:38.840> life<00:03:38.989> while<00:03:39.200> they<00:03:39.349> are<00:03:39.469> the<00:03:39.530> ones<00:03:39.650> were

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
yellow life while they are the ones were

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
this cliff and you run straight forward

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
you go to that cave you slide under this

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.020 
you go to that cave you slide under this
rock<00:04:12.439> and<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.069> can<00:04:13.189> turn<00:04:13.370> straight<00:04:13.849> around

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
rock and you can turn straight around

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.280 
rock and you can turn straight around
and<00:04:14.389> that<00:04:14.480> will<00:04:14.629> perfect<00:04:14.959> when<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.109> trigger

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
and that will perfect when you trigger

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.080 
and that will perfect when you trigger
the<00:04:15.379> respawn<00:04:15.769> they<00:04:16.160> respawn<00:04:16.459> every<00:04:16.820> sort<00:04:17.000> but

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
the respawn they respawn every sort but

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.580 
the respawn they respawn every sort but
i<00:04:17.120> think<00:04:17.299> it's<00:04:17.419> like<00:04:17.479> seven<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.079> nine<00:04:18.229> seconds

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
i think it's like seven to nine seconds

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.539 
i think it's like seven to nine seconds
something<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:19.009> the<00:04:19.190> effectively

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
something like that the effectively

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.099 
something like that the effectively
slide<00:04:19.759> straight<00:04:20.000> under<00:04:20.209> here<00:04:20.389> turn<00:04:20.989> around

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
slide straight under here turn around

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.650 
slide straight under here turn around
and<00:04:21.769> when<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.130> come<00:04:22.280> back<00:04:22.460> those<00:04:23.389> enemies

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
and when you come back those enemies

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.640 
and when you come back those enemies
would<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.870> already<00:04:23.960> spawned<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:24.530> they'll

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
would have already spawned and they'll

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.930 
would have already spawned and they'll
start<00:04:24.860> running<00:04:25.070> towards<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.729> is<00:04:25.820> great

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
start running towards you this is great

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.159 
start running towards you this is great
because<00:04:26.090> they<00:04:26.240> come<00:04:26.389> directly<00:04:26.720> towards<00:04:26.840> you

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
because they come directly towards you

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.360 
because they come directly towards you
and<00:04:27.320> then<00:04:27.380> all<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:27.740> is<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.979> kill<00:04:28.190> both

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
and then all you do is you kill both

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.399 
and then all you do is you kill both
flows<00:04:28.639> you<00:04:29.389> then<00:04:29.539> go<00:04:29.570> back<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.020> cable<00:04:30.320> you

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
flows you then go back to the cable you

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.020 
flows you then go back to the cable you
were<00:04:30.470> just<00:04:30.620> at<00:04:30.770> slide<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> rock<00:04:31.699> turn

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
were just at slide on the rock turn

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.640 
were just at slide on the rock turn
around<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.330> come<00:04:32.510> back<00:04:32.570> now<00:04:33.320> what<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.500> want

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
to make sure you do to make this much

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.070 
to make sure you do to make this much

more effective in the same way that I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.210 
more effective in the same way that I
did<00:04:36.199> in<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.409> original<00:04:36.440> glimmer<00:04:36.949> following

so equipped one of those and then every
single<00:04:46.580> time<00:04:46.699> you<00:04:46.729> kill<00:04:46.970> those<00:04:47.090> two<00:04:47.270> guys<00:04:47.419> you

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
single time you kill those two guys you

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.659 
single time you kill those two guys you
should<00:04:47.720> be<00:04:47.900> getting<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.260> total<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.710> 74<00:04:49.370> glimmer

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
should be getting a total of 74 glimmer

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.550 
should be getting a total of 74 glimmer
I<00:04:49.940> appreciate<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.599> as<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.960> single<00:04:51.289> value

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
I appreciate that as a single value

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.140 
I appreciate that as a single value
doesn't<00:04:51.770> sound<00:04:52.099> that<00:04:52.190> great<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:52.729> do<00:04:52.909> bear<00:04:53.090> in

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
doesn't sound that great but do bear in

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.550 
doesn't sound that great but do bear in
mind<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:53.570> kill<00:04:53.750> these<00:04:53.900> two<00:04:53.930> enemies<00:04:54.380> in

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
mind that you kill these two enemies in

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.350 
mind that you kill these two enemies in
a<00:04:54.650> ridiculously<00:04:55.190> quick<00:04:55.430> period<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.759> time<00:04:55.909> you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
a ridiculously quick period of time you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.730 
a ridiculously quick period of time you
can<00:04:56.449> turn<00:04:56.659> around<00:04:56.720> dash<00:04:57.289> under<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.620> rock

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
can turn around dash under that rock

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.200 
can turn around dash under that rock
come<00:04:58.070> back<00:04:58.220> out<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.550> you're<00:04:58.909> killing<00:04:59.150> them

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
come back out and you're killing them

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.730 
come back out and you're killing them
again<00:04:59.449> so<00:04:59.840> within<00:05:00.020> about<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.259> minute<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.620> can

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
again so within about a minute you can

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.560 
again so within about a minute you can
probably<00:05:01.009> do<00:05:01.220> this<00:05:01.370> run<00:05:01.580> 3<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.210> 4<00:05:02.539> times

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
probably do this run 3 to 4 times

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.120 
probably do this run 3 to 4 times
depending<00:05:03.199> how<00:05:03.320> fast<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.710> kill<00:05:03.860> them<00:05:04.009> if

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
depending how fast you kill them if

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
depending how fast you kill them if
you're<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:04.460> efficient<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.000> way<00:05:05.030> you

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
you're really efficient in the way you

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.700 
you're really efficient in the way you
kill<00:05:05.360> them<00:05:05.479> then<00:05:05.960> yeah<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.169> can<00:05:06.320> probably<00:05:06.500> get

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
kill them then yeah you can probably get

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.960 
kill them then yeah you can probably get
about<00:05:06.800> four<00:05:07.070> runs<00:05:07.250> out<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.580> minute<00:05:07.729> which

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
about four runs out in a minute which

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.999 
about four runs out in a minute which
means<00:05:08.150> you're<00:05:08.270> making<00:05:08.479> around<00:05:08.659> you<00:05:08.870> know<00:05:09.009> 280

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
means you're making around you know 280

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.550 
means you're making around you know 280
300<00:05:10.729> per<00:05:10.849> minute<00:05:11.120> give<00:05:11.449> or<00:05:11.509> take<00:05:11.720> by<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.380> way

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
300 per minute give or take by the way

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.749 
300 per minute give or take by the way
what<00:05:12.740> now<00:05:12.889> going<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.099> do<00:05:13.159> is<00:05:13.370> just<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.580> quick

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
what now going to do is just a quick

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.279 
what now going to do is just a quick
sample<00:05:14.030> just<00:05:14.300> I'll<00:05:14.449> show<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.780> few<00:05:14.960> runs<00:05:15.169> on

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
sample just I'll show you a few runs on

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.390 
sample just I'll show you a few runs on
issues<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.710> can<00:05:15.770> kind<00:05:15.979> of<00:05:16.009> sort<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.220> see

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
issues so you can kind of sort of see

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.219 
issues so you can kind of sort of see
how<00:05:16.550> I'll<00:05:17.180> get<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.360> down<00:05:17.539> how<00:05:17.750> come<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.050> get<00:05:18.169> it

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
how I'll get it down how come and get it

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.450 
how I'll get it down how come and get it
into<00:05:18.349> sort<00:05:18.530> of<00:05:18.620> like<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.830> momentum<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
into sort of like a momentum and you

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.520 
into sort of like a momentum and you
actually<00:05:19.639> see<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.000> right<00:05:20.180> now<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.389> have<00:05:20.720> 734

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
actually see that right now I have 734

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.100 
actually see that right now I have 734
glimmer<00:05:22.280> yes<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.759> is<00:05:22.880> an<00:05:23.030> all-time<00:05:23.389> low<00:05:23.419> but

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
glimmer yes this is an all-time low but

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.480 
glimmer yes this is an all-time low but
spending<00:05:24.349> a<00:05:24.440> lot<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.620> crazy<00:05:24.860> upgrades<00:05:25.250> by<00:05:25.370> the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
spending a lot of crazy upgrades by the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.480 
spending a lot of crazy upgrades by the
way<00:05:25.610> yes<00:05:26.050> 734<00:05:27.050> glimmer<00:05:27.320> right<00:05:27.560> now<00:05:27.740> then<00:05:28.430> I'm

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
way yes 734 glimmer right now then I'm

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.350 
way yes 734 glimmer right now then I'm
going<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.669> run<00:05:28.759> through<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.970> couple<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.210> runs

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
going to run through a couple of runs

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.670 
going to run through a couple of runs
and<00:05:29.570> then<00:05:29.659> skip<00:05:29.900> forward<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.199> time<00:05:30.349> to<00:05:30.530> about

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
and then skip forward in time to about

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.839 
and then skip forward in time to about
10<00:05:30.830> minutes<00:05:30.979> later<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.460> can<00:05:31.550> actually<00:05:31.699> see

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
10 minutes later so you can actually see

00:05:31.849 --> 00:06:04.290 
10 minutes later so you can actually see
what<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.120> have<00:05:32.270> then

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.430 

so<00:06:05.300> now<00:06:05.450> if<00:06:05.540> you<00:06:05.630> look<00:06:05.780> you'll<00:06:05.960> see<00:06:06.110> that<00:06:06.230> going

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
so now if you look you'll see that going

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.760 
so now if you look you'll see that going
from<00:06:06.620> 750<00:06:07.400> for<00:06:07.550> gamers<00:06:07.850> who<00:06:08.200> 2288<00:06:09.200> limit<00:06:09.590> is<00:06:09.740> a

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
from 750 for gamers who 2288 limit is a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.240 
from 750 for gamers who 2288 limit is a
gain<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:11.110> 1534<00:06:12.110> glimmer<00:06:12.380> in<00:06:12.560> under<00:06:12.980> 10<00:06:13.220> minutes

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
gain of 1534 glimmer in under 10 minutes

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.430 
gain of 1534 glimmer in under 10 minutes
now<00:06:13.730> that<00:06:14.360> wasn't<00:06:14.570> actually<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.050> great<00:06:15.169> run

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
now that wasn't actually a great run

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.409 
now that wasn't actually a great run
because<00:06:15.740> during<00:06:16.040> that<00:06:16.280> run<00:06:16.430> I<00:06:16.669> had<00:06:17.090> a<00:06:17.120> public

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
because during that run I had a public

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.940 
because during that run I had a public
event<00:06:17.480> drop<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.230> decided<00:06:18.560> not<00:06:18.740> to<00:06:18.830> ignore

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
event drop and I decided not to ignore

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.530 
event drop and I decided not to ignore
it<00:06:19.160> i<00:06:19.220> decided<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.639> go<00:06:19.669> after<00:06:19.850> its<00:06:20.090> own<00:06:20.270> actual

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
it i decided to go after its own actual

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.730 
it i decided to go after its own actual
fact<00:06:20.690> i've<00:06:20.810> wasted<00:06:20.960> without<00:06:21.139> two<00:06:21.410> minutes<00:06:21.680> of

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
fact i've wasted without two minutes of

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.500 
fact i've wasted without two minutes of
time<00:06:21.919> so<00:06:22.250> I<00:06:22.280> then<00:06:22.460> run<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.639> second<00:06:23.000> test<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.419> I

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
time so I then run a second test and I

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.590 
time so I then run a second test and I
put<00:06:23.690> on<00:06:23.780> another<00:06:24.080> resupply<00:06:24.590> phone<00:06:24.830> went<00:06:25.370> from

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
put on another resupply phone went from

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.420 
put on another resupply phone went from
2288<00:06:26.600> limit<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.110> used<00:06:27.530> eight<00:06:27.740> minutes<00:06:28.130> of<00:06:28.280> the

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
2288 limit and used eight minutes of the

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.950 
2288 limit and used eight minutes of the
ten<00:06:28.580> minutes<00:06:28.820> in<00:06:28.940> that<00:06:29.000> item<00:06:29.389> and<00:06:29.570> eight

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
ten minutes in that item and eight

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.590 
ten minutes in that item and eight
minutes<00:06:30.260> later<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:30.530> ended<00:06:30.680> up<00:06:30.979> with<00:06:31.600> 4006

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
minutes later I ended up with 4006

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.920 
minutes later I ended up with 4006
glimmer<00:06:32.870> which<00:06:33.200> is<00:06:33.350> a<00:06:33.380> gain<00:06:33.620> of<00:06:34.630> 1718<00:06:35.630> glimmer

glimmer which is a gain of 1718 glimmer
in<00:06:36.110> eight<00:06:36.710> minutes<00:06:37.070> which<00:06:37.700> averages<00:06:38.090> out<00:06:38.210> at

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
in eight minutes which averages out at

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.200 
in eight minutes which averages out at
214<00:06:39.290> glimmer<00:06:39.560> per<00:06:39.950> minute<00:06:40.250> so<00:06:40.790> times<00:06:41.000> out<00:06:41.120> by

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
214 glimmer per minute so times out by

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.610 
214 glimmer per minute so times out by
10<00:06:41.419> and<00:06:41.630> you'll<00:06:41.780> see<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:41.990> in<00:06:42.110> 10<00:06:42.260> minutes<00:06:42.440> I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
10 and you'll see the in 10 minutes I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.550 
10 and you'll see the in 10 minutes I
could<00:06:42.650> get<00:06:43.419> 2147<00:06:44.419> glimmer<00:06:44.780> multiply<00:06:45.440> that

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
could get 2147 glimmer multiply that

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.719 
could get 2147 glimmer multiply that
into<00:06:45.770> an<00:06:45.860> hour<00:06:45.979> and<00:06:46.250> you'll<00:06:46.340> see<00:06:46.460> that<00:06:46.490> in<00:06:46.639> an

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
into an hour and you'll see that in an

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.780 
into an hour and you'll see that in an
hour<00:06:46.820> I<00:06:47.090> could<00:06:47.300> earn<00:06:47.419> 12,000<00:06:48.190> 885<00:06:49.190> glimmer<00:06:49.550> and

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
hour I could earn 12,000 885 glimmer and

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.219 
hour I could earn 12,000 885 glimmer and
then<00:06:50.120> push<00:06:50.270> that<00:06:50.300> forward<00:06:50.419> again<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:50.840> in<00:06:51.080> two

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
then push that forward again and in two

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.810 
then push that forward again and in two
hours<00:06:51.440> time<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.830> will<00:06:51.950> be<00:06:52.040> at<00:06:52.220> the<00:06:52.370> glimmer<00:06:52.610> cap

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
hours time I will be at the glimmer cap

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.480 
hours time I will be at the glimmer cap
of<00:06:53.229> 25,000<00:06:54.229> so<00:06:54.680> as<00:06:54.800> you<00:06:54.860> can<00:06:54.979> see<00:06:55.100> it's<00:06:55.370> pretty

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
of 25,000 so as you can see it's pretty

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.280 
of 25,000 so as you can see it's pretty
fast<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:56.120> still<00:06:56.450> isn't<00:06:56.570> quite<00:06:56.780> as<00:06:56.870> far<00:06:57.020> as<00:06:57.200> the

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
fast it still isn't quite as far as the

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.629 
fast it still isn't quite as far as the
original<00:06:57.530> method<00:06:57.680> by<00:06:58.010> hey<00:06:58.130> it's<00:06:58.310> been<00:06:58.430> patched

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
original method by hey it's been patched

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.890 
original method by hey it's been patched
there's<00:06:58.910> nothing<00:06:59.120> we<00:06:59.180> can<00:06:59.300> do<00:06:59.389> about<00:06:59.479> that<00:06:59.600> so

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
there's nothing we can do about that so

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.600 
there's nothing we can do about that so
this<00:07:00.080> for<00:07:00.440> the<00:07:00.530> time<00:07:00.680> being<00:07:00.889> is<00:07:01.070> the<00:07:01.250> next<00:07:01.490> best

this for the time being is the next best

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.430 
this for the time being is the next best
thing<00:07:01.880> hopefully<00:07:02.600> find<00:07:02.780> is<00:07:02.840> helpful<00:07:03.169> and<00:07:03.350> as
