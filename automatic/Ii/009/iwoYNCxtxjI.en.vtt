00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.100
 Um, I'm going to send it to you guys. 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.920
 to see that it has some 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.650
 some peculiarities that time does not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.830
 Is time year is always one is the same 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 way the scenario but what if it changes is 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 very cool and I was told I thought a lot 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.820

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 downloading outside the internet is all via 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.860

 come on 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.570
 will not fit on almost the entire screen 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.580
 because my camcorder she is better 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.140
 that at this angle here in the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.170
 horizontally or vertically 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 Let's go there cool 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 otherwise you can not get the accelerometers 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.130
 on the scoreboard 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.090

 a little bit more and I played 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.739
 I found the lighting movement of the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.519
