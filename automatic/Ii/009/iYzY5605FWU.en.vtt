00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
bolts I would highly recommend getting

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.590 
bolts I would highly recommend getting
underneath<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.590> shooting<00:03:20.590> them<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.980> some

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
so that you have a chance getting them

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.550 
so that you have a chance getting them
out<00:03:35.310> where<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.459> one<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.670> awful<00:03:37.269> Christian

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.120 

this<00:04:14.670> one<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.180> heart<00:04:15.720> these<00:04:16.470> bolts<00:04:16.799> seem

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
this one is the heart these bolts seem

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.830 
this one is the heart these bolts seem
to<00:04:17.370> break<00:04:18.359> loose

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
to break loose

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.690 
to break loose
and<00:04:19.590> make<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.799> harder<00:04:20.220> before<00:04:20.340> they<00:04:20.579> get

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
and make it harder before they get

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.890 
and make it harder before they get
easier<00:04:20.850> again<00:04:24.200> how<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:25.230> plugged<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:26.900> one

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
easier again how that plugged it one

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.920 
easier again how that plugged it one
bolt<00:04:28.170> in<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:29.360> don't<00:04:30.360> think<00:04:30.420> there's<00:04:30.690> much

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
bolt in it I don't think there's much

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.820 
bolt in it I don't think there's much
left<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:34.850> burn<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.030> somewhere<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:37.560> get<00:04:37.800> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
left to burn it somewhere just get a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.680 
left to burn it somewhere just get a
little<00:04:38.250> burn<00:04:38.640> it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.040 

yeah<00:04:43.640> so<00:04:44.640> now<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.910> suppose<00:04:45.390> it's<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> good<00:04:45.750> time

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
yeah so now I suppose it's a good time

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.150 
yeah so now I suppose it's a good time
to<00:04:46.200> clean<00:04:46.350> all<00:04:46.560> this<00:04:46.710> up

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
to clean all this up

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.430 
to clean all this up
so<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:48.200> will<00:04:49.200> find<00:04:49.410> my<00:04:49.620> shop<00:04:50.190> back
