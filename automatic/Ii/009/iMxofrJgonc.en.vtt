00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 to specialist gaming press 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.470
 that beacon of light in the darkness of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.179
 know about brave gamers and 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 journalists workers that if not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 impossible to bring the best reviews 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.140
 in categorical value judgments more 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.949
 objectives and apart and but but but that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.720
 it is this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.720
 pepe but what is this 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.930
 does not make much of a movie very 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.330
 interesting called the dictatorship 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.460
 perfect is a film he can luis 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.830
 estrada that deals with how the government 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.960
 and the press get involved to deliver 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.030
 false news and smoke screens for 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 manipulate in a certain way their 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 spectators is a movie that you 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.410
 full of impotence due to reality 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.090
 social that is lived in mexico but good 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.550
 those that are not from mexico maybe this 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.070
 they are not interested in the point is that outside 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.440
 from the anger of my country I came up with a 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.210
 question was the same in this way with 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.940
 the video games maybe the analogy 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.369
 from the beginning that is valid and not 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.950
 have comparison but what if yes 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.090
 come on I know that video games form 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.460
 part of the industry of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 entertainment not like newscast that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.530
 talk about we will have witnessed 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.020
 many things that may be 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.330
 contradiction of terms if we 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.990
 we peek into certain press pages of 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.450
 video game 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
 we'll see how there are commercials and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 advertising of certain games company 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.369
 feel gers I say I know you have to eat and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.840
 If you do not like audiences, you can 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.659
 getting the name in trouble 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.689
 of your site and somehow or other I 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.149
 I have also lived this but as we know 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.460
 if you have to deliver those copies for 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.819
 reviews before they are published to the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.939
 sale and that money for the commercial 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:53.119
 they do not fall badly now this will not be able to influence 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.909
 in the judgment of the critics I return the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.100
 movie mentioned above the program 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.069
 it was because the press and the union government 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.740
 forces to deliver content that does not 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.319
 alarm people already know about the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.440
 social reality will not happen that the 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.959
 companies join forces with the press 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.970
 you know this nice hub and I do not want 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.970
 go very pessimistic although it is already 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.980
 too late but there are chances full 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.980
 of things that make a good with the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.920
 stomach and one loses hope by 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.200
 this world but the good part of all 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.260
 this tragicomedy is that as in the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 day-to-day news also in the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.579
 videogames there are people was throws that are 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.120
 independent and who do this for love 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.400
 to art until you get doritos and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.769
 but that's the beauty of being our 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.080
 criterion much of what I have 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.480
 learned about the industry is with the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.400
 specialized press there are already several 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 tools that we have on hand for 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.890
 investigate for ourselves about what 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 is happening with video games and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
 those brave knights who 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.190
 They reveal for giving us more information 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.680
 relevant on the industry as 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.950
 we must be wise and grasp what we 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.599
 serve and what is not in the trash is a 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.030
 fact that the big houses 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.420
 publishers studies include certain 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.910
 way and in some places but good to 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.920
 we need to know where we are from 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 we inform to know more and more 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.569
 about the newest and what is not so 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.569
 new of this beautiful taste that unites us 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.340
 but but it is net of mushrooms that is that 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.340
 this does not make sense 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 again
