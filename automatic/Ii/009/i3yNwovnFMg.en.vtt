 it was created by light and now if 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.239
 let's start pay attention first 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.250
 they go to the link that I leave in the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.550
 description and will take them to a page 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.879
 60 space in which they should press this 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.190
 button to download the acc and 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.770
 downloaded they will have a folder 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.530
 winrar which they will have to extract and 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.140
 will be two files the first is the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 Here is a second notebook is 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.320
 important that they read it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.170
 good already extracted opens in the transformes 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 what is the transformed unloaded and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.829
 wait for them to load already loaded 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 they open the acc they give it to ok they wait for 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.720
 that the acc they open completely and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 now they enter your account and go to a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 board camp alone they choose it in this part 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.170
 well as I put bootcamp followed by 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.110
 many random letters already being in the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 room pay close attention to this step 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.319
 since it is the most important already being 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 in the bootcamp press the first 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.939
 box from which they must wait for 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.429
 is marked and then press the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.439
 key here and then press the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.899
 second box from which those steps the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.720
 they must perform very very quickly since 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.340
 if they do not do it fast they will leave the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.159
 server connection has been 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.670
 interrupted so what should they do 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.979
 very fast good has done that should 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.560
