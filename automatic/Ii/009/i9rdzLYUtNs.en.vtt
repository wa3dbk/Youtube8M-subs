other one and we're gonna breed them

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.419 
other one and we're gonna breed them
together<00:01:59.799> alright<00:02:00.799> there<00:02:01.039> we<00:02:01.069> go<00:02:01.250> the

together alright there we go the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.699 
together alright there we go the
snowflake<00:02:01.970> versus<00:02:02.450> snowflake<00:02:03.080> or<00:02:03.289> with<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
snowflake versus snowflake or with the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.449 
snowflake versus snowflake or with the
snowflake<00:02:04.220> ruther<00:02:05.049> three<00:02:06.049> hours<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:07.100> don't

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
snowflake ruther three hours I don't

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.870 
snowflake ruther three hours I don't
think<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.789> gonna<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.360> one<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.660> want

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
alright we this one we already have

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.229 
alright we this one we already have
let's<00:02:12.530> try<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.739> breathe<00:02:12.980> again<00:02:13.190> let's<00:02:14.090> see

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
let's try to breathe again let's see

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.750 
let's try to breathe again let's see
what<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.480> get<00:02:17.140> twenty<00:02:18.140> five<00:02:18.170> hours<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.040> zero

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
what we get twenty five hours so zero

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.100 
what we get twenty five hours so zero
one<00:02:19.849> zero<00:02:20.330> zero<00:02:20.890> 59<00:02:21.890> 59<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.780> breeding

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
one zero zero 59 59 so that's a breeding

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.160 
one zero zero 59 59 so that's a breeding

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
dragging the spike gear one so that's

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.979 
dragging the spike gear one so that's
the<00:03:07.400> first<00:03:07.639> animation<00:03:08.030> kind<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.510> jumps<00:03:08.870> and

the first animation kind of jumps and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.650 
the first animation kind of jumps and
just<00:03:09.230> turns<00:03:09.410> around<00:03:09.970> second<00:03:10.970> form<00:03:11.269> as<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.480> can

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
just turns around second form as you can

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.590 
just turns around second form as you can
see<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:12.109> more<00:03:12.139> spiky<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.910> icicles<00:03:14.690> there

as<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.000> can<00:04:14.150> see<00:04:14.270> it<00:04:14.360> looks<00:04:14.510> really<00:04:15.280> similar

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
as you can see it looks really similar

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.030 
as you can see it looks really similar
to<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.700> second<00:04:17.420> one<00:04:17.630> except<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.560> also

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
to the second one except it also

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.849 
to the second one except it also
combines<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.850> first<00:04:20.120> one<00:04:20.390> as<00:04:20.570> well<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:21.680> it

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
combines the first one as well there it

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.480 
combines the first one as well there it
is<00:04:23.110> I'm<00:04:24.110> assuming<00:04:24.620> they<00:04:24.740> will<00:04:24.920> have<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.250> same

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
is I'm assuming they will have the same

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.360 
is I'm assuming they will have the same
breath<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.210> same<00:04:26.420> dragon<00:04:27.020> breath<00:04:27.370> you'll

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
breath the same dragon breath you'll

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.090 
breath the same dragon breath you'll
notice<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.350> one<00:04:30.530> we're<00:04:30.680> looking<00:04:30.710> at

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
notice that the the one we're looking at

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.330 
notice that the the one we're looking at
the<00:04:31.220> fourth<00:04:31.520> one<00:04:31.820> has<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:33.170> darker<00:04:33.800> shade<00:04:34.070> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
the fourth one has a darker shade of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.490 
the fourth one has a darker shade of
blue<00:04:34.670> which<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.360> guess<00:04:35.630> it's<00:04:35.930> due<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.470> a

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
blue which I guess it's due to a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.380 
blue which I guess it's due to a
combination<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.400> first<00:04:37.580> one<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.940> second

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
combination of the first one the second

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.040 
combination of the first one the second
one<00:04:38.420> but<00:04:39.290> there<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.730> snowflake<00:04:41.630> dragon

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
one but there it is the snowflake dragon

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.590 
one but there it is the snowflake dragon
the<00:04:42.140> fourth<00:04:42.500> snowflake<00:04:43.280> dragon<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:44.000> dragon

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
the fourth snowflake dragon in dragon

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.900 
the fourth snowflake dragon in dragon
vale<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.230> how<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.530> breathe<00:04:45.920> breathe<00:04:46.760> it
