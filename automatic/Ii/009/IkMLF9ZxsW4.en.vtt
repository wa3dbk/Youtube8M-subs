00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.550
This tutorial describes the function called
"Find in this Sequence"

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.579
which appears on records in the Entrez Nucleotide
and Protein databases,

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.919
in the "Analyze this sequence" section of the
page.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.029
Your first question might be, how is this better
than my browser's Find function?

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.329
First of all, it takes patterns as input, like the Prosite pattern syntax

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.539
and IUPAC ambiguity codes for nucleotides.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.990
And second, it ignores white space and breaks
between lines,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.310
essentially wrapping around the displayed
sequence.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.010
Here are a few examples,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.590
starting with a Prosite pattern.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.170
Let's say you found this record for putative zinc finger protein containing twenty three

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.310
zinc fingers

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.860
and you'd like to see their distribution.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.530
Click the link "Find in this Sequence"

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.010
and notice the input box near the bottom of the page.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.010
I'll paste in the Prosite pattern for C2H2-type zinc fingers

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.710
and click Find.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.330
The first match is highlighted in a different
color than the subsequent matches,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.860
which you can scroll through with the controls.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.770
The total number of matches, as well as the
coordinates for the selected, reddish, pattern

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.370
are also displayed.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.210
You can also search multiple records when they are
displayed in the same page.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.860
In the final example, I'll locate the polyA signal

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.150
in human and dog mRNA's for the CSK gene.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.150
I'll first display the FASTA format for these
records,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.720
then search for the pattern.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.549
I'm sure you can imagine other uses for this
Find function.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:15.049
Why not share your ideas on NCBI's facebook page,

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:15.709
or on Twitter.
