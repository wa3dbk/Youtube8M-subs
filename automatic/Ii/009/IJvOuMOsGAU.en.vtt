00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.030
 Yes Hello ahead is 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.530
 8 Name New Year 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 The effect of the 3rd date today January 3rd 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.580
 I will work again from the same 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.580
 Begins 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.720
 It was a while 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.470
 Well to a variety Hey horse included Kaka 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:42.320
 This also this it has taken this flaxen 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:46.910
 This video is this time I'd such is 1 dr movie of Sony to Protege 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.500
 Though it is Nema video of Roppongi Hills well though 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 again 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.520
 Yeah this is great 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 Beneath I think Naa's camera the fire 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.070
 that 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.140
 After all 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.159
 To take in and Well many Toko Toka or a Well equivalent Toka or be in in this kind of room 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.720
 If you don't 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.500
 After all, I guess that their potential 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.500
 I do not know 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:22.000
 It may be a wide-angle lens, but it may be easy to take. 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.230
 Even for life 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.230
 It will be a cool picture 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.159
 I really felt this 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.549
 That really 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:38.229
 For example, the angle of view 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:43.200
 Without beg properly positive against even Tsu diagonal some 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.360
 So that's why it will come before 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.120
 Well, this lens is unique 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.990
 Oh dear 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.490
 It does say Ette 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:01.329
 I felt it really this time hm 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.329
 I think it is a video camera with great potential 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.780
 This is also recommended if we were buying people who are depending on it whether or not to buy it that if 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.980
 Well this guy is really this mic 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.550
 Norihiro Chihiro of the sound, either good or bad 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.599
 In addition to in your windshield deed only name I If you do not firmly 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.599
 Wind noise 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.580
 In so we pick up the other which is also considered 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.240
 I think that I would like you to be careful 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.260
 Well originally this is to take a sound sleep and the other music 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.000
 Is being developed with the purpose of 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.850
 I'm kind of outright shooting ridges but my fingers are not the main subject 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.390
 I think it was ok to run before I said it was taken 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.420
 I have to go to bed properly but I can take a very beautiful picture 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.420
 That price is really good 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 Especially that sound 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 Ne 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.350
 If you set it up this way, you 'll get in roughly 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.350
 Even if you do not look at the screen 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.210
 And from kan 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.210
 So try using 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.599
 I see it's kind of feeling 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.340
 I think it is a great camera 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.340
 Well that's it, but 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.380
 After the New Year 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.850
 I didn't do any shopping this year 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.630
 It's like that 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.630
 There was no sense at all about that first sale and such 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.220
 Mont bar of the Apple Store 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.670
 The lucky bag 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.670
 Let's go or Na Nante I'd thought at the time of the end of the year 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.580
 Isn't it a great time to ask? 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.920
 Though it is 30,000 yen, it seems to be 30,000 students 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:19.720
 But it is not to go to be lined up it longer than ten hours 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.720

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.430
