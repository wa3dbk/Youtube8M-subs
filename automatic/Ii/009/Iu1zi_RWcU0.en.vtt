why can't it charge another phone or

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.639 
why can't it charge another phone or
tablet<00:01:20.550> after<00:01:20.850> all<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.390> outputs<00:01:21.899> a<00:01:22.080> minimum<00:01:22.500> of

tablet after all it outputs a minimum of

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.230 
tablet after all it outputs a minimum of
500<00:01:22.890> million<00:01:23.310> hour<00:01:23.490> power<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.149> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
500 million hour power which is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.109 
500 million hour power which is
sufficient<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> charge<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.259> phone<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.649> tablet

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.029 
device that you want to charge as simple
as<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.170> let<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.530> ahead<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.860> put

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
as that so let me go ahead and put

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.889 
as that so let me go ahead and put
everything<00:01:44.220> together<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> end<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
everything together so this end is

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.260 
everything together so this end is
connected<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> usb<00:01:49.950> OTG<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.789> is<00:01:51.060> in

connected to the usb OTG which is in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.210 
connected to the usb OTG which is in
turn<00:01:51.509> connected<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.229> device<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.860> will

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
turn connected to the device that will

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.070 
turn connected to the device that will
provide<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.700> charge<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.509> said<00:01:54.659> over<00:01:54.780> here

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
provide the charge as I said over here

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.809 
provide the charge as I said over here
we'll<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.679> into<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.039> device<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
we'll be going into the device that you

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.070 
we'll be going into the device that you
want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> charge<00:01:57.539> just<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.599> how<00:02:00.599> it

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
want to charge just like that and how it

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.169 
want to charge just like that and how it
does<00:02:01.410> works<00:02:01.739> let<00:02:02.220> me<00:02:02.369> zoom<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.789> little<00:02:02.910> bit

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
does works let me zoom in a little bit

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.600 
does works let me zoom in a little bit
and<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.959> you<00:02:04.050> can<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.349> there<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> lightning

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and as you can see there is a lightning

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.609 
and as you can see there is a lightning
charging<00:02:06.090> icon<00:02:06.270> beside<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.899> battery<00:02:07.440> bar

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
charging icon beside the battery bar

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
charging icon beside the battery bar
which<00:02:08.160> means<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> device<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.970> charging<00:02:09.000> at

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
which means the device is charging at

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.479 
which means the device is charging at
this<00:02:09.630> moment<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.530> let's<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.890> ahead<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.310> test

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
this moment but let's go ahead and test

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.800 
this moment but let's go ahead and test
the<00:02:11.640> same<00:02:11.819> thing<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> device<00:02:12.569> which

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the same thing with the device which

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.020 
the same thing with the device which
does<00:02:12.840> not<00:02:13.170> supports<00:02:13.680> an<00:02:13.800> USB<00:02:14.040> OTG<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.879> can

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
does not supports an USB OTG as you can

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.089 
does not supports an USB OTG as you can
see<00:02:15.180> my<00:02:15.360> Micromax<00:02:15.840> device<00:02:16.290> does<00:02:16.530> not<00:02:16.709> support

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
see my Micromax device does not support

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.580 
see my Micromax device does not support
an<00:02:17.310> USB<00:02:17.550> OTG<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.569> let's<00:02:18.720> hook<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> same<00:02:19.319> thing

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
an USB OTG so let's hook the same thing

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.900 
an USB OTG so let's hook the same thing
up<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.160> device<00:02:20.430> over<00:02:20.610> here

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
up with this device over here

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.900 
up with this device over here
and<00:02:21.090> boom<00:02:22.080> bang<00:02:22.379> ping<00:02:22.739> even<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.700> works

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and boom bang ping even this one works

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.059 
and boom bang ping even this one works
so<00:02:24.599> your<00:02:24.750> device<00:02:24.989> should<00:02:25.379> at<00:02:25.560> least<00:02:25.739> recognize

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
so your device should at least recognize

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.970 
so your device should at least recognize
the<00:02:26.670> USB<00:02:27.150> OTG<00:02:27.270> connection<00:02:28.230> even<00:02:28.440> though<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the USB OTG connection even though the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
the USB OTG connection even though the
USB<00:02:29.280> OTG<00:02:29.340> works<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:29.970> not<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.810> will

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
USB OTG works or not and this will

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.080 
USB OTG works or not and this will
probably<00:02:31.379> work<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.489> your<00:02:32.670> device<00:02:32.760> does

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
probably work but if your device does

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.140 
probably work but if your device does
not<00:02:33.120> recognize<00:02:33.660> USB<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.530> may<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.310> work<00:02:35.640> but

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
not recognize USB this may not work but

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.119 
not recognize USB this may not work but
I<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.300> tested<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.230> most<00:02:37.620> devices<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
I have tested it out all most devices it

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.800 
I have tested it out all most devices it
did<00:02:38.310> work<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.760> best<00:02:38.910> part<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.300> both<00:02:39.629> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
did work but the best part is both of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
did work but the best part is both of
these<00:02:39.900> devices<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.560> be<00:02:40.620> actively<00:02:41.129> used<00:02:41.489> when

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
these devices can be actively used when

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.550 
these devices can be actively used when
the<00:02:42.000> charge<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.300> being<00:02:42.599> transferred<00:02:43.019> which<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the charge is being transferred which is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.229 
the charge is being transferred which is
a<00:02:43.590> great<00:02:43.800> thing<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:44.700> before<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> end<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
a great thing now before I end this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.400 
a great thing now before I end this
video<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.840> me<00:02:45.959> give<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> some

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
video and then me give you some

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.080 
video and then me give you some
background<00:02:46.440> information<00:02:47.030> charging<00:02:48.030> your

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
background information charging your

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
background information charging your
device<00:02:48.360> why<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.629> method<00:02:48.959> will<00:02:49.290> provide<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
device why this method will provide a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.640 
device why this method will provide a

constant 5 volts at zero point 5 ampere
hour<00:02:52.890> rate<00:02:53.220> which<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.910> pretty<00:02:54.060> standard<00:02:54.360> for

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
hour rate which is pretty standard for

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.570 
hour rate which is pretty standard for
most<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> Android<00:02:55.440> devices<00:02:55.709> but<00:02:56.040> if<00:02:56.519> you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
most of the Android devices but if you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.400 
most of the Android devices but if you
have<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> bigger<00:02:57.120> device<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.690> you're<00:02:57.900> using<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
have a bigger device and you're using it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.350 
have a bigger device and you're using it
while<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.830> charging<00:02:58.890> by<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.400> method<00:02:59.760> then

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
while it's charging by this method then

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000 
while it's charging by this method then
it<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.540> definitely<00:03:00.660> charge<00:03:01.230> slower<00:03:01.590> than<00:03:01.890> it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
it will definitely charge slower than it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.530 
it will definitely charge slower than it
would<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.670> connected<00:03:02.999> to<00:03:03.030> an<00:03:03.209> actual

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
would if it is connected to an actual

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.069 
would if it is connected to an actual
charger

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
charger

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.140 
charger
however<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.980> charging<00:03:05.370> speeds<00:03:05.790> would<00:03:06.030> be

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
however the charging speeds would be

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.690 
however the charging speeds would be
same

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
same

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.460 
same
as<00:03:06.760> charging<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.360> from<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.599> computer<00:03:08.080> since

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
as charging it from a computer since

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.460 
as charging it from a computer since
computer<00:03:08.920> USB<00:03:09.220> ports<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.700> USB<00:03:09.940> OTG<00:03:10.260> both<00:03:11.260> are

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
computer USB ports and USB OTG both are

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.009 
computer USB ports and USB OTG both are
2.0<00:03:12.040> ports<00:03:12.400> which<00:03:12.550> means<00:03:12.760> same<00:03:12.970> voltage<00:03:13.209> same

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
2.0 ports which means same voltage same

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.410 
2.0 ports which means same voltage same
ampere<00:03:14.379> rates<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.040> yep<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.400> do<00:03:15.519> hope<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.269> you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
ampere rates so yep I do hope that you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.699 
ampere rates so yep I do hope that you
got<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.720> learn<00:03:16.870> something<00:03:17.110> new<00:03:17.260> from<00:03:17.410> this
