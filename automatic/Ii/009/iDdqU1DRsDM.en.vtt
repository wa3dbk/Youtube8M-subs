this video is log placement by log

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.689 
this video is log placement by log
placement<00:00:28.329> what<00:00:28.749> I<00:00:28.779> mean<00:00:29.109> is<00:00:29.409> that<00:00:29.739> I<00:00:29.980> feel<00:00:30.429> the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
placement what I mean is that I feel the

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.550 
placement what I mean is that I feel the
best<00:00:30.849> distance<00:00:31.329> apart<00:00:31.659> for<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.259> burning

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
best distance apart for the burning

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.740 
best distance apart for the burning
phases<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.280> two<00:00:33.520> logs<00:00:33.760> in<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.030> fireplace<00:00:34.060> is

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
phases of two logs in the fireplace is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.720 
phases of two logs in the fireplace is
roughly<00:00:35.649> between<00:00:36.070> five<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.370> seven

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
roughly between five and seven

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.849 
roughly between five and seven
centimeters<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.780> these<00:00:41.050> two<00:00:41.440> logs<00:00:41.620> are

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
centimeters if these two logs are

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.060 
centimeters if these two logs are
burning<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:43.390> flat<00:00:43.809> faces<00:00:44.230> of<00:00:44.320> them<00:00:44.440> are

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
burning and the flat faces of them are

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.650 
burning and the flat faces of them are
about<00:00:45.370> five<00:00:45.579> to<00:00:45.699> seven<00:00:45.850> centimeters<00:00:46.149> apart

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
about five to seven centimeters apart

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.580 
about five to seven centimeters apart
that<00:00:46.899> achieves<00:00:47.199> two<00:00:47.440> things<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:50.199> distance

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
that achieves two things the distance

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.619 
that achieves two things the distance
apart<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:50.980> far<00:00:51.250> enough<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:51.789> oxygen<00:00:52.059> can

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
apart is far enough so that oxygen can

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.569 
apart is far enough so that oxygen can
get<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:52.929> between<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.530> logs<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.949> feed<00:00:54.429> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
get in between the logs and feed the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.209 
get in between the logs and feed the
fire<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:56.260> they<00:00:56.469> are<00:00:56.559> close<00:00:56.769> enough<00:00:57.039> together

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
fire but they are close enough together

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.040 
fire but they are close enough together
so<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.789> each<00:00:57.910> log<00:00:58.239> can<00:00:58.449> keep<00:00:58.660> burning

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
so that each log can keep burning

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.990 
so that each log can keep burning
partially<00:00:59.649> because<00:00:59.859> it's<00:01:00.190> feeding<00:01:00.489> off<00:01:00.820> the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
partially because it's feeding off the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.869 
partially because it's feeding off the
heat<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.019> other<00:01:02.170> burning<00:01:02.559> log<00:01:02.739> if<00:01:03.730> you

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
heat of the other burning log if you

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.189 
heat of the other burning log if you
have<00:01:03.999> a<00:01:04.059> log<00:01:04.269> that's<00:01:04.420> burning<00:01:04.660> really<00:01:05.019> well

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
have a log that's burning really well

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.110 
have a log that's burning really well
then<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.470> put<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:05.710> by<00:01:05.830> itself<00:01:06.130> it'll<00:01:06.880> go<00:01:06.970> out

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
then you put it by itself it'll go out

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.390 
then you put it by itself it'll go out
after<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.510> while<00:01:07.750> but<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:08.829> you<00:01:08.920> have<00:01:09.009> two<00:01:09.189> logs

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
after a while but if you have two logs

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.800 
after a while but if you have two logs
that<00:01:09.610> are<00:01:09.670> both<00:01:09.850> burning<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.450> they're<00:01:10.630> close

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
that are both burning and they're close

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.660 
that are both burning and they're close
to<00:01:10.990> each<00:01:11.049> other<00:01:11.290> they<00:01:12.100> feed<00:01:12.310> off<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.490> each

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
to each other they feed off of each

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.370 
to each other they feed off of each
other's<00:01:13.000> heat<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.479> fire<00:01:13.689> can<00:01:13.900> go<00:01:14.049> on<00:01:14.200> for

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
other's heat and the fire can go on for

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.300 
other's heat and the fire can go on for
hours<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:14.860> way<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.350> start<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.740> fire<00:01:17.979> I

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
hours that way when I start a fire I

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.880 
hours that way when I start a fire I
like<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.030> pick<00:01:19.299> logs<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.990> pieces<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.619> split

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
will place this broken piece of kindling

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.870 
will place this broken piece of kindling
which<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.500> designed<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.340> without

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
which is designed so that without

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.789 
which is designed so that without
smothering<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.810> fire<00:02:01.840> stutter<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.590> presents

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
smothering the fire stutter it presents

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.859 
smothering the fire stutter it presents
some<00:02:03.070> surface<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.880> wood<00:02:04.060> close<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.719> fire

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
some surface of wood close to the fire

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.880 
some surface of wood close to the fire
started<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.469> will<00:02:05.560> get<00:02:05.710> going<00:02:05.950> quickly

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:22.240 

now<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.920> start<00:02:12.340> my<00:02:12.460> fire<00:02:12.610> start

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.860 

once<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.460> going<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.880> place<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> pieces

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
once it's going I place it on the pieces

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
once it's going I place it on the pieces
of<00:02:25.020> kindling<00:02:27.350> my<00:02:28.350> fire<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.830> pretty<00:02:29.070> much<00:02:29.220> ready

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
of kindling my fire is pretty much ready

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.890 
of kindling my fire is pretty much ready
to<00:02:29.550> go

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
to go

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.390 
to go
then<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.050> place<00:02:31.260> another<00:02:31.560> piece<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.040> slit

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
then I place another piece of slit

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.150 
then I place another piece of slit
firewood<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> flat<00:02:33.420> face<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:34.620> front<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
firewood with a flat face in front of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000 
firewood with a flat face in front of
the<00:02:36.060> firestarter<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.530> maintain<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the firestarter and I maintain that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.530 
the firestarter and I maintain that
distance<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.730> between<00:02:39.030> five<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.270> seven

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
distance of between five and seven

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.500 
distance of between five and seven
centimeters<00:02:40.460> then<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.760> place<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> third<00:02:42.300> piece

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
centimeters then I place a third piece

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.090 
centimeters then I place a third piece
of<00:02:42.660> firewood<00:02:43.020> across<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.560> top<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.980> other

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
of firewood across the top of the other

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.090 
of firewood across the top of the other
two<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:45.120> achieves<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> same<00:02:45.840> principle<00:02:46.620> it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
two this achieves the same principle it

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.880 
two this achieves the same principle it
presents<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.610> face<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.720> fire<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.710> burn

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
presents a face of fire that can burn

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.220 
presents a face of fire that can burn
that<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.640> kept<00:02:51.060> five<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.420> seven<00:02:51.720> centimetres

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that is kept five to seven centimetres

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.990 
that is kept five to seven centimetres
away<00:02:52.350> from<00:02:52.650> both<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.100> other<00:02:53.250> two<00:02:53.490> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
away from both of the other two the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.090 
away from both of the other two the
three<00:02:54.180> logs<00:02:54.510> will<00:02:54.870> feed<00:02:55.320> off<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.560> each<00:02:55.770> other's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
three logs will feed off of each other's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.660 
three logs will feed off of each other's
heat<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> place<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.720> third<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.740> do

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
heat when I place this third one on I do

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.880 
heat when I place this third one on I do
it<00:02:59.850> at<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> bit<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.240> an<00:03:00.330> angle<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.620> can

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it at a bit of an angle so that I can

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.160 
it at a bit of an angle so that I can
create<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.580> gap<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.660> careful

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
create this little gap here I'm careful

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.720 
create this little gap here I'm careful
to<00:03:04.380> place<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.830> logs<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.280> when<00:03:05.580> they

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
to place the logs so that when they

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.310 
to place the logs so that when they
eventually<00:03:05.940> tumble<00:03:06.570> as<00:03:06.720> they<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.020> smaller

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
eventually tumble as they get smaller

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.230 
eventually tumble as they get smaller
they're<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> tumble<00:03:08.459> towards<00:03:08.880> my

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
they're not going to tumble towards my

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.960 
they're not going to tumble towards my
screen<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.800> keep<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.160> space<00:03:11.490> open

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
screen and I keep that space open

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.170 
screen and I keep that space open
because<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.959> want<00:03:13.520> oxygen<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> get<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.970> there

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
because I want oxygen to get in there

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.270 
because I want oxygen to get in there
but<00:03:15.600> also<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.290> flames<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.740> be<00:03:16.860> able<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.070> get

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
but also I want flames to be able to get

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.590 
but also I want flames to be able to get
out<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:17.700> it'll<00:03:17.910> make<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> fire<00:03:18.330> look

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
out because it'll make the fire look

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.680 
out because it'll make the fire look
nice<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.170> what<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.350> call<00:03:19.560> flame<00:03:19.860> action

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
nice this is what I call flame action

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.750 
nice this is what I call flame action
I'm<00:03:21.690> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.110> let<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.380> fire<00:03:22.620> burn<00:03:23.010> while

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
I'm going to let this fire burn while

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.340 
I'm going to let this fire burn while
running<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.300> video<00:03:24.450> camera<00:03:24.900> for<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.110> little

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
running the video camera for a little

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.410 
running the video camera for a little
while<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.830> we<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.700> by<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.000> clock<00:03:27.239> how

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
while and we can see by the clock how

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.690 
while and we can see by the clock how
much<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.810> has<00:03:27.989> passed<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:29.250> see<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.580> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
much time has passed you can see that in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.699 
much time has passed you can see that in
the<00:03:29.790> next<00:03:29.970> little<00:03:30.090> while<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.660> fire<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.530> going

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the next little while this fire is going
