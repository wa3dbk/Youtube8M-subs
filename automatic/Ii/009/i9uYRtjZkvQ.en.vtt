the<00:02:34.500> extra<00:02:35.460> storm<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.030> guess<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.570> then<00:02:36.990> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the extra storm I guess and then the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.370 
the extra storm I guess and then the
aquario<00:02:37.710> wheel<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:39.210> explanation<00:02:40.050> earlier

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
aquario wheel for my explanation earlier

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.440 
aquario wheel for my explanation earlier
I<00:02:43.280> bought<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.520> expecting<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
I bought this expecting you to be a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.540 
I bought this expecting you to be a
little<00:02:45.750> more<00:02:45.959> graphic<00:02:46.410> aggressive<00:02:47.400> so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
little more graphic aggressive so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.620 
little more graphic aggressive so
considering<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.240> an<00:02:48.360> attack<00:02:48.690> type<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
considering it to an attack type but I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.390 
considering it to an attack type but I
guess<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.870> could<00:02:52.050> have<00:02:52.709> thought<00:02:52.980> about<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.340> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
guess I could have thought about it a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.699 
guess I could have thought about it a
little<00:02:53.520> bit<00:02:53.670> more<00:02:54.440> considering<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> only

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
little bit more considering the only

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.220 
little bit more considering the only
reason<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:57.300> attack<00:02:57.540> combos<00:02:57.900> such<00:02:58.050> as

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
reason that the attack combos such as

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.290 
reason that the attack combos such as
storm<00:02:58.560> pegasus<00:02:59.070> our<00:02:59.280> aggressive<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.000> because

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
storm pegasus our aggressive is because
