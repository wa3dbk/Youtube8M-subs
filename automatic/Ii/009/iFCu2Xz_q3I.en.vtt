00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.299
 all the youtube and helmet guys 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.360
 One more video for you here is the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.639
 next is this guy came here all 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.089
 fumbling strong smell of fuel 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 in the exhaling exhaust and such I went 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.660
 I tested the car temperature sensor 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 lady who marked minus 40 degrees 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.480
 they had there I was one he was bad 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 contact but through the terminals I put 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 back is working normal only that same 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.500
 so the time of injection and printing 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 of the collector was high has resistance 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.469
 Sensor sensor defects exchange 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.640
 it further regulation of pressure 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 fuel and 12 neighborhoods work 0.8 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 to 1.2 bar of pressure and the exchange of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 pest mp within the pressure price 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 it the tpi pressure regulator after 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 of these car adjustments already worked 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.250
 the scanner all the parameters in the range 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.040
 of legal type 5 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 even so the smell of fuel in the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.990
 exhaust did not come out with tino 8 all 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.689
 but then I came here with the team 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 to know the nonsense that the help was 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.130
 Sending to SÃ£o Paulo 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.549
 to vote indicating the boss is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.549
 Following 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.080
 she sends 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.080
 up here on the wire here left 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.990
 up to now or in the account 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.369
 she sends 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 this connection understand what puts the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.070
 team is very close 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.560
 when I take it out here from the front of the wire 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:03.080
 and there he is extension of that film 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.080
 when I already lay on the white river 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.170
 when I already lay on the white river speak 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.650
 stuck in the white river 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.290
 measuring and living 24 what happens is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.600
 a 1 to 1 resistance to contact here 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.740
 in the continuation of the film here 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.780
 He must have broken up, thanks. 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.220
 This is a defect in the probe car. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.050
 lambda does a reading 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.530
 only that reading is not enough for 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.140
 Central understood then I already have a 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.800
 video on youtube and dense lambda probe 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.950
 even with a test of a me and here in the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.730
 probe maintains immense value at the tip of the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 whip if that value has arrived is the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.590
 average 30cm after the peep 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.360
 to see if the measurement is even because the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.910
 probe may be sending a signal more 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.090
 This does not reach the central 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.460
 Thank you guys, strong hug to you. 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.140

 our doors new posts 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 and I did some other videos there 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.050
 test hit him and some cool videos there

 for you to do in your house and kitchen 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.360
 Simple, you're going to get some little something. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.370
 will spend something of R $ 1 2 reais there 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.530
 will make a clean on your battery goes 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.230
 stay show ball the electrical contacts 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.550
 Thanks for the great hug 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.550
 for you country health
