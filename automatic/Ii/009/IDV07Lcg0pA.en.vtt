that have their air pump yeah but uh
yeah<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.800> seems<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> common

this<00:00:59.879> car<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.449> remember<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.899> exact<00:01:01.170> code

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this car I don't remember the exact code

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
this car I don't remember the exact code
but<00:01:01.649> uh<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> first

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
but uh you know the way you want a first

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
after it's been sitting overnight or a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
after it's been sitting overnight or a
couple<00:01:09.210> hours<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.659> least<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.350> basically<00:01:10.909> you

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
couple hours at least so basically you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.850 
couple hours at least so basically you
know<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> air<00:01:12.240> pump<00:01:12.540> usually<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.380> kicks<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
know the air pump usually it kicks in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
know the air pump usually it kicks in
after<00:01:14.100> cold<00:01:14.610> start<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.740> supplies

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
after cold start you know it's supplies

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
after cold start you know it's supplies
oxygen<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.460> helps<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> car

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
oxygen so you know your it helps the car

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170 
oxygen so you know your it helps the car
get<00:01:21.840> whomps<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.619> warmer<00:01:23.460> sooner<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.939> helps

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
get whomps get warmer sooner and helps

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.469 
get whomps get warmer sooner and helps
with<00:01:24.210> emissions<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.040> only<00:01:26.189> works<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.330> only

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
with emissions so it only works it only

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.940 
with emissions so it only works it only
runs<00:01:27.689> after<00:01:28.290> cold<00:01:28.530> start

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
runs after cold start

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
runs after cold start
so<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.750> inside

is that is usually one of the tubes is
uh<00:03:12.209> corroded<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.480> got<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> crack<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
uh corroded and it's got a crack in it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.130 
uh corroded and it's got a crack in it
and<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.910> having<00:03:15.910> problem<00:03:16.270> supplying<00:03:16.900> enough

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
and it's having problem supplying enough

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.750 
and it's having problem supplying enough
air<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.130> way<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.280> want<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.580> check<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
air and the way you want to check that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.750 
air and the way you want to check that
is<00:03:19.090> well<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.540> first<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:21.010> intake<00:03:21.340> tube<00:03:21.550> is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
is well the first the the intake tube is

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.790 
is well the first the the intake tube is
there's<00:03:22.360> covers<00:03:22.750> here<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.170> remove<00:03:23.590> these

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
there's covers here so you remove these

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.130 
there's covers here so you remove these
covers<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.690> intake<00:03:25.930> tube

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
covers and then this is the intake tube

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.360 
covers and then this is the intake tube
that<00:03:26.260> goes<00:03:26.320> through<00:03:26.620> air<00:03:26.709> pump<00:03:26.980> from<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.280> air

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
that goes through air pump from your air

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.390 
that goes through air pump from your air
filter<00:03:27.790> housing<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> just<00:03:29.680> want<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.010> check

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
filter housing so I just want to check

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.699 
filter housing so I just want to check
make<00:03:30.640> sure<00:03:30.670> everything<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.620> know

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
make sure everything is a you know

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.740 
make sure everything is a you know
connected<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.489> doesn't<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.420> any<00:03:34.600> cracks

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
connected and doesn't have any cracks

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.830 
connected and doesn't have any cracks
you<00:03:35.019> want<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.230> follow<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.590> down<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:37.330> guess

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
you want to follow this down and I guess

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.820 
you want to follow this down and I guess
it<00:03:37.959> goes<00:03:38.050> without<00:03:38.170> saying<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.680> need<00:03:38.800> to

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
it goes without saying you need to

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.900 
it goes without saying you need to
remove<00:03:39.100> your<00:03:39.450> bumper<00:03:40.450> cover<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.760> don't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
remove your bumper cover and you don't

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.290 
was with the relay and that turned out
to<00:07:25.290> be<00:07:25.440> the<00:07:26.220> only<00:07:26.460> thing<00:07:26.610> I<00:07:26.700> needed<00:07:26.940> to<00:07:27.060> replace

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
to be the only thing I needed to replace

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.800 
to be the only thing I needed to replace
so<00:07:28.290> I<00:07:28.320> guess<00:07:28.590> it<00:07:28.740> depends<00:07:29.540> hopefully<00:07:30.540> for<00:07:30.780> you

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
so I guess it depends hopefully for you

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.540 
so I guess it depends hopefully for you
guys<00:07:31.020> it's<00:07:31.230> the<00:07:31.470> same<00:07:31.680> it's<00:07:31.950> just<00:07:32.130> a<00:07:32.250> relay<00:07:32.520> and

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
guys it's the same it's just a relay and

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.850 
guys it's the same it's just a relay and
not<00:07:32.850> the<00:07:33.030> pump<00:07:33.270> or<00:07:33.540> one<00:07:34.290> of<00:07:34.380> these<00:07:34.500> tubes<00:07:36.860> so

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
not the pump or one of these tubes so

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.070 
not the pump or one of these tubes so
yeah<00:07:38.040> I<00:07:38.070> think<00:07:38.220> that<00:07:38.430> should<00:07:38.730> cover<00:07:39.080> almost

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
yeah I think that should cover almost

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.250 
yeah I think that should cover almost
all<00:07:40.440> the<00:07:40.590> basis<00:07:41.120> as<00:07:42.120> far<00:07:42.180> as<00:07:42.450> diagnosing<00:07:43.080> air

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
all the basis as far as diagnosing air

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.700 
all the basis as far as diagnosing air
