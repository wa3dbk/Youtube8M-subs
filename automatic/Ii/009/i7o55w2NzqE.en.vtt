because but neat as you guys know if
you're<00:00:22.080> following<00:00:22.470> me<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:24.680> am<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:25.920> on

you're following me I am now on

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.480 
you're following me I am now on
something<00:00:26.910> called<00:00:27.060> TPN<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
something called TPN which is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.530 
something called TPN which is
intravenous<00:00:29.490> feeding<00:00:33.590> there's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.680> set<00:00:34.980> up

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
intravenous feeding there's a set up

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.410 
intravenous feeding there's a set up
usually<00:00:36.540> doesn't<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.200> bag<00:00:38.420> saving

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
usually doesn't have that bag saving

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
usually doesn't have that bag saving
this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> yellow<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> other

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
this is just the yellow and the other

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.200 
this is just the yellow and the other
one<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:42.059> fats<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:44.000> they<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.149> all

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
one is my fats and then they get all

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.340 
one is my fats and then they get all
mixed<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.829> down<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.350> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
mixed up and I think down here and it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860 
mixed up and I think down here and it
goes<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:49.980> arm<00:00:50.480> that's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> permanent

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
goes into my arm that's a permanent

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.740 
goes into my arm that's a permanent
thing<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.239> mean<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.570> stays<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.140> permanently

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
thing so I mean it stays in permanently

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
thing so I mean it stays in permanently
the<00:00:57.750> goal<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> gain<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.219> weight<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the goal is to gain some weight and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.130 
the goal is to gain some weight and
hopefully<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.329> stomach<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:00.899> working

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hopefully get my stomach back working

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
hopefully get my stomach back working
again<00:01:03.799> obviously<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.129> I'll<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> stay

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
again obviously if not I'll have to stay

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830 
again obviously if not I'll have to stay
on<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.840> hopefully<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:09.720> do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on this but hopefully we can I can do

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
on this but hopefully we can I can do
this<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.140> nighttime<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
this at nighttime you know I think is

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.890 
this at nighttime you know I think is
just<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> require<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
just so we're going to require a lot of

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
just so we're going to require a lot of
and<00:01:16.549> help<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.680> cleaning<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> everything<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and help and cleaning and everything so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.060 
and help and cleaning and everything so
it's<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:24.200> there's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.590> risk<00:01:25.770> for

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's very very there's a lot of risk for

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.719 
it's very very there's a lot of risk for
a<00:01:26.130> bacteria<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.970> whatnot<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.100> an<00:01:29.100> infection

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
a bacteria and whatnot so an infection

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
a bacteria and whatnot so an infection
because<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.240> all<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> sugars<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.590> fats

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
because of all the sugars and fats

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.490 
because of all the sugars and fats
they're<00:01:32.310> coming<00:01:32.670> through<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.240> tube

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
they're coming through this little tube

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.780 
they're coming through this little tube
so

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.680
