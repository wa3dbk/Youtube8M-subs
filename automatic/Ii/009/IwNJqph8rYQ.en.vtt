remember this is no steam and it's set
to<00:02:05.080> high<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.610> trick<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.150> ironing

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
to high and the trick to the ironing

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.050 
to high and the trick to the ironing
part<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.960> you're<00:02:08.110> going<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.530> place<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.460> down

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
part is you're going to place it down

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.140 
part is you're going to place it down
and<00:02:11.100> then<00:02:12.100> pick<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.850> move<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:15.030> pull<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and then pick it up and move it pull it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.710 
and then pick it up and move it pull it
there<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.660> maybe<00:02:16.900> 10<00:02:17.170> seconds<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.920> that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
there just for maybe 10 seconds of that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.180 
there just for maybe 10 seconds of that
and<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.370> heat<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.910> melting<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.690> wax<00:02:22.900> onto<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and the heat is melting the wax onto the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.420 
and the heat is melting the wax onto the
whisper<00:02:24.550> white<00:02:24.730> piece<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.300> cardstock<00:02:25.600> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
whisper white piece of cardstock and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.720 
whisper white piece of cardstock and
that's<00:02:27.430> what<00:02:27.580> we<00:02:27.700> want<00:02:29.220> okay<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
that's what we want okay so do that a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's what we want okay so do that a
couple<00:02:30.820> times<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.870> make<00:02:32.020> sure<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.320> get

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
couple times just to make sure you get

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.790 
couple times just to make sure you get
the<00:02:32.560> whole<00:02:32.739> piece<00:02:32.980> covered<00:02:34.620> okay<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.709> then

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
the whole piece covered okay and then

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 
the whole piece covered okay and then
you<00:02:35.890> don't<00:02:36.100> want<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.400> go<00:02:36.520> like<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.060> like<00:02:37.570> you

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
you don't want to go like this like you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.229 
you don't want to go like this like you
typically<00:02:38.440> do<00:02:38.680> when<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.950> iron<00:02:39.239> because

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
typically do when you iron because

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.630 
typically do when you iron because
that's<00:02:40.420> gonna<00:02:40.600> move<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.410> wax<00:02:41.650> around<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
that's gonna move the wax around and you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.670 
that's gonna move the wax around and you
won't<00:02:42.790> get<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.180> definite<00:02:43.600> image<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.500> wax

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
won't get the definite image of the wax

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.350 
won't get the definite image of the wax
paper<00:02:44.830> when<00:02:45.310> we<00:02:45.430> crinkled<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.090> up

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
paper when we crinkled it up

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.660 
paper when we crinkled it up
okay<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.010> first<00:02:48.370> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
okay so then this is the first one

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330 
okay so then this is the first one
you're<00:02:49.510> not<00:02:49.630> gonna<00:02:49.750> see<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.050> on<00:02:50.380> camera<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
you're not gonna see that on camera and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.140 
you're not gonna see that on camera and
then<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> second<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:53.020> okay<00:02:54.150> all

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
then this is the second one okay all

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.430 
then this is the second one okay all
right<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.450> let's<00:02:55.600> go<00:02:55.750> ahead<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.050> move<00:02:56.170> this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440
