00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.000
 greet you friends my name is denis 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.990
 borisov you are on channel xiv th 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.850
 life.ru 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.609
 and now we will talk about such 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.499
 important exercise as breeding 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
 dumbbells lying on an incline bench and on 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.820
 horizontal bench than this exercise 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.429
 different from the classic bench press 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 dumbbell too lying on horizontal or 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.730
 sloping bench 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.310
 first of all what works in this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.150
 exercise less joint is exercise 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.790
 isolated 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.780
 therefore, it only has 1 joint 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.480
 one joint is the shoulder joint of any other 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 basic exercises with dumbbells or with 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 we have a barbell at least two 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.270
 our joint is running the shoulder joint at 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.220
 us working elbow and what is it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.560
 does that mean that we have 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.540
 more muscle groups are used in 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.490
 particulars of this movement let's say 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.660
 perform triceps and if we do 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.460
 dumbbell breeding 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 we don't have this movement anymore 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 accordingly the triceps doesn't work what 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.679
 it means it means that we have less 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 work minor muscle groups 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:12.299
 respectively, almost the entire array 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.579
 load focus on falls on that area 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.170
 which we train that is in this 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.969
 exercise you will not be able to work with 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.229
 very big weights and skip 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.579
 some kind of power records 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.049
 but in this exercise you can 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.539
 filigree precision focus 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.170
 load precisely on the muscle over which 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:36.050
 you work exactly your breasts like this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.330
 everything looks in principle the rule 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.120
 output to the initial state such 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.500
 the same as when dumbbell bench press you put 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.260
 dumbbells on your knees 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.830
 then lean back and your knees 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.360
 do not throw dumbbells to the starting point 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.400
 throwing dumbbells raise them up 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.290
 especially the starting position is to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.570
 the fact that our feet are not at the bottom but 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.640
 above due to this i am eliminating 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.680
 possible lower back deflection because 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.750
 deflection of the loin it removes the load from 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.960
 our nursing babies and our task is not to do 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 it is easier for them to live but rather to complicate them 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.680
 existence therefore we raise legs 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 up is the ultimate. 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.700
 here is the lowest point at the lowest point we 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.100
 we lower the dumbbell and as low as possible but 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.440
 try to avoid pain and unpleasant 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420
 pain that was not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.100
 there should only be such a nice 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.640
 pain when your chest stretch 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.210
 muscles 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.890
 top dumbbell points touch each other 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.070
 a friend besides going on 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.000
 additional extra reduction 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.200
 chest we like one dumbbell 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 moving towards another ie we 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.870
 crush each other due to this we 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.410
 there is an additional reduction 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.650
 bottom . 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.500
 sprawled top cut 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 now about the chest i am not 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.300
 thinking about bringing the shoulder blades together 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.660
 I am thinking about filling the chest 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.060
 the cell is oxygen, that is, that is, it is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.650
 I kind of bulge forward 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.120
 respectively pectoral muscles 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.130
 smeared across the chest and behind 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.989
 due to this they stretch better and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.270
 shrink better is very important to do everything 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.280
 smoothly and at the end points to pause 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.390
 low points due to this happening 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.550
 stretching 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870
 peak occurs at the top 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.260
 contraction i have muscles 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.989
 additionally reduced chest 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.250
 inflated i move dumbbells very slowly 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.430
 when they go down I dial 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.320
 air when going up releasing 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.330
 air 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:45.519
 scored air sprained chest 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.519
 gathered nursing cuts thoracic together 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.480
 the chest is constantly inflated 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.310
 condition 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.310
 chest muscles work to the limit 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.459
 exercise is very very effective but 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.840
 it can never be used 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.430
 as basic 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.379
 this exercise can be used in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.249
 end of workout after you have already 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.980
 have worked 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:12.819
 heavy loads in basic exercises 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.689
 in general it is the breeding of dumbbells lying 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.689
 baby 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.090
 this 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.530
 works of dumbbells lying like nowhere 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.970
 an important moment of reversing your records then 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.040
 So we can not soup Rowan and brush 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.860
 can their book that is a soup can 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.150
 do not wish to turn aside 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.800
 thumb 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.220
 but we can book to deploy 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.430
 the little finger side you know my position on 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.010
 this account I am a supporter of booking 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.750
 eat initially you can 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.450
 avoid booking summation and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.490
 do and in the lower top point so that 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.920
 you dumbbells were parallel to each other 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.380
 that is, dumbbell vultures as you see y 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.690
 me at the lowest point and the top they 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.910
 parallel to each other can 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.220
 try option foot raban im 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.210
 dumbbell is such a position when here you are 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.290
 from this point and up you sort of 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.810
 turn them in the direction of the big 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.330
 finger and the top point of it becomes 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.130
 parallel 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.110
 understand here dumbbells 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.480
 point by fingerboard down fingerboard is 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.060
 will take the secular 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.490
 and the top positions are parallel to each 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.390
 friend dumbbells parallels 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:00.390
 This is such a way to engage in work. 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.550
 pectoralis lower muscles after 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.340
 as you master you can use 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.840
 the third option in my opinion is more 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.670
 focused when you dumbbells 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.100
 book that is the lowest point dumbbells 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.600
 parallel to each other and the top . not 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.890
 lining up on one line sprawled 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.770
 dumbbells are parallel on one line 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:32.090
 dumbbells parallel to each other dumbbells 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:35.480
 one line parallel one line 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:40.970
 parallel to one line 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.970
 this dumbbell breeding lying baby
