00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640 
is a little chilly and a lot of times we

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.250 
is a little chilly and a lot of times we
don't<00:00:11.730> think<00:00:11.850> about<00:00:12.090> doing<00:00:12.390> weed<00:00:12.720> control<00:00:12.900> in

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
don't think about doing weed control in

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.320 
don't think about doing weed control in
the<00:00:13.380> fall<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.850> it's<00:00:14.970> one<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the fall but actually it's one of the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.210 
the fall but actually it's one of the
times<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:15.930> can<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:17.039> good

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
times that we can get some very good

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.100 
times that we can get some very good
control<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.640> those<00:00:17.940> most<00:00:18.180> difficult<00:00:18.720> pesky

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
control of those most difficult pesky

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.160 
control of those most difficult pesky
weeds<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.680> Speedwell<00:00:20.670> ground<00:00:21.360> ivy<00:00:21.780> and<00:00:21.869> wild

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
weeds like Speedwell ground ivy and wild

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.170 
weeds like Speedwell ground ivy and wild
violet<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:23.190> also<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.610> good<00:00:23.760> time<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
violet it also is a good time of the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.640 
violet it also is a good time of the
year<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.420> pick<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.930> other<00:00:25.020> ones<00:00:25.320> like

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
year to pick up some other ones like

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
year to pick up some other ones like
dandelion<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.460> clover<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> tend<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
dandelion and clover that tend to be in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
dandelion and clover that tend to be in
everybody's<00:00:28.289> yard<00:00:28.730> now<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> us<00:00:30.630> get

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
everybody's yard now a lot of us get

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.300 
everybody's yard now a lot of us get
cooped<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> winter<00:00:31.710> time<00:00:31.920> when<00:00:32.039> we<00:00:32.160> see

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
cooped up in the winter time when we see

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.130 
cooped up in the winter time when we see
those<00:00:32.489> weeds<00:00:32.790> flowering<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> spring<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
those weeds flowering in the spring and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
those weeds flowering in the spring and
we<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.710> ready<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> go<00:00:35.790> out

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
we get ready to go we want to go out

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.180 
we get ready to go we want to go out
there<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> control<00:00:36.870> those<00:00:36.989> weeds

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
there and we want to control those weeds

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.520 
there and we want to control those weeds
but<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.340> happens<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.030> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.290> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
but what happens is when you go out in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.049 
but what happens is when you go out in
the<00:00:40.620> springtime<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.460> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> control

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the springtime and you want to control

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
the springtime and you want to control
this<00:00:42.239> dandelion<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:43.559> gonna<00:00:43.680> put<00:00:44.220> your

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this dandelion you're gonna put your

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
this dandelion you're gonna put your
herbicide<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.660> burn<00:00:45.930> down

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
herbicide on and it's gonna burn down

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
herbicide on and it's gonna burn down
this<00:00:46.350> top<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> plants<00:00:47.219> concentrating<00:00:47.880> I'm

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this top the plants concentrating I'm

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.270 
this top the plants concentrating I'm
putting<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.570> new<00:00:48.809> growth<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.350> but

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
putting all this new growth up but

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.590 
putting all this new growth up but
you're<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.790> get<00:00:50.940> any<00:00:51.090> herbicide

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you're not going to get any herbicide

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930 
you're not going to get any herbicide
down<00:00:51.840> into<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.230> tap<00:00:52.469> root<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.670> for

down into this tap root and for
perennial<00:00:54.360> plants<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> real

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
perennial plants this is the real

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
perennial plants this is the real
they're<00:00:56.219> saving<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> where<00:00:57.149> they're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
they're saving this is where they're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.760 
they're saving this is where they're
getting<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.719> their<00:00:57.840> growth<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.590> from

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
getting all their growth from is from

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
getting all their growth from is from
this<00:00:58.890> tap<00:00:59.129> root<00:00:59.430> that<00:01:00.030> direction<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> growth

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this tap root that direction of growth

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
this tap root that direction of growth
in<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> springtime<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.950> from<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
in the springtime is going from the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.850 
in the springtime is going from the
roots<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.300> shoots<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.500> burn<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
roots to the shoots so you might burn it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.170 
roots to the shoots so you might burn it
down<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.280> you'll<00:01:05.430> come<00:01:05.549> back<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> month<00:01:06.060> later

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
down but you'll come back a month later

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730 
down but you'll come back a month later
and<00:01:06.450> there'll<00:01:06.690> be<00:01:06.720> another<00:01:07.020> dandelion<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and there'll be another dandelion in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
and there'll be another dandelion in
that<00:01:07.890> same<00:01:08.100> spot<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.420> bonus<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> doing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that same spot the bonus of doing

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
that same spot the bonus of doing
something<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> fall<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.790> as

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
something like this in the fall is as

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
something like this in the fall is as
the<00:01:12.510> temperatures<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.140> cooler<00:01:13.380> outside<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the temperatures get cooler outside that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
the temperatures get cooler outside that
direction<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> growth<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:15.780> roots<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
direction of growth goes from roots to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
direction of growth goes from roots to
shoots<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.549> switches<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.000> shoots<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
shoots and it switches to shoots to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
shoots and it switches to shoots to
roots<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.590> plant<00:01:19.860> starts<00:01:20.159> storing

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
roots and so the plant starts storing

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
roots and so the plant starts storing
energy<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.299> tap<00:01:21.570> root<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> when

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
energy down in this tap root and when

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
energy down in this tap root and when
you<00:01:22.560> go<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.010> apply<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> herbicide<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you go out and apply a herbicide in the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
you go out and apply a herbicide in the
fall<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.600> herbicide<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> follow

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
fall that herbicide is going to follow

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.500 
fall that herbicide is going to follow
that<00:01:26.100> direction<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> growth<00:01:26.850> down<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
that direction of growth down into that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.149 
that direction of growth down into that
tap<00:01:27.810> root<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> compromise

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
tap root and it's going to compromise

drawback of putting it on in the fall as

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
drawback of putting it on in the fall as

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you don't get to see it die because the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.249 
you don't get to see it die because the

this tap root and compromising that you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
this tap root and compromising that you
won't<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> lot<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> activity<00:01:41.040> on

the new growth is occurring but next

the new growth is occurring but next
spring<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.780> things<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:47.070> weeds

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
spring when things get going your weeds

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
spring when things get going your weeds
will<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> gone<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.659> mentioned

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
will be gone and like I mentioned

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
will be gone and like I mentioned
earlier<00:01:49.350> there's<00:01:49.619> certain<00:01:49.950> pesky<00:01:50.369> weeds<00:01:50.520> like

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
earlier there's certain pesky weeds like

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
earlier there's certain pesky weeds like
like<00:01:51.570> ground<00:01:51.869> ivy<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.380> wild<00:01:52.740> violet<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
like ground ivy and wild violet that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.920 
like ground ivy and wild violet that
just<00:01:53.670> can't<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.970> controlled<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.780> any

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just can't be controlled really any

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.990 
just can't be controlled really any
other<00:01:55.110> time<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> year<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.490> fall<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
other time of the year and so fall is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
other time of the year and so fall is
really<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> best<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.140> fall

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really the best and when we say fall

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.749 
really the best and when we say fall
we're<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:58.829> looking<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> first

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
we're probably looking at the first

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
we're probably looking at the first
couple<00:02:00.060> weeks<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.329> October<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> get

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
couple weeks of October you want to get

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
couple weeks of October you want to get
out<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.890> either<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.369> before<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> leaves

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
out there either just before the leaves

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
out there either just before the leaves
fall<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.600> wait<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.890> after<00:02:05.220> you've

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
fall or wait and do it just after you've

you're comfortable with pretty much the
easiest<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.670> will<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> little<00:02:27.720> more

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
easiest thing but will be a little more

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.720 
easiest thing but will be a little more
expensive<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.620> getting<00:02:29.250> something<00:02:29.460> that's

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
expensive is getting something that's

what we call our tea you are ready to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.890 
what we call our tea you are ready to
use<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:32.640> case<00:02:32.940> they've<00:02:33.660> already

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
use and in this case they've already

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.840 
use and in this case they've already
mixed<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> water<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
mixed the water with it and put it in a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.790 
mixed the water with it and put it in a
container<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.770> just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
container we can go out and you're just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.820 
container we can go out and you're just
going<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> spray<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> weed<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.650> get

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
going to spray that weed just to get

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.000 
going to spray that weed just to get
some<00:02:41.040> droplets<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.640> those<00:02:41.820> leaf<00:02:42.060> surface

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
some droplets on those leaf surface

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.280 
some droplets on those leaf surface
another<00:02:44.010> option<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.820> go<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.210> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
another option would be to go with a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.540 
another option would be to go with a
something<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.040> also<00:02:47.190> has<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
something like this that also has a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.070 
something like this that also has a
little<00:02:47.880> bit<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.090> fertilizer<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.050> see

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
little bit of fertilizer in it you see

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140 
little bit of fertilizer in it you see
in<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.440> case<00:02:49.710> again<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.760> ready<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.060> use

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
in this case again this is ready to use

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.330 
in this case again this is ready to use
but<00:02:51.960> they're<00:02:52.110> gonna<00:02:52.200> hook<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:52.890> up<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.130> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
but they're gonna hook this up to your

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.610 
but they're gonna hook this up to your
garden<00:02:53.910> hose<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.900> going<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.080> siphon<00:02:55.350> out

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
garden hose and it's going to siphon out

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.710

going and wetting the lawn the most
traditional<00:03:04.770> way<00:03:04.920> would<00:03:05.100> be<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.250> buy<00:03:05.460> a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
traditional way would be to buy a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.730 
traditional way would be to buy a
concentrated<00:03:06.360> product<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.960> if<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.590> do

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
concentrated product and if you do

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.290 
concentrated product and if you do
something<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.490> you're<00:03:08.730> gonna<00:03:08.850> need<00:03:09.090> to

something like that you're gonna need to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.420 
something like that you're gonna need to
knock<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.660> down<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:10.140> find<00:03:10.590> some<00:03:10.860> way<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.010> dilute

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
knock it down or find some way to dilute

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.220 
knock it down or find some way to dilute

amount<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:31.110> your<00:03:31.230> garden<00:03:31.560> hose<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.100> then

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
amount with your garden hose and then

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
amount with your garden hose and then
when<00:03:32.430> you're<00:03:32.550> done<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.850> take<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.210> off<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.660> put

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
when you're done you take it off and put

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.870 
when you're done you take it off and put
it<00:03:34.230> away<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:34.920> never<00:03:35.130> had<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.490> open<00:03:35.610> this

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it away and you never had to open this

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.580 
it away and you never had to open this
container<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.050> situation

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
container and so this is a situation

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
container and so this is a situation
where<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.130> never<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.490> any<00:03:38.760> exposure<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.330> any

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
where you never have any exposure to any

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.080 
where you never have any exposure to any
of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.750> concentrated<00:03:40.470> material<00:03:40.910> they<00:03:41.910> also

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
of the concentrated material they also

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.660 
of the concentrated material they also
have<00:03:42.300> fertilizers<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.260> insecticides<00:03:43.770> so<00:03:44.580> if

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
have fertilizers and insecticides so if

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
have fertilizers and insecticides so if
you<00:03:44.730> wanted<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> spray<00:03:45.240> your<00:03:45.360> rose<00:03:45.570> bushes<00:03:45.900> or

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
you wanted to spray your rose bushes or

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.510 
you wanted to spray your rose bushes or
fertilize<00:03:46.710> your<00:03:46.860> yard<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.400> other

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
fertilize your yard they have other

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.120 
fertilize your yard they have other
products<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.240> line<00:03:48.830> finally<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.980> could

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
products in this line finally you could

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.040 
products in this line finally you could
use<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> granular<00:03:50.940> product<00:03:51.240> so<00:03:51.630> they'd<00:03:51.810> have

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
use a granular product so they'd have

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.020 
use a granular product so they'd have
the<00:03:52.320> herbicide<00:03:52.860> loaded<00:03:53.280> onto<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.580> fertilizer

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
the herbicide loaded onto a fertilizer

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.660 
the herbicide loaded onto a fertilizer
granule<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.440> case<00:03:55.740> you're<00:03:56.370> wanting

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
granule and in that case you're wanting

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.370 
granule and in that case you're wanting
to<00:03:56.700> get<00:03:56.910> those<00:03:57.120> flakes<00:03:57.450> onto<00:03:57.900> those<00:03:58.050> leaves

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
to get those flakes onto those leaves

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.930 
to get those flakes onto those leaves
and<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.800> probably<00:03:58.950> want<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.700> while

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
and so you probably want to do it while

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.550 
and so you probably want to do it while
the<00:04:00.090> turf<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.510> wet<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.080> can<00:04:01.230> get<00:04:01.380> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
the turf is wet and you can get that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.380 
the turf is wet and you can get that
those<00:04:01.860> flakes<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.400> stick<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.850> leaves<00:04:03.090> as

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
those flakes to stick to the leaves as

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.990 
those flakes to stick to the leaves as
you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.350> imagine<00:04:04.860> getting<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.550> material

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
you can imagine getting the material

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.220 
you can imagine getting the material
into<00:04:06.210> the<00:04:06.300> plant<00:04:06.570> with<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.900> kind<00:04:07.140> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
into the plant with that kind of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.600 
into the plant with that kind of
delivery<00:04:07.560> system<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.070> little<00:04:08.340> bit<00:04:08.430> more

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
delivery system is a little bit more

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.220 
delivery system is a little bit more
difficult<00:04:09.090> than<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.630> some<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.930> these<00:04:10.020> other

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
difficult than with some of these other

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.230 
difficult than with some of these other
products<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:10.890> that's<00:04:11.400> why<00:04:11.610> using<00:04:11.940> those

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
products and that's why using those

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.000 
products and that's why using those
products<00:04:12.660> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> fall<00:04:13.110> as<00:04:13.410> one<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.800> times

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
products in the fall as one of the times

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.950 
products in the fall as one of the times
where<00:04:14.220> they<00:04:14.310> work<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.700> best<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.540> something

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
where they work the best so something

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.090 
where they work the best so something
that<00:04:15.990> might<00:04:16.230> be<00:04:16.380> out<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> one<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.890> step

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
that might be out of one of the step

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.160 
that might be out of one of the step
program<00:04:17.340> type<00:04:18.150> fertilizers<00:04:18.810> that's<00:04:18.989> going<00:04:19.109> to

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
program type fertilizers that's going to

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.500 
program type fertilizers that's going to
have<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.350> broadleaf<00:04:19.950> herbicide<00:04:20.239> now<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.270> have

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
have a broadleaf herbicide now I have

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.300 
have a broadleaf herbicide now I have
some<00:04:21.720> examples<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:22.320> most<00:04:22.710> stores<00:04:23.040> have

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
some examples here most stores have

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.130 
some examples here most stores have
their<00:04:23.460> own<00:04:23.580> store<00:04:23.910> brand<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.479> most<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
their own store brand and most of the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.810 
their own store brand and most of the
products<00:04:25.500> have<00:04:25.620> many<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.100> same<00:04:26.310> materials

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
products have many of the same materials

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.250 
products have many of the same materials
in<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.360> pick<00:04:28.020> some

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
in it so pick some
