00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
spawner however that was more so with

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400 
spawner however that was more so with
two<00:00:20.670> blocks<00:00:20.939> across<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.140> much

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
two blocks across we can do one much

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.820 
two blocks across we can do one much
more<00:00:22.740> compact<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.910> block<00:00:24.150> across<00:00:24.830> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
more compact with one block across the

infinite water source to do this you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.090 
infinite water source to do this you
will<00:00:33.930> need<00:00:34.020> actually<00:00:34.380> two<00:00:34.620> buckets<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> water

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
will need actually two buckets of water

you<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.750> need<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> create<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.320> water<00:00:49.649> source

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you will need to create a water source

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
you will need to create a water source
in<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> corners<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.559> then<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.890> create

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
in one of the corners and then to create

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.529 
in one of the corners and then to create
the<00:00:53.460> infinite<00:00:53.820> water<00:00:53.940> source<00:00:54.030> you'll<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the infinite water source you'll have to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.189 
the infinite water source you'll have to
go<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> opposite<00:00:55.289> corner<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.660> just<00:00:57.660> drop

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
go to the opposite corner and just drop

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
go to the opposite corner and just drop
it<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.300> our

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it there as you can see now all for our

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.670 
it there as you can see now all for our
source<00:01:01.530> blocks<00:01:01.829> which<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
source blocks which you can now take and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
source blocks which you can now take and
it'll<00:01:04.680> continuously<00:01:05.309> replenish<00:01:05.820> itself<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it'll continuously replenish itself so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880 
it'll continuously replenish itself so
this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.990> known<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.170> an<00:01:07.439> infinite

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this is what is known as an infinite

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.570 
this is what is known as an infinite
water<00:01:08.040> source<00:01:09.409> now<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.100> entrance

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
water source now as for your entrance

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
water source now as for your entrance
what<00:01:11.880> you'll<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:12.630> sure<00:01:12.840> that

what you'll want to do is make sure that
you<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.619> block<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.000> entrance<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you actually block off the entrance of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.370 
you actually block off the entrance of
each<00:01:16.049> floor<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.250> signs

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
each floor that you want with signs

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.820 
each floor that you want with signs
simple<00:01:19.380> enough<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.890> sure<00:01:20.820> hope<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.200> okay<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.619> as

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
simple enough I sure hope so okay so as

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910 
simple enough I sure hope so okay so as
this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.570> floor<00:01:25.020> level<00:01:25.710> what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this is going to be the floor level what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.210 
this is going to be the floor level what
you'll<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> create<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.000> water

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
you'll want to do is create a water

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.270 
you'll want to do is create a water
right<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:30.530> sign<00:01:32.600> water<00:01:35.450> sign<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
right there sign water sign and just so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
right there sign water sign and just so
forth<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> you'll<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.630> able<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.840> keep

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
forth and so on you'll be able to keep

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
forth and so on you'll be able to keep
on<00:01:40.170> repeating<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.740> until<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.340> reach<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
on repeating this until you reach the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.130 
on repeating this until you reach the
next<00:01:42.090> level<00:01:44.329> just<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> jump<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.899> here

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
next level just going to jump up here

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560 
next level just going to jump up here
and<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.649> quickly<00:01:47.040> create<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.240> signs

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and really quickly create two more signs

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.940 
and really quickly create two more signs
right<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.320> drop<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> down

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
right there so we can now drop this down

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
right there so we can now drop this down
and<00:01:54.259> replenish<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.070> water

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and replenish with some more water

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.590 
and replenish with some more water
blocks<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.939> have<00:01:59.969> four<00:02:00.360> more

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
blocks so now that we have four more

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
blocks so now that we have four more
buckets<00:02:01.020> worth<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.380> water<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
buckets worth of water we can go on to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.980 
buckets worth of water we can go on to
the<00:02:02.520> next<00:02:02.790> level<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.270> again<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.780> pretty

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the next level and again it's pretty

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.760 
the next level and again it's pretty
much<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> same<00:02:04.469> deal<00:02:04.740> all<00:02:04.979> over<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.500> being

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
much the same deal all over so one being

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.339 
much the same deal all over so one being
a<00:02:08.220> waters<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:09.270> being<00:02:09.450> assigned<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.050> being<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a waters one being assigned one being a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.650 
a waters one being assigned one being a
water<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.920> being<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.220> sign<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:12.270> best<00:02:12.450> part

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
water one being a sign the best part

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
water one being a sign the best part
about<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.020> its<00:02:13.319> actual

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
about this is its actual

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
about this is its actual
kind<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> fun<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.760> know<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:15.239> through<00:02:15.659> once

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
kind of fun to you know go through once

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.410 
kind of fun to you know go through once
you're<00:02:16.200> ready<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:17.489> will<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.939> lower

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you're ready and this will not lower

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.910 
you're ready and this will not lower
your<00:02:20.030> oxygen<00:02:21.030> levels<00:02:21.360> or<00:02:21.780> anything<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.799> that

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
your oxygen levels or anything like that

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.270 
your oxygen levels or anything like that
because<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.700> sign<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:25.650> kind<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.129> in

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
because of the sign that's kind of in

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.860 
because of the sign that's kind of in
between<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:28.019> your<00:02:28.260> water<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.819> sign<00:02:29.870> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
between you know your water and sign so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.589 
between you know your water and sign so
I<00:02:31.200> mean<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.459> very<00:02:32.489> creative<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.239> fun<00:02:33.450> way

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
I mean it's a very creative and fun way

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.440 
I mean it's a very creative and fun way
to<00:02:33.629> do<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.109> it's<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:35.340> overall<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> great

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
to do it and it's just overall a great

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.630 
to do it and it's just overall a great
way<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.530> much<00:02:37.709> more<00:02:37.859> I<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.040> say<00:02:38.099> about<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
way not much more I can say about it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.649 
way not much more I can say about it
really<00:02:39.829> in<00:02:40.829> order<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> get<00:02:41.939> up<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.209> hold<00:02:42.480> down

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
really in order to get up you hold down

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.229 
really in order to get up you hold down
space<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.409> order<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.099> down<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.939> kind

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
space in order to go down you just kind

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.129 
space in order to go down you just kind
of<00:02:45.299> let<00:02:45.540> go<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.379> let<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.010> current<00:02:47.250> take<00:02:47.519> you

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
of let go and let the current take you

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.280 
of let go and let the current take you
just<00:02:49.139> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.349> create<00:02:50.099> another<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.290> here

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
just going to create another one here

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
just going to create another one here
and<00:02:52.609> unfortunately<00:02:53.609> don't<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.790> enough

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and unfortunately don't have enough

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
and unfortunately don't have enough
water<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:54.659> okay<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.530> basically

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
water but that's okay this basically

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.530 
water but that's okay this basically
just<00:02:56.250> goes<00:02:56.430> through<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> basics<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.359> how<00:02:57.389> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
just goes through the basics on how to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.009 
just goes through the basics on how to
create<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.319> water<00:02:58.980> elevator<00:02:59.549> don't<00:03:00.359> forget<00:03:00.629> to

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
create a water elevator don't forget to

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.420 
create a water elevator don't forget to
once<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.620> go<00:03:01.829> through<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.189> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
once you actually go through this to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.869 
once you actually go through this to
create<00:03:02.670> some<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:04.430> lighting<00:03:05.430> system

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
create some kind of lighting system

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.970 
create some kind of lighting system
which<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.620> level<00:03:07.829> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
which you want to do on the level of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.039 
which you want to do on the level of
where<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.400> sign<00:03:08.639> is<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.299> won't<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:09.930> any

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
where the sign is so you won't have any

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.800 
where the sign is so you won't have any
spillage<00:03:10.909> whether<00:03:11.909> it's<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.180> torch<00:03:12.510> whether

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
spillage whether it's a torch whether

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.390 
spillage whether it's a torch whether
it's<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> glowstone<00:03:13.590> block<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.220> is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
it's a glowstone block that is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.199 
it's a glowstone block that is
completely<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.599> you<00:03:15.780> isn't<00:03:16.139> it<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:18.120> yeah

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209
