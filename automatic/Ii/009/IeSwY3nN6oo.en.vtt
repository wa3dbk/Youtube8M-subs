00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
races and one of the ways you can bust

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
races and one of the ways you can bust
races<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
races is like this what you do is you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
races is like this what you do is you
just<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.629> front<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> stop<00:01:01.410> them

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just get in front of them you stop them

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.520 
just get in front of them you stop them
and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.550> AI<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> stupid<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.260> they

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and the AI are kind of stupid and they

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
and the AI are kind of stupid and they
don't<00:01:04.710> understand<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.430> reverse<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.689> much

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
don't understand about reverse very much

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
don't understand about reverse very much
so<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.920> try<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.189> drive<00:01:08.670> forward

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so they will just try and drive forward

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
so they will just try and drive forward
and<00:01:09.240> try<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> drive<00:01:10.020> away<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and try to drive away from you so you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
and try to drive away from you so you
can<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.140> I'm<00:01:13.290> going

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
can do it that way just like I'm going

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
can do it that way just like I'm going
to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.799> again<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to do it here again you can see that I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
to do it here again you can see that I
get<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.600> front<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> car<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.830> stop<00:01:17.130> him

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
get in front of the car and I stop him

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
get in front of the car and I stop him
from<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.549> any<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.270> goes<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.840> try

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
from going any kind of just goes I try

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
from going any kind of just goes I try
and<00:01:19.680> drive<00:01:20.070> through<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.600> doesn't

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and drive through you and it doesn't

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
and drive through you and it doesn't
really<00:01:22.049> work<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:23.009> don't

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
really work because they don't

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
really work because they don't
understand<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> concept<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> reverse

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
understand the concept of reverse

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
understand the concept of reverse
apparently<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
apparently so that's one way you can

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
apparently so that's one way you can
bust<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> guys<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.100> just

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bust the guys and the other way is just

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
bust the guys and the other way is just
by<00:01:29.720> damaging<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> damage<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
by damaging them so when you damage a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.679 
by damaging them so when you damage a
whole<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.250> cars<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.790> them<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.509> low

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
whole other cars and get them really low

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109
