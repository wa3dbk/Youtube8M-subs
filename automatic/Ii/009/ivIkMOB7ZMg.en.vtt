00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.730
 yes hello my dear youtuber friends 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.750
 Now my tooth cmk 1 is finally 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.400
 arrived 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.370
 and then I thought I would do it now 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.620
 just an unboxing and review 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:28.210
 yes you see you the number one man 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:33.300
 zalman zm with 1 high-end microphone stands 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.629
 on it ok, high end will be seen 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 I bought it all at amazon for 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.660
 with shipping scarce ten euro or so 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.999
 approximately 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.469
 habs ordered a week ago or something 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:48.249
 and now it's finally time 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.739
 arrived 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:55.899
 Yesterday evening , that's how it looks 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 packed and I'll do that now 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.149
 open up and then we'll see 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 I'm always so good when it comes to that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.170
 opening of such packaging will 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 By the way, you are listening to me right now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 over the microphone of my camera and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.550
 afterwards I will become the number one 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.520
 plug in and then hear me about it 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.380
 then you have to see what it's for 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.540
 difference is and if there is one 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.340
 difference is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 I want to hope very much otherwise the holds 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 all the fucking is not worth it here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.650
 are only 10 euro but not mean 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.930
 yes that's it now unpacked we have 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.750
 here the plug for plugging the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:59.410
 jack on the front of the microphone is such a 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.580
 then you can do a small clip 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.970
 get down to his headset cable off 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.080
 but that is not so great 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.950
 I have that in the descriptions 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.859
 read 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.430
 that does not raise that much because of it 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:19.849
 it is still here on the cable 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:24.799
 distributes such small clips 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:28.450
 clips things level where you just then 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:33.260
 can attach a cable 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.950
 yes I'll do it on here now 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 it would go out 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.599
 the cable is relatively long can 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.280
 but somehow can be clever too 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.250
 disturbing so I always need one 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.530
 a bit longer because if I'm here 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.459
 Any app reviews are that way 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.840
 and app tests then i need them 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.510
 a bit longer when I get up 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.040
 and such 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.799
 yes that's pretty good 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.230
 So it is the cable is very long 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.639
 I think that's easy for people 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.940
 just want to buy replacement as a headset for 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.949
 it's kind of like gambling or something 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.209
 awkward this length but for me 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:27.169
 is quite useful 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.810
 yes, I will do it all now 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:33.769
 connect my computer and then 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.299
 heard me right across the room microphone 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:41.269
 until now would have me over that 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.250
 Zahlmann note with 1 I have it myself 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.159
 stuck here unfortunately it works with 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.650
 This clip of the here is not so 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.849
 all that was way too big now 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.569
 I must look only times that I 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.090
 because war so I have to me a 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.519
 bit with such a paper clip 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.069
 but I'll do it too 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.560
 still trying to optimize yes from 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.949
 sounded like I'm really crazy in the 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.829
 against my to my camera from 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:12.739
 canon that is really outstanding for 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.689
 So this 650's the sound quality at least 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.220
 I think that's how it is 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.169
 just like the comments in her comments 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.090
 sound quality so what I wanted to say 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.510
 I unfortunately do not yet 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.550
 the zahlmann cmk 1 works on that 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.380
 I will connect the microphone 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.180
 but also still 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.230
 because and if so then I'm doing there 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.440
 maybe just another one 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.720
 little video about it then that 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.230
 also know if you do it sometimes 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.650
 i hope i liked the video and it 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 has you to look at that and made fun 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.070
 maybe even the necessary offense 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.630
 given that salman cmk 1 to buy 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.900
 I can only recommend it to you 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.640
 really the six â‚¬ 50 worth then looked 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.930
 I will match and see you next time 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.930
