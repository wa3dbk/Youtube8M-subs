Activision<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.800> guess<00:03:07.950> did<00:03:08.520> make<00:03:09.300> me<00:03:09.510> websites

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
Activision I guess did make me websites

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.900 
Activision I guess did make me websites
this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.410> all<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.830> new<00:03:10.920> names<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.370> them<00:03:11.520> and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this is all the new names of them and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.800 
this is all the new names of them and
they<00:03:12.690> call<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.990> duty<00:03:13.230> part<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.630> guess

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
they call of duty part of it so I guess

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.190 
they call of duty part of it so I guess
there<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.070> probably<00:03:17.820> what<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.840> title<00:03:19.080> is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
there this is probably what the title is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560 
there this is probably what the title is
going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.530> along<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.209> would

going to be along this if this would

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.860 
going to be along this if this would
happen<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:23.370> say<00:03:23.820> we're<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.330> going<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.750> go

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
