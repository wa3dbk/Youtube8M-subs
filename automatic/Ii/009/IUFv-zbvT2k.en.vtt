blended<00:03:35.260> some<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.799> best<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.489> it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
blended some of the best and if it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.759 
blended some of the best and if it
you'll<00:03:37.239> have<00:03:37.419> chunks<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.900> vanilla<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.590> there

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
you'll have chunks of vanilla in there

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.280 
you'll have chunks of vanilla in there
where<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:40.209> compost<00:03:40.629> turn<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> role<00:03:41.049> of

actually blending just you know like a
mixer<00:03:43.690> there<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.590> mix<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.400> wagon<00:03:45.699> ill

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
mixer there you have to mix a wagon ill

mixer there you have to mix a wagon ill
mix<00:03:46.060> everything<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:46.510> for<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.049> take

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
mix everything that for you to just take

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.539 
mix everything that for you to just take
it<00:03:47.319> out<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.470> put<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.859> scoops<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.280> in<00:03:48.370> fact

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
it out and put it in scoops and in fact

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.580 
it out and put it in scoops and in fact
your<00:03:48.730> pickup<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.060> then<00:03:49.239> work<00:03:49.449> the<00:03:49.599> thing<00:03:49.810> so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
your pickup and then work the thing so

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.839 
your pickup and then work the thing so
it's<00:03:51.569> it's<00:03:52.569> it's<00:03:52.919> well<00:03:53.919> worth<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.310> money<00:03:54.340> do

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
it's it's it's well worth the money do

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.289 
it's it's it's well worth the money do
it<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.810> just<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.139> know<00:03:56.489> it's<00:03:57.489> car<00:03:57.699> you<00:03:58.150> know

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
it it's just you know it's car you know

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.750 
it it's just you know it's car you know
you<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.859> do<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.040> with<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.160> talk<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.579> them<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you can do it with a talk to them a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.849 
you can do it with a talk to them a
nurse<00:04:00.910> better<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.870> even<00:04:02.109> turning<00:04:02.319> out<00:04:02.620> but

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
nurse better it's even turning out but

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.860 
nurse better it's even turning out but
that<00:04:03.040> time<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.609> money<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:04.419> you're<00:04:04.599> putting

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that time and money that you're putting

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.680 
that time and money that you're putting
in<00:04:04.959> there

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
in there

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.470 
in there
maybe<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.320> lot<00:04:06.410> easier<00:04:06.710> for<00:04:06.860> this<00:04:07.130> machine<00:04:07.360> if<00:04:08.360> I

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
maybe a lot easier for this machine if I

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
maybe a lot easier for this machine if I
do<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.720> right<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.050> first<00:04:09.080> time

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
do it right the first time

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.240 
do it right the first time
then<00:04:10.430> observation<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.210> a<00:04:11.480> lot<00:04:11.960> better<00:04:12.250> so

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
then observation that a lot better so

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.700 
then observation that a lot better so

lot<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.680> moisture<00:04:24.800> out<00:04:25.010> but<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.400> don't<00:04:25.430> get

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
lot of moisture out but you don't get

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.070 
lot of moisture out but you don't get
the<00:04:25.730> heat<00:04:25.940> built<00:04:26.210> up<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.630> get<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.840> passengers

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
the heat built up to get the passengers

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.810 
the heat built up to get the passengers
out<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:28.130> if<00:04:28.190> you're<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.310> trying<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.670> knock

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
out now if you're just trying to knock

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.930 
out now if you're just trying to knock
the<00:04:28.850> moisture<00:04:29.300> out<00:04:29.330> I'd<00:04:29.540> say<00:04:29.860> 510<00:04:30.860> two<00:04:31.730> weeks

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the moisture out I'd say 510 two weeks

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.030 
the moisture out I'd say 510 two weeks
at<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.120> most<00:04:32.210> fertile<00:04:32.930> files<00:04:33.410> are<00:04:33.620> set<00:04:33.890> they

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
at the most fertile files are set they

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.250 
at the most fertile files are set they
take<00:04:34.250> ten<00:04:35.030> days<00:04:35.180> maybe<00:04:35.540> put<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> pile

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
take ten days maybe put it in the pile

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.030 
take ten days maybe put it in the pile
and<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.470> leave<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.740> there

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
and just leave it there

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.490 
and just leave it there
this<00:04:37.970> is<00:04:38.120> probably<00:04:38.570> twenty<00:04:38.870> eight<00:04:38.990> twenty

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
this is probably twenty eight twenty

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.530 
this is probably twenty eight twenty
nine<00:04:39.770> percent<00:04:39.920> moisture<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:41.330> going<00:04:41.450> to

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
nine percent moisture so it's going to

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.200 
nine percent moisture so it's going to
knock<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.690> down<00:04:41.840> pretty<00:04:42.140> fast<00:04:42.410> after<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.860> did

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
knock it down pretty fast after you did

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.390 
knock it down pretty fast after you did
some<00:04:44.210> better<00:04:44.420> barns<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.020> some<00:04:45.200> layer<00:04:46.100> barns

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
some better barns and some layer barns

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.340 
some better barns and some layer barns
that<00:04:46.490> get<00:04:46.640> really<00:04:46.910> wet<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.390> answer<00:04:47.660> 60%

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
that get really wet the answer 60%

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.230 
that get really wet the answer 60%
moister<00:04:48.680> what<00:04:48.980> take<00:04:49.160> quite<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.400> bit<00:04:49.580> but<00:04:50.180> that

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
moister what take quite a bit but that

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.540 
moister what take quite a bit but that
moisture<00:04:50.690> also<00:04:50.930> brings<00:04:51.140> heat<00:04:51.350> we've<00:04:52.100> built<00:04:52.430> a

with<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.200> manure<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:55.160> we<00:04:55.250> added<00:04:55.460> eight<00:04:56.440> well

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
with the manure and we added eight well

with the manure and we added eight well
we<00:04:57.530> started<00:04:57.770> add<00:04:57.860> can't<00:04:58.160> see<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.430> holes<00:04:58.610> and

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
we started add can't see the holes and

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.370 
we started add can't see the holes and
stem<00:04:59.090> other<00:04:59.270> stuff<00:04:59.540> and<00:04:59.690> man<00:04:59.900> it<00:05:00.080> worked<00:05:00.230> out

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
stem other stuff and man it worked out

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.880 
stem other stuff and man it worked out
great

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
great

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.890 
great
just<00:05:01.250> just<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.760> great<00:05:02.030> deal<00:05:02.210> with<00:05:02.450> cotton<00:05:02.780> seed

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
just just a great deal with cotton seed

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.630 
just just a great deal with cotton seed

that<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:06.160> actually<00:05:07.160> looked<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.790> stumped

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
that it actually looked like you stumped

that it actually looked like you stumped
me<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.360> take<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:08.810> door<00:05:09.080> might<00:05:09.650> store<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.370> I

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
me you take this door might store so I

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.520
