00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 good evening to all welcome for this new 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.840
 episode enough mr to start on 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.500
 might have turned on the light the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.240
 little kampf 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.759
 so I launched two hours ago the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.039
 pixel poll as every week for 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.910
 see which collector you want 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.290
 I present you in episodes to smr and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.220
 you voted for this Sunday for the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:50.300
 presentation of the bayonetta collector 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:55.040
 is sure climax on the ps3 a packaging 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.780
 standard one can say to bagadadji but 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.680
 two collectors and rather edition 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.510
 limited in view of the thickness shot I 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.829
 just I just could find it for 15 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.590
 euros in occasion the fnac 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.390
 gold after finding old collectors 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 that is, years that they are 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.700
 released before 2010 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.110
 you have the Caribbean in 2009 nine goes in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.940
 2009 in stockings used 29 years is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.350
 complicated good it's true we can 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.259
 find for a quarantine 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.310
 fifty euros on the internet 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.679
 and I'm always looking for good 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 small business does it need to talk 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:35.440
 collector so well we'll see 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.440
 what's in this box 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.869
 blue metal shoes yes what he has me 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.149
 because I did not know about 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.420
 European and at site it was done by 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.009
 platinumgames a little father was a little 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.899
 more 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.659
 well me it makes me think is what are 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.450
 the same developers that goes from 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.399
 quidditch to where I still have 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.229
 the last hardest trophy was 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.640
 blocked to see the platinum trophy 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:19.450
 it's a little parenthesis for two 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 years we have seen the format this object 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.720
 it's an album of video game music 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:42.130
 only six musicians then see 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:44.440
 the author hiroshi yamaguchi fun of 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.870
 yamaguchi would have to look who 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:53.380
 it is made as a section of his fate 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:57.880
 the level of design to the game of audio cd 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:02.910
 it really makes me think of the dvd 's 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.910
 silent hill right game without the drop of 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 show why talking about it is nice 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.709
 for them but if they took shape the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.020
 Thu 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.590
 of course there are heaps 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.900
 not tested yet but this is 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.370
 for soon 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.880
 my brother does not stop getting drunk for 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.210
 zizou harm I have plenty of games to 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.890
 playing does not force me every thing in 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.960
 his time 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.780
 so avenged on tomb raider the last 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.530
 on abs 3 and just in the tree to 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.530
 other sectors 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:56.910
 the classic a goat of the game one could 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.170
 to say that the personality of the heroine of the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.640
 game the long-awaited day has arrived 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.350
 bayonetta is now available 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.180
 in retrospect I remember 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.430
 first your our yusuke producer 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.350
 hashimoto behind the project 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.420
 I would like to see this game again 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.090
 of 3d action led by bibi who 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.680
 truck the studio is still in its infancy 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.940
 bayonetta is so a very important game 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.740
 for platinum games 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.930
 it is this lack it will meet a success 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.870
 with the players and that he will mark the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 start of a beautiful adventure between us 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.040
 according to the memories I think that 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:45.330
 vanquish 28 days ago is out 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:48.560
 after bayonetta to come back and come he 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.560
 weird podium monsters 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:00.910
 following wiki dozens of the character I 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.660
 would say that the corresponding proportions 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.520
 to 9 of the blow to explain his 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.130
 camps in the drawing 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.900
 when we say that the character we 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.780
 dressings leave a good appearance 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:19.060
 that his head is not ninth of his 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.040
 his body for bass c17 and if one 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.470
 take the example of sonic character 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.040
 it respects the 1,300 conventions itself 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.460
 note in the lard truck n 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.260
 really had a little head 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.540
 the difference the head between her thighs 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:46.420
 it's a little bit of abuse that's a 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:54.370
 style you were a character plus these 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:57.120
 enzo networks it makes me think of 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.120
 parents suffered 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:13.050
 little and what he is not he pays 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:20.029
 a go himself he how much they 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.029
 call this is not super top 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:28.500
 here is the skin is obvious well skinny in 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:33.360
 this mistletoe max edition a miserable one 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:39.689
 firefighter not even thicker cmo than my 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:47.270
 little finger to the music album and they 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:47.270
 have to go in there not even funny 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.240
 but does not specify what awaits a voice 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.460
 the decision of mas saint chÃ©ly pana 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.569
 bouquet of 36 pages as well and others 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.650
 representatives 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.969
 taking the music of a game 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.009
 ajanta principle I thought they 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:08.520
 had me x 18 x 2 0 there by cons see 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:10.229
 to be no tlc sherry me i'm amazed 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.520
 of what usually in the sixteen years 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:15.060
 collections around tlc 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:19.199
 but do not have it, it's over for this 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.449
 collector that you thought of it for 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.509
 me as usual for 15 euros that 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:28.289
 remains a beautiful collector and you have some 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:30.620
 thought what about this manual of the week 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.620
