00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:25.000
 This two hundred webs mouse standard in principle 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.039
 For Khimki, then two our seven milestones 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.710
 century and large enough group and heels 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.100
 in principle, the setup is not enough 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.530
 Standard for Khimki so also without st 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.809

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.500
 will be playing there 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.780
 everything happens from 5 or more verticals 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 rushes tassels powerful stand on 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.850

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.280
 vertical group and fifth passes forward 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.780
 passes it passes them a little something that is not 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.380
 glow itself does not shine yet 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.689
 Opponents appear to be skill 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.909
 play either banana or de vertical banana 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.909
 base or over the mountain 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.750
 it's not clear here they were playing through the city 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.350
 shone there will be these guys here but everyone 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.860
 the bush stops 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.630
 gives from arrows and 5 pass and meets 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.990
 first kitty. 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.890
 no need to go crazy climbed noticed new 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.570
 boom now she runs away very fast and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.090
 fifth poke 2 weave more or less even 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.930
 pierce not all of course projectiles legs 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.209
 while normal and pass weave gave 2 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.740
 of 2 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.520
 the wall should take away all the same it is very 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.140
 fast all cars -11 great good 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.100
 Damage fugasik interesting interom 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.290
 12 seconds already trying to pick up a hundred and 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.220
 Well done all the world still took a hundred 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 spending a lot of time 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.420
 coming out. shoots at 700 and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.910
 dying your mistake fr-shki happened here 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.920
 bilateral chamber has not yet struck and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.330
 ok look here we get 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:57.130
 6 and five fight with four skills 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.930
 shooting controls the flash drive after which 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.550
 short of such shelling and 5 on 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.970
 getting quite a decent amount 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.769
 damage goes to d vertical to take 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.500
 scram 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.410
 nothing foretold trouble for the wall but 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.010
 Skills come in three cars to capture 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:20.650
 and three cars cover seizure 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.480
 rather successfully 66 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 heavier wall must still 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.170
 keeps wins for the most was 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.410
 about six cars dismantled 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:37.989
 the flash drive of the wall again gives the exact hall not 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.989
 kosyachit on 1700 flies every time 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.269
 account those two here remains 5 6 cars 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.060
 skills one of which is two 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.280
 the rest are quite large against times 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.049
 two three 4 5 wall machines 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 5 to 6 advantage in skills and clearly 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.510
 and come back and 5 if one has time 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.459
 well that is, the forces here must now 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.569
 put a good focus and principle 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.120
 disassemble the wall 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:14.060
 all the time on the other flank 2 and 5 or 3 5 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.959
 7 horse 2 stages go to the rescue and in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:22.840
 six wall machines to defend against 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:29.180
 only 3 skills make it easy 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.610
 32 wall shorts and simka 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.310
 kind of satellite because we are watching 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.229
 for him ripleys but most likely he 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.530
 enough words given that he tanks 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:43.550
 and in the meantime incomprehensible happening 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:48.310
 item 12 3 after 73 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.850
 yes yes those same four five wall machines 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.020
 which all skills were originally survived 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.389
 died 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.389
 one tank advantage here 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.840
 nikakuschy focus is not that breaking even 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.090
 could happen i don't understand given 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.830
 that they shot the mouse as much as possible 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.110
 pierce point and the 52 th is not necessary to clear 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.090
 take 2s as it will be wrong 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 difficult 15 percent and weaving in the hangar 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.770
 15 3 wall win
