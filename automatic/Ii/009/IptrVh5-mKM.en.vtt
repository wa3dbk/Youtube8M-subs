which is a very we can just call it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570 
which is a very we can just call it
unique<00:00:24.480> lmg<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.099> anything<00:00:26.340> else

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
unique lmg it's not like anything else

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.890 
unique lmg it's not like anything else
that's<00:00:26.730> been<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.000> game<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.359> past<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
that's been in the game in the past and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
that's been in the game in the past and
it's<00:00:28.019> completely<00:00:28.349> new<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.490> some

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's completely new so there are some

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
it's completely new so there are some
things<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.029> need<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.359> learned<00:00:30.660> from

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
things that need to be learned from

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.080 
things that need to be learned from
using<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.320> gun<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> use<00:00:32.910> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
using this gun and when you use it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.729 
using this gun and when you use it's
gonna<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> can't<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.590> an

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
gonna you on so you can't use it as an

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
gonna you on so you can't use it as an
actual<00:00:34.980> LLG<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> change<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.149> play

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
actual LLG you have to change your play

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.299 
actual LLG you have to change your play
style<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:37.980> used<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
style from that so if you are used to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
style from that so if you are used to
using<00:00:38.460> LMGs<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> switch<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
using LMGs it's time to switch it up a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
using LMGs it's time to switch it up a
little<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.469> using<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.100> chainsaw<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
little bit because using the chainsaw it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
little bit because using the chainsaw it
will<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.210> quite<00:00:42.629> differently<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.980> let's<00:00:44.100> see

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
will be quite differently so let's see

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.950 
will be quite differently so let's see
some<00:00:44.399> stats<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.120> chainsaw<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
some stats about the chainsaw in this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.880 
some stats about the chainsaw in this
game<00:00:47.690> alright<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> chainsaw<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> fully

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
game alright so the chainsaw is a fully

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
game alright so the chainsaw is a fully
automatic<00:00:50.219> LMG<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> built-in<00:00:51.570> laser

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
automatic LMG with a built-in laser

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
automatic LMG with a built-in laser
sight<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.289> hipfire<00:00:52.860> only<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.239> much

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sight in hipfire only so pretty much

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
sight in hipfire only so pretty much
this<00:00:54.539> gun<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.260> says<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> only<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.190> used<00:00:56.340> on

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this gun it says it can only be used on

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
this gun it says it can only be used on
a<00:00:56.489> hip<00:00:56.699> fire<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.809> tame

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a hip fire but you actually can tame

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.709 
a hip fire but you actually can tame
down<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.260> site<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
down your site it's not very you it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
down your site it's not very you it's
not<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> usual<00:01:01.260> aiming<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.100> site<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
not the usual aiming down your site it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
not the usual aiming down your site it's
a<00:01:02.520> bit<00:01:02.699> different<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
a bit different so it's not going to be

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
a bit different so it's not going to be
as<00:01:04.320> accurate<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.670> using

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
as accurate as you would think in using

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
as accurate as you would think in using
the<00:01:06.750> laser<00:01:06.900> sight<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.409> does<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.710> make

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the laser sight it does actually make

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
the laser sight it does actually make
your<00:01:08.310> hipfire<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.729> lot<00:01:09.060> better<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> would

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
your hipfire a lot better so I would

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
your hipfire a lot better so I would
recommend<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> over<00:01:10.500> aiming<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.310> your

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
recommend that over aiming down your

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
recommend that over aiming down your
site<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.140> recoil<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> gun<00:01:14.010> does

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
site so the recoil on this gun does

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
site so the recoil on this gun does
stabilized<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.790> sustained<00:01:15.299> fire<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
stabilized with sustained fire so that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719 
stabilized with sustained fire so that
means<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.530> guns<00:01:16.770> shooting<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> longer

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
means as your guns shooting the longer

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.940 
means as your guns shooting the longer
it<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.180> shoot<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.990> less<00:01:19.170> recoil<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.799> will

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it will shoot the less recoil you will

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.350 
it will shoot the less recoil you will
have<00:01:20.100> its<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> weird<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.880> reverse

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have its kind of weird it's reverse

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.580 
have its kind of weird it's reverse
recoil<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> want<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
recoil if you want to think of it that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
recoil if you want to think of it that

final thoughts I believe that the fact

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.520 
final thoughts I believe that the fact
that<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.420> chainsaw<00:03:56.810> has<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.140> highest

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that the chainsaw has the highest

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.930 
that the chainsaw has the highest

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.819 
mobility and rate of fire ins class
combine<00:03:59.269> well<00:03:59.540> with<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.930> built-in<00:04:00.230> laser<00:04:00.380> for

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
combine well with the built-in laser for

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.190 
combine well with the built-in laser for

gun<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.650> game<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:03.950> built-in<00:04:04.340> laser<00:04:04.519> is

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
gun in the game of the built-in laser is

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.080 
gun in the game of the built-in laser is
that

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.030 
that
Rx<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> completely<00:04:06.650> different

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
Rx and that is a completely different

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.800 
Rx and that is a completely different
set<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.489> it's<00:04:07.610> kind<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:07.879> cool<00:04:08.120> have<00:04:08.510> two

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
set up so it's kind of cool have two

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.229 
set up so it's kind of cool have two
different<00:04:08.989> built-in<00:04:09.440> laser<00:04:09.530> guns<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:11.000> kind

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
different built-in laser guns this kind

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.850 
different built-in laser guns this kind
of<00:04:11.269> is<00:04:11.420> in<00:04:11.599> my<00:04:11.750> opinion<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:12.200> hybrid<00:04:12.709> between

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
of is in my opinion a hybrid between

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.659 
of is in my opinion a hybrid between
assault<00:04:13.430> rifles<00:04:13.790> smgs<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.840> LMGs<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.489> best

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
assault rifles smgs and LMGs as the best

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.979 
assault rifles smgs and LMGs as the best
of<00:04:16.850> all<00:04:16.970> those<00:04:17.090> rules<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.449> it<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:17.870> used

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
of all those rules and it can be used

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.509 
of all those rules and it can be used
but<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.380> only<00:04:18.590> thing<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.949> I<00:04:18.979> do<00:04:19.070> not<00:04:19.370> like

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
but the only thing that I do not like

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.340 
but the only thing that I do not like
about<00:04:19.699> this<00:04:19.850> gun<00:04:20.090> is<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.299> lack<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.750> aim<00:04:21.109> down
