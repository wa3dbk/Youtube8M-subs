00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 skin has the tone that corresponds to us 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.079
 what colors correspond to it is a 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.999
 quality 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.159
 it is a quality that normally 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.080
 warm ones have their skin color 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.149
 butter gives how we are seeing it or 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.799
 it would be these nor white ivory 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.439

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.659
 with the colors goes sex that the color 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.210
 base of a quality are all the coffees 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.310
 all the green bronzes going through the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.670
 yellows going through the oranges to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 she rules the sun ok then we go to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.780
 see if we put the if the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 we can focus well because the skin 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.049
 immediately pulls out if it repels him or 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.690
 like it for being a quality or a 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.700
 spring is going to mark a lot 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.440
 lines of expression the lines of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.270
 face expression now if we put him 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.380

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.070
 let your tone pass here we are putting the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 coffee 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.920
 you immediately see that your skin 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.870
 its colors all the warm ones are 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.150
 golden or carry everything now 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.190

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.140
 of white to give it then as 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.940
 we knew exactly how we're going to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.330
 watch the video look at it and there it is in 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.650

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.590
 honest that the color of your hair is the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.780
 natural 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.659
 I do not know why Latinas 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.939
 love to disguise ourselves there really is god 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.220
 we do not have to be web but look at my 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.930
 compatriot who has the darkest skin 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 this attitude I recommend now we are going to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.430
 start her them to winter she is 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.560
 a cold the cold ones usually we 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 the colors are very strong as in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.310
 my case also this green 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 emerald adel but webb we are going to put 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.269
 this blue ok 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.319
 this blue more of her this blue is of 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.090
 a warm 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.790
 now let's put that it does not taste bad 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.650
 They will say it looks good but because they go well 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.379
 when we can see spectacular mona 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.480

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.069
 blue that corresponds to him and I want him 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:11.569
 see what good 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:15.349
 now let's see in the video look 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.200
 karina of an uncle's pink since it has left 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.700
 perfect now the warm ones also 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.950
 they can steal a bit of those from 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.659
 winter using these same tones but 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.859
 in shades in lighter or pastel shades 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.959
 they have skin color that is very 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.969
 Latino common between us is very 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.090
 very latin Latinas we have the color 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:38.150
 of olive- yellow skin as you say or 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.340
 light tan normally the cold ones we 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.939
 we associate tans more faster 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.489
 more easily than the colors that the 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.430
 autumn the springs let's put 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.099
 first that is the green value and this one without 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.349
 falling from the street does not correspond to seeing 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.180
 immediately gets green 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.310
 They put the same color is very important 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.560
 when going shopping lady go 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.329
 with washed face and be honest and 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.630
 then the other one now let's see the 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.610
 contrast 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.740

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.959
 The animal print coffee are for 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.810
 warm not for the cold but you have to 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.370

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.510
