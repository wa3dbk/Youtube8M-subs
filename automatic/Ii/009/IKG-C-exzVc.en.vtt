00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
goes he aims first shot is very normal

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.540 
goes he aims first shot is very normal
and<00:00:14.160> then<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:16.020> second<00:00:16.410> shot<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and then the second shot and the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090 
and then the second shot and the
quickscope<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.840> right<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.590> gonna<00:00:19.740> play<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
quickscope all right I'm gonna play this

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.859 
quickscope all right I'm gonna play this
again<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.460> slow<00:00:20.850> motion<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> see<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
again in slow motion so you can see it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
again in slow motion so you can see it
one<00:00:22.020> sec

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.280 

so<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.270> is<00:00:27.450> his<00:00:27.690> first<00:00:27.930> shot<00:00:28.850> normal<00:00:29.850> sir

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.650 

then<00:00:32.500> look<00:00:32.680> at<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:32.890> pre-fire<00:00:33.310> here<00:00:33.610> look<00:00:34.540> at

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
then look at the pre-fire here look at

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.580 
then look at the pre-fire here look at
this<00:00:34.780> try<00:00:35.970> watching<00:00:36.970> boom<00:00:37.480> he<00:00:37.780> shoots<00:00:37.990> much

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
this try watching boom he shoots much

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.340 
this try watching boom he shoots much
before<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.280> guy<00:00:39.430> comes<00:00:39.730> out<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:41.200> the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
before the guy comes out then the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.140 
before the guy comes out then the
noscope<00:00:41.740> I<00:00:41.920> don't<00:00:42.370> even<00:00:42.460> know<00:00:42.700> how<00:00:42.850> he<00:00:42.880> got

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
noscope I don't even know how he got

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.350 
noscope I don't even know how he got
that<00:00:43.330> shit<00:00:43.570> for<00:00:43.930> obviously<00:00:44.470> trigger<00:00:45.360> hit

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
that shit for obviously trigger hit

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.900 
that shit for obviously trigger hit
through<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.630> box

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
through the box

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.250 

all<00:00:52.000> right<00:00:52.150> so<00:00:52.330> here<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.540> see<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.870> put<00:00:52.930> this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
all right so here you see you put this

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.470 
all right so here you see you put this
cross<00:00:53.560> around<00:00:53.830> the<00:00:53.980> guy

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.750 

you<00:00:58.930> can<00:00:59.140> tell<00:00:59.410> he<00:00:59.680> wasn't<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.160> moving<00:01:00.640> his

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
you can tell he wasn't just moving his

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
you can tell he wasn't just moving his
hand<00:01:01.000> he<00:01:01.450> aimed<00:01:01.660> at<00:01:01.840> him<00:01:01.960> for<00:01:02.610> about<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.640> second

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hand he aimed at him for about a second

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.080 
hand he aimed at him for about a second
you<00:01:05.350> want<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.590> say<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.790> clip<00:01:07.000> you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
you want to say that in this clip you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.910 
you want to say that in this clip you
can<00:01:07.210> see<00:01:07.420> him<00:01:07.540> literally<00:01:07.930> posit<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.740> guy

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
can see him literally posit the guy

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.900 
can see him literally posit the guy
while<00:01:09.280> looking<00:01:09.580> long<00:01:09.820> on<00:01:10.090> his<00:01:10.150> head<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.920> turn

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
while looking long on his head then turn

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.070 
while looking long on his head then turn
around<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.270> look<00:01:13.420> at<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.600> smoke

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
around and look at the smoke

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.230 
around and look at the smoke
there<00:01:14.410> was<00:01:14.560> probably<00:01:14.760> obviously<00:01:15.760> no<00:01:15.910> reason

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
there was probably obviously no reason

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.320 
there was probably obviously no reason
to<00:01:16.450> even<00:01:17.020> peek<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.130> wall<00:01:18.310> because<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:19.240> had

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
to even peek that wall because you had

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.620 
to even peek that wall because you had
the<00:01:19.450> smoke<00:01:19.690> there<00:01:19.960> so<00:01:20.710> it's<00:01:20.860> just<00:01:21.180> him<00:01:22.180> having

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
the smoke there so it's just him having

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.289 
the smoke there so it's just him having
no<00:01:22.750> sense<00:01:23.050> with<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> wallhack

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 

all<00:01:27.899> right<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> one's<00:01:28.320> pretty<00:01:28.469> funny<00:01:28.740> one

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
all right this one's pretty funny one

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
all right this one's pretty funny one
because<00:01:29.219> watch<00:01:29.789> first<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:30.780> throws<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because watch first of all he throws the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.569 
because watch first of all he throws the
smoke<00:01:31.380> he<00:01:31.590> knows<00:01:31.740> exactly<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.460> they're

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
smoke he knows exactly that they're

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
smoke he knows exactly that they're
going<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.479> before<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> round<00:01:34.109> starts

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
going there like before the round starts

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.480 
going there like before the round starts
you<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.649> them<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.340> takes

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you see them all going there he takes

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
you see them all going there he takes
the<00:01:35.759> smoke<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.450> middle<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> first

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the smoke on middle and that's the first

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
the smoke on middle and that's the first
smoke<00:01:38.399> he<00:01:38.549> does<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:39.090> game<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
smoke he does all game right there on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
smoke he does all game right there on
the<00:01:40.920> same<00:01:41.100> round<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.789> he<00:01:42.450> looks<00:01:42.659> at

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the same round they go there he looks at

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
the same round they go there he looks at
them<00:01:42.899> through<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> wall<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> first<00:01:43.860> time

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
them through the wall for the first time

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.109 
them through the wall for the first time
he<00:01:45.149> looks<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.569> again<00:01:45.719> and<00:01:46.729> kills<00:01:47.729> cuz<00:01:48.000> he

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
he looks at them again and kills cuz he

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.209 
he looks at them again and kills cuz he
has<00:01:48.209> really<00:01:48.509> bad<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.079> yeah

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.270
