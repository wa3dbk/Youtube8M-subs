have a rave review to do about them but
before<00:00:28.239> I<00:00:28.269> get<00:00:28.390> into<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.749> just<00:00:28.989> wanted<00:00:29.230> to

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
before I get into that I just wanted to

before I get into that I just wanted to
explain<00:00:29.739> a<00:00:30.189> few<00:00:30.519> things<00:00:30.579> about<00:00:30.970> some<00:00:31.419> breads

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
explain a few things about some breads

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.200 
explain a few things about some breads
really<00:00:32.320> quickly<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:33.460> there<00:00:33.640> are<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.910> few

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
really quickly so there are a few

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.480 
really quickly so there are a few
different<00:00:34.510> types<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:35.079> breads<00:00:35.710> first<00:00:36.130> of<00:00:36.340> all

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
different types of breads first of all

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.730 
different types of breads first of all
so<00:00:36.730> there<00:00:36.940> are<00:00:37.090> things<00:00:37.480> like<00:00:37.540> raw<00:00:37.840> bread<00:00:38.110> which

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
so there are things like raw bread which

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.910 
so there are things like raw bread which
raw<00:00:39.010> bread<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.670> basically<00:00:40.180> made<00:00:40.480> from<00:00:40.920> things

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
raw bread is basically made from things

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.470 
raw bread is basically made from things
like<00:00:42.130> vegetables<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.730> fruits<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.090> nuts<00:00:43.150> and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
like vegetables and fruits and nuts and

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.820 
like vegetables and fruits and nuts and
seeds<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.930> they're<00:00:44.020> all<00:00:44.140> ground-up<00:00:44.680> and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
seeds and they're all ground-up and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.860 
seeds and they're all ground-up and
mushed<00:00:45.100> together<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.790> most<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.570> them<00:00:46.720> are

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
mushed together and most of them are

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.860 
mushed together and most of them are
either<00:00:46.990> not<00:00:47.290> heated<00:00:47.770> at<00:00:48.280> all<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:49.000> dehydrated

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
either not heated at all or dehydrated

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.800 
either not heated at all or dehydrated
or<00:00:50.110> only<00:00:50.410> heated<00:00:51.990> under<00:00:53.490> 116<00:00:54.490> degrees<00:00:54.810> 118

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
or only heated under 116 degrees 118

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.150 
or only heated under 116 degrees 118
degrees<00:00:55.900> it<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.380> depends<00:00:56.680> on<00:00:56.770> which<00:00:56.950> raw

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
degrees it just depends on which raw

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.040 
degrees it just depends on which raw
foodist<00:00:57.580> you're<00:00:57.730> talking<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.270> they<00:00:58.840> don't

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
foodist you're talking to they don't

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.420 
foodist you're talking to they don't
heat<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.380> past<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.710> certain<00:00:59.860> point<00:00:59.980> because

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
heat it past a certain point because

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.610 
heat it past a certain point because
they<00:01:00.580> believe<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.180> enzymes<00:01:01.720> which<00:01:02.290> are<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
they believe that enzymes which are the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.149 
they believe that enzymes which are the
living<00:01:03.220> parts<00:01:03.520> of<00:01:03.730> food<00:01:04.210> are<00:01:05.199> what<00:01:05.650> we<00:01:05.799> need<00:01:06.009> to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
living parts of food are what we need to

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.490 
living parts of food are what we need to
stay<00:01:06.369> alive<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.150> need<00:01:07.180> live<00:01:07.540> food<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.260> stay

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
stay alive we need live food to stay

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.610 
stay alive we need live food to stay
alive<00:01:09.159> then<00:01:09.690> there<00:01:10.690> are<00:01:10.870> your<00:01:11.080> conventional

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
alive then there are your conventional

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.940 
alive then there are your conventional
breads<00:01:11.860> which<00:01:12.010> are<00:01:12.190> full<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.400> corn<00:01:13.000> soy<00:01:13.950> wheat

breads which are full of corn soy wheat

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.750 
breads which are full of corn soy wheat
gluten<00:01:15.510> which<00:01:16.510> are<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.690> lot<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:16.960> inflammatory

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
gluten which are a lot of inflammatory

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.740 
gluten which are a lot of inflammatory
issues<00:01:18.760> with<00:01:19.180> those<00:01:19.330> because<00:01:19.510> they're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
issues with those because they're

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.450 
issues with those because they're
typically<00:01:20.110> genetically<00:01:20.650> modified<00:01:21.130> and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
typically genetically modified and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.850 
typically genetically modified and
they're<00:01:22.060> filled<00:01:22.450> with<00:01:22.570> sugar<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.260> salt<00:01:23.470> and

they're filled with sugar and salt and

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.860 
they're filled with sugar and salt and
there<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.490> very<00:01:24.909> little<00:01:25.210> nutritional<00:01:25.810> value

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
there is very little nutritional value

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.490 
there is very little nutritional value
to<00:01:26.290> them<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.610> lot<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.850> carbs<00:01:28.120> in<00:01:28.270> fact<00:01:28.540> what

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
did you do did you eat regular bread you

sprouted<00:01:44.049> breads<00:01:44.290> now<00:01:44.650> are<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> little<00:01:45.250> bit

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
sprouted breads now are a little bit

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.039 
sprouted breads now are a little bit
different<00:01:45.820> from<00:01:45.909> raw<00:01:46.120> brad's<00:01:46.420> in<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.840> fact

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
different from raw brad's in the fact

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.310 
different from raw brad's in the fact
that<00:01:47.170> when<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> sprouted<00:01:48.909> bread<00:01:49.320> they

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
that when you have a sprouted bread they

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.850 
that when you have a sprouted bread they
actually<00:01:51.070> are<00:01:51.310> cooked<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.560> difference

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
actually are cooked but the difference

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.560 
actually are cooked but the difference
is<00:01:54.010> with<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.400> sprouted<00:01:54.850> bread<00:01:55.000> you're<00:01:55.180> taking

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
is with a sprouted bread you're taking

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.289 
is with a sprouted bread you're taking
the<00:01:55.690> grain<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.320> they<00:01:57.280> are<00:01:57.369> sprouting<00:01:58.180> it

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
the grain and they are sprouting it

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.969 
the grain and they are sprouting it
which<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.960> know<00:01:59.049> you're<00:01:59.440> putting<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.860> in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
which you know you're putting it in

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.670 
which you know you're putting it in
water<00:02:00.280> or<00:02:00.670> something<00:02:00.909> like<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:02.439> the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
water or something like that to make the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.950 
water or something like that to make the
seed<00:02:03.040> start<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.670> germinate<00:02:03.880> creates<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.750> higher

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
seed start to germinate creates a higher

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.859 
seed start to germinate creates a higher
protein<00:02:05.320> content<00:02:05.650> within<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:07.150> grain<00:02:07.420> itself

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
protein content within the grain itself

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.240 
protein content within the grain itself
so<00:02:08.049> you're<00:02:08.170> actually<00:02:08.289> getting<00:02:08.530> more<00:02:08.769> protein

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so you're actually getting more protein

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.789 
so you're actually getting more protein
when<00:02:09.399> you're<00:02:09.489> eating<00:02:09.849> a<00:02:10.000> sprouted<00:02:10.539> bread<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
when you're eating a sprouted bread and

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.250 
when you're eating a sprouted bread and
they<00:02:11.950> are<00:02:12.190> when<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.060> sprout<00:02:13.420> grains<00:02:13.720> such<00:02:14.200> as

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
they are when you sprout grains such as

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.160 
they are when you sprout grains such as
lentils<00:02:14.590> quinoa<00:02:15.069> amaranth<00:02:16.060> before<00:02:16.930> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
lentils quinoa amaranth before you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.580 
lentils quinoa amaranth before you
actually<00:02:17.410> cook<00:02:17.800> them<00:02:18.010> even<00:02:18.340> beans<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:19.690> before

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
actually cook them even beans or before

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
actually cook them even beans or before
you<00:02:20.680> incorporate<00:02:21.130> them<00:02:21.280> into<00:02:21.400> food<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you incorporate them into food it

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.600 
you incorporate them into food it
actually<00:02:22.300> makes<00:02:23.050> them<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> lot<00:02:23.770> easier<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
actually makes them a lot easier to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.850 
actually makes them a lot easier to
digest<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.240> if<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.930> do<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.440> lot<00:02:26.709> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
digest so if you do have a lot of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.640 
digest so if you do have a lot of
bloating<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:28.030> breads<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.200> consumption

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
bloating with breads and the consumption

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.050 
bloating with breads and the consumption
of<00:02:29.740> breads<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:30.310> sprouted<00:02:30.760> bread<00:02:30.940> is

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
of breads then sprouted bread is

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.620 
of breads then sprouted bread is
definitely<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.959> good<00:02:32.410> option<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.920> try<00:02:33.630> sprouted

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
definitely a good option to try sprouted

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.750 
definitely a good option to try sprouted
breads<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.200> raw<00:02:35.349> breads<00:02:35.620> are<00:02:35.770> also<00:02:35.950> typically

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
breads and raw breads are also typically

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.910 
breads and raw breads are also typically
free<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.209> yeast<00:02:37.599> there<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.260> many<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.560> them

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
free of yeast there are not many of them

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.979 
free of yeast there are not many of them
that<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.130> found<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.610> have<00:02:39.849> any<00:02:40.239> yeast<00:02:40.599> at<00:02:40.810> all

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
that I found that have any yeast at all

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.720 
that I found that have any yeast at all
which<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.349> great<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.280> candida

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
which is great if you have a candida

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.199 
which is great if you have a candida
problem<00:02:43.270> or<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.540> sugar<00:02:44.380> addiction<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:45.310> if<00:02:45.910> you

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
problem or a sugar addiction or if you

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.510 
problem or a sugar addiction or if you
are<00:02:46.420> trying<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:47.010> lose<00:02:48.010> weight

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
I did try being a gluten-free girl I did

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.550 
I did try being a gluten-free girl I did
try<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.640> ancient<00:03:29.240> grains<00:03:29.540> which<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> whole

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
try the ancient grains which is a whole

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.070 
try the ancient grains which is a whole
grain<00:03:31.120> gluten-free<00:03:32.120> bread<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.630> they<00:03:32.780> carry

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
grain gluten-free bread that they carry

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.410 
grain gluten-free bread that they carry
and<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.280> thing<00:03:34.460> I<00:03:34.580> liked<00:03:34.850> about<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.240> most

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
and the thing I liked about it the most

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.850 
and the thing I liked about it the most
was<00:03:35.540> because<00:03:35.780> I'm<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.050> nightshade<00:03:36.530> free

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
was because I'm on a nightshade free

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.620 
was because I'm on a nightshade free
diet<00:03:37.070> as<00:03:37.370> well<00:03:37.400> as<00:03:37.610> gluten<00:03:37.880> free<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.390> didn't

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
have any potatoes though that made me

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.610 
have any potatoes though that made me
very<00:03:41.480> happy<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.080> things<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.560> that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
very happy you know and things like that

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.080 
very happy you know and things like that
they<00:03:42.830> tend<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.400> make<00:03:43.550> me<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> little<00:03:43.970> bit

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
they tend to make me a little bit

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.700 
they tend to make me a little bit
bloated<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.690> was<00:03:44.930> really<00:03:45.080> happy<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
bloated so I was really happy that the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.560 
bloated so I was really happy that the
spread<00:03:45.920> didn't<00:03:46.130> contain<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.580> most<00:03:47.150> gluten

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
spread didn't contain that most gluten

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.050 
spread didn't contain that most gluten
free<00:03:47.690> products<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.230> do<00:03:48.320> consume<00:03:48.950> if<00:03:49.400> it's

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
free products that I do consume if it's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.930 
free products that I do consume if it's
sort<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.510> on<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.930> on<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.950> whim<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.640> want<00:03:52.820> a
