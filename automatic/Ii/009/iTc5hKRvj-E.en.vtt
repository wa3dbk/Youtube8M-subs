00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
bone and inner corner right so moving on

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.110 
bone and inner corner right so moving on
to<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.470> liner<00:01:35.680> I'm<00:01:36.040> going<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.580> begin<00:01:36.850> by

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
to the liner I'm going to begin by

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.150 
to the liner I'm going to begin by
applying<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.990> line<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.530> my<00:01:38.680> upper<00:01:38.979> lash

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
applying just a line to my upper lash

00:01:39.160 --> 00:02:01.240 
applying just a line to my upper lash
line

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.460 

and<00:02:01.910> again<00:02:02.150> I'm<00:02:02.300> not<00:02:02.330> being<00:02:02.450> extremely<00:02:03.290> neat

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
and again I'm not being extremely neat

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.500 
and again I'm not being extremely neat
because<00:02:03.860> I'm<00:02:03.980> going<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.280> go<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.150> smoke

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
because I'm going to go in and smoke

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.870 
because I'm going to go in and smoke
that<00:02:05.780> out<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:05.930> little<00:02:06.170> bit<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.550> think<00:02:07.760> I'll

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
that out a little bit and I think I'll

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.340 
that out a little bit and I think I'll
do<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.180> now<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.960> using<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.320> little

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
do that now I'm just using a little

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.970 
do that now I'm just using a little
detail<00:02:12.860> brush<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:18.710> with<00:02:18.860> that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
detail brush to do this so with that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
detail brush to do this so with that
done<00:02:19.250> i'm<00:02:19.550> going<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.970> apply<00:02:20.330> line<00:02:20.780> along<00:02:21.080> my

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
done i'm going to apply line along my

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.740 
done i'm going to apply line along my
lower<00:02:21.350> lash<00:02:21.470> line<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.160> repeat<00:02:22.850> process<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
lower lash line and repeat process of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:34.320 
lower lash line and repeat process of
smudging<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.470> out

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.450 

so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.410> that's<00:02:35.620> pretty<00:02:35.860> good<00:02:36.100> I'm<00:02:36.250> going

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
so I think that's pretty good I'm going

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.570 
so I think that's pretty good I'm going
to<00:02:36.760> add<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> little<00:02:37.570> bit<00:02:37.810> more<00:02:37.840> eyeshadow<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:39.130> it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
to add a little bit more eyeshadow so it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.700 
to add a little bit more eyeshadow so it
sort<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.240> transitions<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.230> little<00:02:41.500> bit<00:02:41.590> more

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
sort of transitions a little bit more

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.400 
sort of transitions a little bit more
