want to do is look at the first image
and<00:00:28.410> apply<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.859> develop<00:00:29.250> settings<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and apply my develop settings like I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
and apply my develop settings like I
want<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.660> look<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> do

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
want it to look so what I'm going to do

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.720 
want it to look so what I'm going to do
in<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.489> particular<00:00:33.059> instance<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.730> like

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
in this particular instance is I like

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
in this particular instance is I like
the<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.450> crop<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.290> tight<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> start<00:00:38.100> with

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the the crop to be tight to start with

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.440 
the the crop to be tight to start with
and<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> end<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> make<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and at the end I'm going to make it a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
and at the end I'm going to make it a
much<00:00:39.540> wider<00:00:39.809> crop<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.500> it'll<00:00:40.739> look<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
much wider crop so it'll look like the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.930 
much wider crop so it'll look like the
camera<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> panning<00:00:43.760> all<00:00:44.760> these

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
camera is kind of panning all these

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
camera is kind of panning all these
images<00:00:45.270> were<00:00:45.360> taking<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> s<00:00:45.840> raw<00:00:46.079> formats

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
images were taking it s raw formats

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.029 
images were taking it s raw formats
which<00:00:46.829> gives<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.930> files<00:00:48.930> aren't<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.680> huge

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
which gives me a files aren't that huge

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
which gives me a files aren't that huge
but<00:00:50.430> gives<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> leeway<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> do

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
but gives me a lot of leeway to do

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.729 
but gives me a lot of leeway to do
develop<00:00:52.739> settings<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.870> get

little bigger that way make sure the
horizon<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.990> straight<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:45.060> also<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> light

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
horizon is straight and also the light

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
horizon is straight and also the light
has<00:01:45.990> changed<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.369> image

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
has changed a little bit in this image

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.490 
has changed a little bit in this image
so<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.479> gotten<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.810> brighter<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so it's gotten a little brighter as the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
so it's gotten a little brighter as the
day<00:01:49.670> wore<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.180> only<00:01:51.299> 15<00:01:51.630> minutes<00:01:51.810> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
day wore on it was only 15 minutes but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
day wore on it was only 15 minutes but
it<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.320> brighter<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.770> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.430> reduce<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it to get brighter I kind of reduce the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.100 
it to get brighter I kind of reduce the
brightness<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.329> beer<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
brightness a little beer make this a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
brightness a little beer make this a
little<00:01:55.170> more<00:01:55.320> dramatic<00:01:55.500> scene<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
little more dramatic scene if you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
little more dramatic scene if you
increase<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> contrast<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.610> maybe

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
increase the contrast a little bit maybe

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.429 
increase the contrast a little bit maybe
increase<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> vibrance<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.600> little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:03.439> just

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
increase the vibrance a little bit just

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.749 
increase the vibrance a little bit just
to<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.799> give<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to kind of give it a little more of a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.070 
to kind of give it a little more of a
dynamic<00:02:06.240> dynamic<00:02:07.170> look<00:02:08.720> ok<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.989> great

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
dynamic dynamic look ok so that's great

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
dynamic dynamic look ok so that's great
so<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:10.739> last<00:02:10.890> image<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> different

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so now the very last image is different

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.240 
so now the very last image is different
then

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
then

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.350 
then
all<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.240> rest<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.600> images<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:15.330> what<00:02:16.330> I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
all the rest of the images so what I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.670 
all the rest of the images so what I
really<00:02:16.660> want<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.200> want<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.380> smooth

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
really want to do is I want a smooth

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440 
really want to do is I want a smooth
transition<00:02:18.160> from<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.640> first<00:02:18.940> image<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
transition from the first image to the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.810 
transition from the first image to the
last<00:02:19.690> image<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.260> there's<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.770> program<00:02:21.700> called

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
last image and there's a program called

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.390 
last image and there's a program called
LR<00:02:22.150> time-lapse<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.930> use<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.370> I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
LR time-lapse I can use to do that so I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.790 
LR time-lapse I can use to do that so I
select<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> images<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.570> want<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> go<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.680> to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
select all the images I want to go up to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.400 
select all the images I want to go up to
the<00:02:26.950> top<00:02:27.160> toolbar<00:02:27.460> here<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.050> want<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.230> be<00:02:29.290> in

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the top toolbar here and I want to be in

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.180 
the top toolbar here and I want to be in
the<00:02:29.500> library<00:02:30.690> module<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:32.140> want<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.709> be<00:02:32.830> on<00:02:32.920> grid

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the library module I want to be on grid

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.280 
the library module I want to be on grid
view<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.850> get<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.630> thing<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.200> work

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
view to get the to get the thing to work

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.620 
view to get the to get the thing to work
correctly<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.760> would<00:02:36.850> be<00:02:36.910> an<00:02:37.030> option<00:02:37.240> aerial

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
correctly that would be an option aerial

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.040 
correctly that would be an option aerial
metadata<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:39.280> want<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.550> do<00:02:40.050> save

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
metadata and you want to do save

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.350 
metadata and you want to do save
metadata<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.740> files<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.730> what<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:42.940> does<00:02:43.000> is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
metadata to files so what this does is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.610 
metadata to files so what this does is
it<00:02:43.390> takes<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> settings<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.410> just

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it takes all the settings that you just

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.690 
it takes all the settings that you just
created<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:47.530> develop<00:02:47.860> module<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.459> writes

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
created in the develop module and writes

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.060 
created in the develop module and writes
them<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.090> actual<00:02:49.480> files<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:50.200> your<00:02:50.680> hard<00:02:50.739> disk

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
them to actual files on your hard disk

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.600 
them to actual files on your hard disk
so<00:02:51.970> task<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.600> completed<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.340> helps

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
so task is completed and it really helps

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.340 
so task is completed and it really helps
to<00:02:54.700> put<00:02:54.850> all<00:02:55.000> these<00:02:55.150> files<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.870> one<00:02:56.080> single

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
to put all these files in one single

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.870 
to put all these files in one single
folder<00:02:56.770> with<00:02:56.890> no<00:02:57.010> other<00:02:57.160> files<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.730> aren't

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
folder with no other files that aren't

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.610 
folder with no other files that aren't
part<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.239> time<00:02:58.450> lapse<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.020> folder<00:02:59.230> so

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
part of the time lapse in that folder so

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.100 
part of the time lapse in that folder so
there's<00:03:00.160> only<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.550> time<00:03:00.700> lapse<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.930> works

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
there's only the time lapse it works

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.570 
there's only the time lapse it works
much<00:03:02.230> better<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:02.890> other<00:03:03.070> software

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
much better with this other software

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.650 
much better with this other software
which<00:03:03.670> I'm<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> open<00:03:04.090> right<00:03:04.270> now<00:03:04.300> and

where the time-lapse photos are so I put

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.990

them in a folder called time-lapse you

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.940 
them in a folder called time-lapse you
see<00:03:25.180> those<00:03:25.269> 209<00:03:25.720> images<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.860> will

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
see those 209 images and it will

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.120 
see those 209 images and it will
immediately<00:03:27.160> read<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.850> all<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.239> metadata

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
immediately read in all the metadata

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.100 
immediately read in all the metadata
that's<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.610> you've<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:30.910> written<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.989> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
that's that you've just written to the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.770 
that's that you've just written to the
files<00:03:32.400> from<00:03:33.400> Lightroom<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.660> see

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
files from Lightroom and so you can see

here<00:03:53.380> it'll<00:03:53.530> do<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.950> automatic<00:03:54.810> basic<00:03:55.810> scaling

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
here it'll do it automatic basic scaling

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.080 
here it'll do it automatic basic scaling

some of the advanced features of this
software<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.750> after<00:04:22.990> I've<00:04:23.110> written<00:04:23.560> all<00:04:23.770> these

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810

plant room now I want to go back to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.350 
plant room now I want to go back to
Lightroom<00:04:38.400> just<00:04:39.400> where<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.580> was<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:39.940> just<00:04:40.090> do

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
metadata I want to read meta data from

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.730 
metadata I want to read meta data from
files<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.120> read<00:04:43.389> all<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.810> data<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.440> just

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
files and read all that data that I just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.939 
files and read all that data that I just
and<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:46.360> says<00:04:46.600> yes<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.320> will<00:04:47.380> overwrite<00:04:47.770> the

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
and it says yes it will overwrite the

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.530 
and it says yes it will overwrite the
stuff<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.520> Lightroom<00:04:48.880> now<00:04:49.000> read<00:04:49.389> it

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
stuff that's in Lightroom now read it

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.159 
stuff that's in Lightroom now read it
and<00:04:50.229> it'll<00:04:50.760> overwrite<00:04:51.760> all<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.150> data<00:04:52.930> with

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
and it'll overwrite all that data with

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.080 
and it'll overwrite all that data with
what<00:04:53.350> I've<00:04:53.440> just<00:04:53.470> created<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:54.160> LR<00:04:54.910> time-lapse

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
what I've just created in LR time-lapse

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.290 
what I've just created in LR time-lapse
and<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.590> result<00:04:56.950> will<00:04:57.100> be<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.820> smooth

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
and the result will be a smooth

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.990 
and the result will be a smooth
transition<00:04:58.780> from<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.550> first<00:05:00.550> image<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
transition from the first image to the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.460 
transition from the first image to the
last<00:05:01.270> one<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:08.080> will<00:05:08.169> kind<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.410> look

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
last one so that it will kind of look

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.610 
last one so that it will kind of look
more<00:05:09.070> smooth<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.700> if<00:05:10.419> I<00:05:10.600> select<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.470> very

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
more smooth so if I select the very

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.550 
more smooth so if I select the very
first<00:05:11.860> image<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.729> start<00:05:13.229> kind<00:05:14.229> of<00:05:14.350> going

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
first image and I start kind of going

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.320 
first image and I start kind of going
forward<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:15.039> can<00:05:15.130> see<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.400> it's<00:05:16.060> hard<00:05:16.240> to

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
forward you can see that it's hard to

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
forward you can see that it's hard to
see<00:05:16.479> in<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.660> but<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.139> crop<00:05:17.889> will<00:05:18.100> slowly

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
see in this but the crop will slowly

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.810 
see in this but the crop will slowly
change<00:05:19.560> still<00:05:20.560> loading<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.949> files<00:05:21.160> just<00:05:21.699> give

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
change still loading the files just give

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.690 
change still loading the files just give
it<00:05:21.850> one<00:05:21.940> second<00:05:22.389> here<00:05:22.539> I<00:05:22.979> go<00:05:23.979> somewhere<00:05:24.340> so

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
it one second here I go somewhere so

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.920 
it one second here I go somewhere so
that's<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:24.940> very<00:05:25.090> first<00:05:25.150> image<00:05:25.630> if<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.780> go

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
that's the very first image if I go

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.350 
that's the very first image if I go
somewhere<00:05:26.169> in<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.380> middle<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.740> sequence

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
somewhere in the middle of the sequence

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.640 
somewhere in the middle of the sequence
you<00:05:28.360> can<00:05:28.389> see<00:05:28.660> it'll<00:05:28.960> become<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.260> half<00:05:29.470> way

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
you can see it'll become a half way

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.860 
you can see it'll become a half way
between<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:30.310> one<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:31.180> end<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:31.690> there

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
between that one and the end so there

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.629 
between that one and the end so there
you<00:05:32.020> go<00:05:32.050> there's<00:05:32.590> that<00:05:32.830> one<00:05:33.340> right<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.610> the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
you go there's that one right in the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.540 
you go there's that one right in the
middle<00:05:33.820> if<00:05:34.539> I<00:05:34.660> go<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.960> end<00:05:35.400> there's<00:05:36.400> the

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
middle if I go to the end there's the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.890 
middle if I go to the end there's the
cropping<00:05:36.789> where<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.150> looks<00:05:37.330> quite<00:05:37.870> different

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
cropping where it looks quite different

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.719 
cropping where it looks quite different
so<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.950> next<00:05:39.039> thing<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.250> want<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.430> do<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.550> I<00:05:39.700> want

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
so the next thing I want to do is I want

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.730 
so the next thing I want to do is I want
to<00:05:39.880> have<00:05:40.450> all<00:05:40.599> these<00:05:40.720> images<00:05:41.110> selected<00:05:41.260> still

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
to have all these images selected still

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.800 
to have all these images selected still
in<00:05:41.889> it<00:05:42.010> export<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:43.300> I'm<00:05:43.389> going<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.570> export

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
in it export and I'm going to export

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.560 
in it export and I'm going to export
these<00:05:43.960> to<00:05:44.139> jpeg<00:05:44.500> images<00:05:44.889> I<00:05:45.180> like<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.300> rename

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
these to jpeg images I like to rename

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.240 
these to jpeg images I like to rename
them<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:47.229> in<00:05:47.349> a<00:05:47.440> sequence<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:47.979> makes<00:05:48.130> it

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
them just in a sequence it makes it

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.629 
them just in a sequence it makes it
easier<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.690> identify<00:05:49.690> them<00:05:50.080> later<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.639> calm

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
easier to identify them later so calm

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.190 
easier to identify them later so calm
sparks<00:05:52.150> because<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.510> called<00:05:52.660> sparks<00:05:52.990> lake

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
sparks because it's called sparks lake

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.460 
sparks because it's called sparks lake
this<00:05:53.740> is<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.930> you<00:05:55.930> want<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.169> width<00:05:56.349> and

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
this is and you want the width and

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.370 
this is and you want the width and
height<00:05:56.620> settings<00:05:56.979> to<00:05:57.130> be<00:05:57.250> set<00:05:57.520> for<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:57.970> 74<00:05:58.750> 1080p

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
height settings to be set for I 74 1080p

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.879 
height settings to be set for I 74 1080p
which<00:05:59.650> is<00:05:59.800> 1920<00:06:00.520> x<00:06:00.639> 1280<00:06:00.970> pixels<00:06:01.770> I'm<00:06:02.770> probably

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
which is 1920 x 1280 pixels I'm probably

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.310 
which is 1920 x 1280 pixels I'm probably
going<00:06:03.160> to<00:06:03.250> scale<00:06:03.430> this<00:06:03.610> down<00:06:03.669> at<00:06:04.000> a<00:06:04.030> 720p<00:06:04.660> video

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
going to scale this down at a 720p video

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.710 
going to scale this down at a 720p video
later<00:06:05.680> but<00:06:05.979> this<00:06:06.550> gives<00:06:06.700> me<00:06:06.849> some<00:06:07.060> flexibility

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
later but this gives me some flexibility

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.230 
later but this gives me some flexibility
if<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.990> want<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.470> make<00:06:08.770> like<00:06:09.220> a<00:06:09.250> blu-ray<00:06:09.610> disc<00:06:09.849> of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
if I want to make like a blu-ray disc of

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.940 
if I want to make like a blu-ray disc of
them<00:06:10.330> later<00:06:10.510> and<00:06:11.229> that's<00:06:11.349> pretty<00:06:11.470> much<00:06:11.590> it<00:06:11.680> you

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
them later and that's pretty much it you

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.350 
them later and that's pretty much it you
just<00:06:12.070> hit<00:06:12.250> export<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.849> then<00:06:12.940> you'll<00:06:13.060> wind<00:06:13.270> up

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
just hit export and then you'll wind up

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.600 
just hit export and then you'll wind up
with<00:06:13.479> a<00:06:13.510> sequence<00:06:13.960> of<00:06:14.580> sequentially<00:06:15.580> numbered

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
with a sequence of sequentially numbered

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.400 
with a sequence of sequentially numbered
files<00:06:16.120> that<00:06:16.419> are<00:06:16.479> each<00:06:16.660> slightly<00:06:17.139> different

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
files that are each slightly different

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.620 
files that are each slightly different
than<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.620> one<00:06:17.800> previous<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.220> it<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:19.360> I'll<00:06:19.510> go

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
than the one previous to it and I'll go

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.320 
than the one previous to it and I'll go
on<00:06:19.720> to<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.900> next<00:06:19.930> video
