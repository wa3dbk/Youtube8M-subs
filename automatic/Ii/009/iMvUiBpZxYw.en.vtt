00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
but it was really cool and i like it and
it<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> free<00:01:01.379> block<00:01:01.620> swapper<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it was a free block swapper which is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560

saying i actually haven't seen before
now<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> wouldn't<00:01:04.199> surprise<00:01:04.409> me<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:05.010> these

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
now it wouldn't surprise me if these

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
now it wouldn't surprise me if these
things<00:01:05.760> already<00:01:06.270> exist<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.470> i<00:01:07.530> thought<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
things already exist but i thought it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you can see it swaps between the three

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
you can see it swaps between the three
different<00:01:12.030> blocks<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.630> knew<00:01:12.810> someone<00:01:13.080> my

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
compacted it and I was completely amazed
at<00:01:24.900> how<00:01:25.049> much<00:01:25.259> he<00:01:25.439> managed<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> compact<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
at how much he managed to compact it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.429 
at how much he managed to compact it
down<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> design<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> saw

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
down so this was the design that we saw

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
down so this was the design that we saw
in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> beginning<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> video<00:01:29.549> he<00:01:29.790> made

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
in the beginning of the video he made

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
in the beginning of the video he made
this<00:01:30.119> literally<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.869> minutes<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.409> looked<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this literally in minutes I looked at I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.350 
this literally in minutes I looked at I
thought<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.579> amazing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
thought that's amazing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.420 
thought that's amazing
I<00:01:33.390> want<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.869> give<00:01:33.960> JB<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> challenge<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.250> said

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I want to give JB a challenge and I said

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.770 
I want to give JB a challenge and I said
can<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> make<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.970> bigger<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
can you make this bigger can you make it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.490 
can you make this bigger can you make it
do<00:01:36.900> 4<00:01:37.200> 5<00:01:37.770> 6<00:01:38.189> etc<00:01:38.430> etc<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.540> over<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
do 4 5 6 etc etc and over here you can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
do 4 5 6 etc etc and over here you can
see<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.950> pretty<00:01:41.070> much<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.640> design

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
see it's pretty much the same design

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
see it's pretty much the same design
except<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> extend<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.770> will

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
except you can extend it and it will

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
except you can extend it and it will
actually<00:01:44.009> swap<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.820> between<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.570> these

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
actually swap it between all of these

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.289 
actually swap it between all of these
blocks<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.590> by<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.610> cycle<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
blocks one by one in a cycle which is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
blocks one by one in a cycle which is
extremely<00:01:48.840> cool<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.560> fly<00:01:49.920> around

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
extremely cool now if we just fly around

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830 
extremely cool now if we just fly around
to<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.909> you'll<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> there's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to the back here you'll see that there's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
to the back here you'll see that there's
a<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> redstone<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.369> extended

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a bit of redstone that can be extended

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
a bit of redstone that can be extended
to<00:01:54.060> control<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> final<00:01:55.049> Pistons<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to control the final Pistons so this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
to control the final Pistons so this
means<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.030> could<00:01:57.240> remove<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.259> these

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
means that you could remove one of these

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
means that you could remove one of these
pieces<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.860> redstone<00:01:59.100> shift<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> back<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> bit

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
pieces of redstone shift it back a bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
pieces of redstone shift it back a bit
and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.630> you'd<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> two<00:02:01.200> less<00:02:01.409> blocks<00:02:01.680> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and then you'd have two less blocks you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.289 
and then you'd have two less blocks you
could<00:02:01.979> also<00:02:02.159> extend<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> couple<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.270> well

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
could also extend it a couple as well

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840 
could also extend it a couple as well
and<00:02:03.659> swap<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.500> lot<00:02:04.890> more<00:02:05.070> blocks<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> thing

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and swap a lot more blocks but the thing

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
and swap a lot more blocks but the thing
with<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.090> design<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
with this design is that it's going to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
with this design is that it's going to
do<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.160> amount<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> blocks<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.420> you've<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:09.690> free

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
do a amount of blocks so you've got free

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930 
do a amount of blocks so you've got free
here<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.700> sort<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
here I think this one is that sort of a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.760 
here I think this one is that sort of a
quick<00:02:12.120> count<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.660> 9<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
quick count is that 9 so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.610 
quick count is that 9 so
be<00:02:13.800> able<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.340> five<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.630> seven<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.230> well

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
be able to do five and and seven as well

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.920 
be able to do five and and seven as well
so<00:02:17.280> then<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> said<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.180> possible<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.690> do<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so then I said is it possible to do it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
so then I said is it possible to do it
with<00:02:19.050> an<00:02:19.140> even<00:02:19.320> amount<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.860> he<00:02:19.920> made<00:02:20.100> this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
with an even amount and he made this

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.820 
with an even amount and he made this
design<00:02:20.730> over<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.590> one

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
design over here so you can see this one

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.070 
design over here so you can see this one
is<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> swap<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.970> between<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> six

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
is going to swap the between is that six

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.630 
is going to swap the between is that six
blocks<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:25.620> not<00:02:26.010> sure<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.490> actually

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
blocks I'm not sure if that can actually

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.730 
blocks I'm not sure if that can actually
be<00:02:26.940> compacted<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.630> four<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> probably<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.530> but

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
be compacted to four it probably can but

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.050 
be compacted to four it probably can but
maybe<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.430> design<00:02:29.820> right<00:02:30.000> here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
maybe not with this design right here

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600 
maybe not with this design right here
and<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> other<00:02:31.740> design<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.130> showed<00:02:32.460> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and like the other design I showed you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.150 
and like the other design I showed you
it<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.850> be<00:02:32.940> extended<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.660> well<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.890> go

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
it can be extended as well so if we go

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.380 
it can be extended as well so if we go
over<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.610> one<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
over to this one you can see it's a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.180 
over to this one you can see it's a
little<00:02:36.510> bit<00:02:36.750> longer<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
little bit longer and that's because I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.950 
little bit longer and that's because I
modified<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.850> redstone<00:02:39.300> around<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> back

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
modified the redstone around the back

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.070 
modified the redstone around the back
here<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:41.130> extended<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.880> once<00:02:42.090> again<00:02:42.300> so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
here and just extended it once again so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.660 
here and just extended it once again so
you<00:02:43.170> could<00:02:43.440> increase<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.860> even<00:02:44.100> further<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
you could increase it even further and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.400 
you could increase it even further and
have<00:02:44.940> even<00:02:45.120> more<00:02:45.300> blocks<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:45.990> block<00:02:46.140> swap

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
have even more blocks in your block swap

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.120 
have even more blocks in your block swap
up<00:02:47.600> now<00:02:48.600> when<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.900> comes<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> tutorial<00:02:49.980> I'm

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
up now when it comes to the tutorial I'm

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.170 
up now when it comes to the tutorial I'm
not<00:02:50.250> going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.460> do<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> block<00:02:50.850> by<00:02:51.030> block

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
not going to do a block by block

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.850 
not going to do a block by block
rebuilding<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.680> see

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
rebuilding at this because you can see

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.230 
rebuilding at this because you can see
everything<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.310> either<00:02:53.700> side<00:02:53.820> these

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
everything from either side these

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.540 
everything from either side these
designs<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.810> basically<00:02:55.260> too<00:02:55.590> deep<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.340> thing

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
designs are basically too deep one thing

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.010 
designs are basically too deep one thing
to<00:02:56.670> point<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:57.000> here<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.660> that's<00:02:57.810> a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
to point out here is that that's a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.750 
to point out here is that that's a
sticky<00:02:58.320> piston<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.370> one<00:02:59.610> though

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
sticky piston and so is this one though

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.820 
sticky piston and so is this one though
the<00:02:59.880> only<00:03:00.180> sticky<00:03:00.480> pistons<00:03:00.870> being<00:03:01.110> used<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the only sticky pistons being used so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.200 
the only sticky pistons being used so
you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.160> everything<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.820> need<00:03:03.030> in

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
you can see everything that you need in

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.180 
you can see everything that you need in
this<00:03:03.420> layer<00:03:03.690> now<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> input<00:03:04.800> is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this layer now this is the input is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.890 
this layer now this is the input is
simply<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> repeater<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.090> points<00:03:06.450> into<00:03:06.720> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
simply a repeater that points into this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660 
simply a repeater that points into this
block<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.710> could<00:03:07.860> do<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.130> from<00:03:08.370> anywhere

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
block so you could do that from anywhere

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.280 
block so you could do that from anywhere
and<00:03:08.880> wire<00:03:09.120> up<00:03:09.330> your<00:03:09.450> input<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.990> different

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and wire up your input in a different

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.990 
and wire up your input in a different
place<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.950> if<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.160> fly<00:03:11.370> around<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:11.940> side

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
place but if we fly around to this side

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.610 
place but if we fly around to this side
you<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.480> where<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.840> redstone<00:03:13.200> torches

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you can see where the redstone torches

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
you can see where the redstone torches
go<00:03:13.890> there's<00:03:14.310> also<00:03:14.520> one<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> end<00:03:15.330> over<00:03:15.540> here

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
go there's also one on the end over here

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.420 
go there's also one on the end over here
that's<00:03:16.020> not<00:03:16.200> powered<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.740> moment<00:03:17.070> then

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
that's not powered at the moment then

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
that's not powered at the moment then
you've<00:03:17.550> got<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> repeater<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.270> third

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
you've got a repeater on the third

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
you've got a repeater on the third
setting<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.410> repeater<00:03:19.740> on<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> second<00:03:20.490> so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
setting and a repeater on the second so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.730 
setting and a repeater on the second so
if<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.240> over<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.810> version<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
if we go over to this version of the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.530 
if we go over to this version of the
contraption<00:03:23.370> right<00:03:23.400> here<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.360> same

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
contraption right here it's the same

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.210 
contraption right here it's the same
deal<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.990> sticky<00:03:25.290> pistons<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:25.920> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
deal with the sticky pistons it's this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
deal with the sticky pistons it's this
one<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.670> also<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.570> one<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.990> is<00:03:28.080> sticky<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
one and also this one that is sticky and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
one and also this one that is sticky and
then<00:03:29.100> when<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.520> around<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.060> back<00:03:30.240> you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
then when we go around to the back you

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.030 
then when we go around to the back you
can<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.230> wiring<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.680> pretty<00:03:31.890> much

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
can see that the wiring is pretty much

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.860 
can see that the wiring is pretty much
the<00:03:32.220> same<00:03:32.400> except<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.330> block<00:03:33.600> right<00:03:33.810> here

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the same except this block right here

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.600 
the same except this block right here
extends<00:03:34.680> we<00:03:34.830> have<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.010> couple<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.310> pieces<00:03:35.430> of

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
extends we have a couple of pieces of

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.699 
extends we have a couple of pieces of
redstone<00:03:35.910> over<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> another<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.080> with<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
redstone over to another one with the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.490 
redstone over to another one with the
torch<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.190> back<00:03:38.870> when<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.959> comes<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.380> this

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
torch on the back when it comes to this

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380 
torch on the back when it comes to this
side<00:03:40.740> there<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.160> little<00:03:41.490> bit<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.910> going<00:03:42.120> on

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
side there is a little bit more going on

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.030 
side there is a little bit more going on
but<00:03:42.660> they're<00:03:42.810> all<00:03:42.930> normal<00:03:43.110> Pistons<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.890> only

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
but they're all normal Pistons the only

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.590 
but they're all normal Pistons the only
one<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:44.340> sticky<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.209> right<00:03:45.360> here

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
one that's sticky is this one right here

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.240 
one that's sticky is this one right here
and<00:03:45.630> don't<00:03:45.959> forget<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.440> got<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> furnace<00:03:47.070> over

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and don't forget you got a furnace over

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
and don't forget you got a furnace over
here<00:03:47.550> as<00:03:47.670> well<00:03:47.850> which<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.030> important<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.200> when

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
here as well which is important so when

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.810 
here as well which is important so when
it<00:03:49.410> comes<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.890> input<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.550> need<00:03:50.700> to

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
it comes to the input we just need to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.400 
it comes to the input we just need to
power<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.240> block<00:03:51.510> right<00:03:51.540> here<00:03:51.750> with<00:03:52.200> a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
power this block right here with a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.170 
power this block right here with a
repeater<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.160> could<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.610> from

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
repeater so you could do that from

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.449 
repeater so you could do that from
somewhere<00:03:54.630> else<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.020> then<00:03:55.500> there<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.070> torch

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
somewhere else and then there is a torch

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.130 
somewhere else and then there is a torch
on<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.700> side<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.240> see<00:03:57.300> redstone<00:03:57.870> below

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
on the side you can see redstone below

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.230 
on the side you can see redstone below
repeater<00:03:58.500> redstone<00:03:58.740> repeater<00:03:59.310> both<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.180> those

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
repeater redstone repeater both of those

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.820 
repeater redstone repeater both of those
on<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.510> default<00:04:00.840> settings<00:04:01.260> then<00:04:01.440> over<00:04:01.709> on

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
on the default settings then over on

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.440 
on the default settings then over on
this<00:04:01.980> side<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.850> got<00:04:02.970> two<00:04:03.120> pieces<00:04:03.270> of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
this side and we got two pieces of

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
this side and we got two pieces of
redstone<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.900> two<00:04:04.260> torches<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.070> simply

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
redstone and two torches if you simply

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.040 
redstone and two torches if you simply
rebuild<00:04:05.790> what<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.330> see<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:06.720> then<00:04:06.900> you'll

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
rebuild what you see there then you'll

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.140 
rebuild what you see there then you'll
be<00:04:07.170> able<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.620> recreate<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:08.430> then<00:04:08.940> when<00:04:09.060> it

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
be able to recreate this then when it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.940 
be able to recreate this then when it
comes<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.510> extending<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:10.350> just<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.739> bit

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
comes to extending it it's just this bit

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.310 
comes to extending it it's just this bit
of<00:04:11.040> redstone<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.700> between<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.810> two<00:04:12.989> repeaters

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
of redstone in between the two repeaters

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.960 
of redstone in between the two repeaters
that<00:04:13.650> needs<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.130> extended<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:14.850> that

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
that needs to be extended and that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.490 
that needs to be extended and that
doesn't<00:04:15.330> really<00:04:15.450> affect<00:04:15.840> anything<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
doesn't really affect anything on the

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.470 
doesn't really affect anything on the
front<00:04:16.620> side<00:04:16.980> however<00:04:17.730> you'll<00:04:17.910> notice<00:04:18.239> that

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
front side however you'll notice that

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.849 
front side however you'll notice that
these<00:04:18.660> pistons<00:04:19.080> are<00:04:19.230> not<00:04:19.350> actually<00:04:19.680> together

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
these pistons are not actually together

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.740 
these pistons are not actually together
this<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.489> where<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.790> contraction<00:04:21.299> gets<00:04:21.480> split

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
this is where the contraction gets split

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.780 
this is where the contraction gets split
so<00:04:22.290> this<00:04:22.710> piston<00:04:23.130> right<00:04:23.280> here<00:04:23.460> needs<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.729> be

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
so this piston right here needs to be

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.870 
so this piston right here needs to be
one<00:04:24.060> block<00:04:24.240> away<00:04:24.270> from<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:25.640> so<00:04:26.640> that's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
one block away from that one so that's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.610 
one block away from that one so that's
how<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.060> build<00:04:27.180> them

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
how you build them

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.469 
how you build them
