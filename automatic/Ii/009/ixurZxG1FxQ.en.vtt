hey guys Harmon here and in this

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.770 
hey guys Harmon here and in this
tutorial<00:00:02.220> I'm<00:00:02.639> basically<00:00:03.210> showing<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.600> how

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
tutorial I'm basically showing you how

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.070 
tutorial I'm basically showing you how
to<00:00:03.840> upload<00:00:04.170> your<00:00:04.319> 60fps<00:00:05.130> video<00:00:05.750> and<00:00:06.750> make<00:00:07.049> it

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
to upload your 60fps video and make it

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.700 
to upload your 60fps video and make it
60fps<00:00:07.890> using<00:00:08.309> Windows<00:00:08.610> Live<00:00:08.820> Movie<00:00:09.030> Maker

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
60fps using Windows Live Movie Maker

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110 
60fps using Windows Live Movie Maker
normally<00:00:10.710> when<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.160> 60fps<00:00:11.580> video

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
normally when you have a 60fps video

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120 
normally when you have a 60fps video
what<00:00:12.480> normal<00:00:12.870> people<00:00:13.200> will<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.950> they'll

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
what normal people will do is they'll

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.880 
what normal people will do is they'll
hit<00:00:14.309> file<00:00:14.610> save<00:00:14.790> movie<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.619> for

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
hit file save movie and then for

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
hit file save movie and then for
high-definition<00:00:17.670> display<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.930> doesn't

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
high-definition display but it doesn't

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
high-definition display but it doesn't
determine<00:00:19.980> whether<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.400> your<00:00:20.609> videos

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
determine whether or not your videos

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.630 
determine whether or not your videos
60fps<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> could<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.439> 60fps<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> would

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
60fps so it could be 60fps but it would

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.990 
60fps so it could be 60fps but it would
come<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.660> 30fps<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> do

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
come out as 30fps so what you want to do

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
come out as 30fps so what you want to do
is<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.660> want<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> create<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> custom<00:00:28.500> setting

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
is you want to create a custom setting

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
is you want to create a custom setting
and<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.090> create<00:00:30.359> custom

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and you want to go down to create custom

video but you can have any name you want
now<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> video<00:00:41.340> settings<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
now for the video settings for what you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.470 
now for the video settings for what you
want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.190> 1920<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.760> height<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
want to have 1920 for height you want to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
want to have 1920 for height you want to
have<00:00:45.649> 1080<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.739> need<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> worry

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
have 1080 you don't really need to worry

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.330 
have 1080 you don't really need to worry
about<00:00:50.340> bitrate<00:00:51.170> but<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.379> framerate<00:00:52.680> there's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
about bitrate but for framerate there's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.709 
about bitrate but for framerate there's
two<00:00:53.579> options<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.660> have

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
two options you could have you can have

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.819 
two options you could have you can have
60<00:00:55.320> um<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:59.629> 59.94<00:01:00.829> now

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
60 um and then you can have 59.94 now

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
60 um and then you can have 59.94 now
the<00:01:01.890> reason<00:01:02.280> why<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> say<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the reason why I say you can use two is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
the reason why I say you can use two is
because<00:01:04.110> some<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.500> who<00:01:04.979> type<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.430> 60fps<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
because some people who type in 60fps on

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
because some people who type in 60fps on
the<00:01:06.750> framerate<00:01:07.020> say<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.280> work

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the framerate say that it doesn't work

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
the framerate say that it doesn't work
for<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> doesn't<00:01:09.750> work<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
for them so if it doesn't work for you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.429 
for them so if it doesn't work for you
that<00:01:11.060> 59.94<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> good<00:01:12.810> alternative

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that 59.94 will be a good alternative

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
that 59.94 will be a good alternative
for<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.280> come<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.640> 60fps

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
for you and it will come out as 60fps

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
for you and it will come out as 60fps
regardless<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.950> audio<00:01:17.220> settings<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
regardless now for audio settings I just

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
regardless now for audio settings I just
put<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.860> highest<00:01:19.860> quality<00:01:21.200> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.259> worry

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
put the highest quality if you worry

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
put the highest quality if you worry
about<00:01:22.710> file<00:01:23.189> size<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.939> make<00:01:24.180> sure<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> see

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
about file size just make sure you see

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
about file size just make sure you see
this<00:01:24.990> down<00:01:25.259> below<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> hit<00:01:26.310> save<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
this down below and hit save to have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
this down below and hit save to have
your<00:01:27.240> custom<00:01:27.689> setting<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.920> save

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
your custom setting and then just save

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
your custom setting and then just save
it<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.520> something<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.299> example<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:30.750> just

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it over something for example I'm just

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.280 
it over something for example I'm just
going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:32.810> then<00:01:33.810> after<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
going to use this one then after you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.710 
going to use this one then after you
save<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.950> basically<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> nor<00:01:36.299> render

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
save it you basically want to nor render

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.230 
save it you basically want to nor render
it<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> normally<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> file<00:01:38.280> save

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it like you normally do go to file save

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.240 
it like you normally do go to file save
movie<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.229> should<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.770> recent

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
movie and you should see on recent

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
movie and you should see on recent
settings<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> should<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.290> custom

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
settings you should see your custom

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
settings you should see your custom
thing<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.310> example<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.570> mine<00:01:45.869> right

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
thing for example this is mine right

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.460 
thing for example this is mine right
here<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.509> doing<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.810> step<00:01:49.049> by<00:01:49.200> step

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
here so if you're doing a step by step

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
here so if you're doing a step by step
and<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.770> basically<00:01:50.189> trying<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> render

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and you're basically trying to render

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.670 
and you're basically trying to render
right<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:51.990> end<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.259> clicking

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
right now you can just end up clicking

60<00:03:03.019> fps<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:04.370> just<00:03:04.820> take<00:03:05.030> note<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.570> does

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
60 fps now just take note that it does

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.270 
60 fps now just take note that it does
take<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.959> long<00:03:06.200> time<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.590> process<00:03:07.040> when<00:03:07.160> you

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
take a long time to process when you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.360 
take a long time to process when you
upload<00:03:07.549> 60<00:03:07.970> FPS<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.959> if<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.140> quality<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.650> 720p

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
upload 60 FPS so if the quality is 720p

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360 
upload 60 FPS so if the quality is 720p
and<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.760> doesn't<00:03:11.030> say<00:03:11.150> 60<00:03:11.570> fps<00:03:11.989> just<00:03:12.680> know<00:03:12.920> that

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and it doesn't say 60 fps just know that

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.250 
and it doesn't say 60 fps just know that
if<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:13.670> give<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:14.000> few<00:03:14.239> hours<00:03:14.269> then<00:03:15.079> of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
if you give it a few hours then of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.979 
if you give it a few hours then of
course<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.799> won't<00:03:16.310> lend<00:03:16.549> up<00:03:16.700> showing<00:03:17.000> 60<00:03:17.600> fps

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989
