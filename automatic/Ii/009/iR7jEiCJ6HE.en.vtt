to talk a little bit how to connect the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.630 
to talk a little bit how to connect the
EQ<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.439> EQ<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.750> mixer<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.039> EQ

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
EQ this EQ in this mixer so that the EQ

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.109 
EQ this EQ in this mixer so that the EQ
is<00:00:24.420> responsible<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.740> several<00:00:26.550> microphones

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
is responsible for several microphones

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
is responsible for several microphones
or<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> case<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> take<00:00:29.130> all

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
or actually in this case we can take all

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.470 
or actually in this case we can take all
the<00:00:29.699> microphones<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.740> um<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> connect

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the microphones and so um how to connect

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
the microphones and so um how to connect
the<00:00:35.300> EQ<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> aux<00:00:37.980> channel<00:00:38.579> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the EQ actually to the aux channel so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
the EQ actually to the aux channel so
we're<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> start<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.800> to

that<00:02:29.320> everything<00:02:29.770> goes<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.100> aux<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.610> can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that everything goes to aux and you can

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.690 
that everything goes to aux and you can
put<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.210> microphones<00:02:32.370> exactly<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> same

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
put all the microphones exactly the same

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300 
put all the microphones exactly the same
and<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.870> want<00:02:35.080> for<00:02:35.380> some<00:02:35.560> reason<00:02:35.950> one<00:02:36.280> of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and if you want for some reason one of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.400 
and if you want for some reason one of
the<00:02:36.580> microphones<00:02:36.970> don't<00:02:37.480> going<00:02:37.990> through<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
the microphones don't going through the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
the microphones don't going through the
EQ<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:40.320> pull<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.860> aux<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.240> push

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
EQ just pull down the aux and just push

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.960 
EQ just pull down the aux and just push
out<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.200> Maine<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.590> will<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.550> straight

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
out of Maine and that will go straight

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.340 
out of Maine and that will go straight
through<00:02:46.090> automate<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.810> say<00:02:50.050> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
through automate so and that is say a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.520 
through automate so and that is say a
feature<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.490> what<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.850> can<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.960> you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
feature not on what you can do and you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.630 
feature not on what you can do and you
can<00:02:53.770> all<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.790> do<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:56.020> can<00:02:56.200> do<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.530> aux<00:02:56.800> one

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
can all so do a you can do the aux one

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.000 
can all so do a you can do the aux one
also<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.150> EQ<00:03:02.050> has<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.800> a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
also so you see this EQ has it's a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.600 
also so you see this EQ has it's a
double<00:03:03.490> EQ<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.480> two<00:03:04.720> channels<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
double EQ it's the two channels it's a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.160 
double EQ it's the two channels it's a
15<00:03:06.970> band<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.140> not<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:09.610> accurate<00:03:10.170> but

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
15 band so it's not that accurate but

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.420 
15 band so it's not that accurate but
for<00:03:11.410> example<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.190> -<00:03:12.630> mic<00:03:13.630> 1<00:03:14.140> &amp;<00:03:14.350> 2<00:03:14.560> goes<00:03:15.400> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
for example you can - mic 1 &amp; 2 goes to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.370 
for example you can - mic 1 &amp; 2 goes to
aux<00:03:16.000> 1<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.959> goes<00:03:17.350> out<00:03:17.709> from<00:03:18.310> aux<00:03:18.670> 1<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
aux 1 and goes out from aux 1 to the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.020 
aux 1 and goes out from aux 1 to the
first<00:03:20.830> EQ<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.490> back<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.450> line<00:03:22.900> 1<00:03:23.350> or<00:03:24.010> line<00:03:24.250> 9<00:03:24.850> to

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
first EQ and back to line 1 or line 9 to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.280 
first EQ and back to line 1 or line 9 to
10<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.530> then<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.860> have<00:03:27.190> one<00:03:27.610> channel<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
10 and then you have one channel for the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.320 
10 and then you have one channel for the
first<00:03:29.320> two<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.830> then<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.459> can<00:03:30.700> take<00:03:30.940> three

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
first two and then you can take three

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.800 
first two and then you can take three
four<00:03:31.660> five<00:03:31.720> six<00:03:32.320> seven<00:03:32.620> eight<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.630> push<00:03:34.630> them

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
four five six seven eight and push them

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.730 
four five six seven eight and push them
to<00:03:35.140> aux<00:03:35.950> 2<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.550> goes<00:03:37.300> aux<00:03:37.570> 2<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.590> other

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
to aux 2 and goes aux 2 in to the other

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.370 
to aux 2 and goes aux 2 in to the other
EQ<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.290> goes<00:03:41.290> back<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.970> let's<00:03:42.970> say<00:03:43.150> line<00:03:43.480> 11

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
EQ and goes back to let's say line 11

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.400 
EQ and goes back to let's say line 11
and<00:03:44.470> 12<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.890> then<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.520> have<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:46.230> master<00:03:47.230> fader

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
and 12 and then you have a master fader

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.600 
and 12 and then you have a master fader
for<00:03:48.010> all<00:03:48.310> those<00:03:48.610> microphones<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.550> a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
for all those microphones and you have a

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.449 
for all those microphones and you have a
separate<00:03:51.940> EQ<00:03:52.390> for<00:03:52.870> those<00:03:53.620> microphones<00:03:54.010> also

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
separate EQ for those microphones also

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.510 
separate EQ for those microphones also
and<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:55.090> course<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.780> always<00:03:55.959> use<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:57.010> EQ

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
and of course you can always use the EQ

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.360 
and of course you can always use the EQ
on<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.480> separate<00:03:58.810> mics<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.320> also<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.160> fader

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
on the separate mics and also the fader

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.510 
on the separate mics and also the fader
on<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.000> separate<00:04:01.480> microphones<00:04:02.400> what<00:04:03.400> you

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
on the separate microphones what you

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.460 
on the separate microphones what you
have<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.790> be<00:04:03.880> careful<00:04:04.360> about<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.020> you

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
have to be careful about is that you

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.449 
have to be careful about is that you
don't<00:04:05.739> have<00:04:06.580> any<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.270> these<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.980> ones<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.340> go

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
don't have any of these the ones that go

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.970 
don't have any of these the ones that go
through<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.880> EQ<00:04:10.300> also<00:04:11.080> through<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.440> subgroup

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
through the EQ also through a subgroup

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.930 
through the EQ also through a subgroup
or<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.310> main<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:15.220> pre<00:04:15.670> fader

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
or the main and and that the pre fader

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.599 
or the main and and that the pre fader
button<00:04:16.690> isn't<00:04:16.930> pushed<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.620> because<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.040> can

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
button isn't pushed in because that can

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.570 
button isn't pushed in because that can
make<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:19.299> bit<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.989> problems<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.220> um

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
make a bit of a problems so um

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.070 
make a bit of a problems so um
yeah<00:04:22.939> that<00:04:23.479> is<00:04:23.629> how<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:23.900> connect<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:25.599> an<00:04:26.599> EQ

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
yeah that is how you connect the an EQ

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.520 
yeah that is how you connect the an EQ
to<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:28.360> this<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.419> an<00:04:29.720> aberrant<00:04:30.169> it's<00:04:30.740> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
to a this is an aberrant it's the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.320 
to a this is an aberrant it's the
simplest<00:04:33.530> one<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.099> FB<00:04:34.819> q<00:04:35.120> 1502<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.919> um<00:04:37.580> and

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
simplest one is the FB q 1502 so um and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.619 
simplest one is the FB q 1502 so um and
it's<00:04:38.810> an<00:04:39.050> yeah<00:04:39.800> it's<00:04:40.069> as<00:04:40.250> an<00:04:40.520> X<00:04:40.669> board<00:04:40.909> so<00:04:41.449> it's

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
it's an yeah it's as an X board so it's

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.149 
it's an yeah it's as an X board so it's
all<00:04:41.810> behringer<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.009> how<00:04:43.099> you

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
all behringer and this is how you

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.730 
all behringer and this is how you
connect<00:04:43.490> them<00:04:43.719> or<00:04:44.719> can<00:04:45.080> connect<00:04:45.379> them<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.590> can

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
connect them or can connect them you can

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.320 
connect them or can connect them you can
connect<00:04:46.009> them<00:04:46.129> in<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.580> lot<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:46.759> ways<00:04:46.969> but<00:04:47.210> this

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
connect them in a lot of ways but this

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.939 
connect them in a lot of ways but this
is<00:04:47.509> one<00:04:47.780> way<00:04:48.129> okay<00:04:49.129> thanks<00:04:49.789> bye
