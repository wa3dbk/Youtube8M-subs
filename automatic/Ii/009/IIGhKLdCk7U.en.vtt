00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.770 

okay<00:00:07.100> here<00:00:07.370> we<00:00:07.490> have<00:00:07.520> a<00:00:07.670> look<00:00:07.970> at<00:00:08.149> the<00:00:08.300> furnace

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
okay here we have a look at the furnace

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.060 
okay here we have a look at the furnace
and<00:00:09.490> we're<00:00:10.490> looking<00:00:10.820> for<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.150> transformer<00:00:12.080> in

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
and we're looking for the transformer in

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.330 
and we're looking for the transformer in
this<00:00:13.429> case<00:00:14.980> there<00:00:15.980> it<00:00:16.369> is<00:00:16.610> right<00:00:17.270> there

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
this case there it is right there

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.190 
this case there it is right there
these<00:00:19.340> things<00:00:19.640> can<00:00:19.880> be<00:00:20.029> located<00:00:20.480> various

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
these things can be located various

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.970 
these things can be located various
places<00:00:21.650> but<00:00:22.240> you<00:00:23.240> are<00:00:23.750> looking<00:00:24.050> for<00:00:24.560> something

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
places but you are looking for something

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.140 
places but you are looking for something
like<00:00:26.260> that<00:00:27.260> now<00:00:27.859> that's<00:00:28.130> on<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.519> side<00:00:28.820> of<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
like that now that's on the side of the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.200 
like that now that's on the side of the
IFC<00:00:29.510> in<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:30.230> one<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:31.460> these<00:00:31.640> are<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.970> wires

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
IFC in this one and these are the wires

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.950 
IFC in this one and these are the wires
we're<00:00:32.689> going<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.900> need<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.230> deal<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:34.960> okay

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
we're going to need to deal with okay

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.710 
we're going to need to deal with okay
here<00:00:36.650> I'm<00:00:36.860> depressing<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.790> door<00:00:38.030> switch<00:00:38.449> with

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
here I'm depressing the door switch with

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.930 
here I'm depressing the door switch with
my<00:00:38.870> thumb<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:40.190> if<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.460> look<00:00:40.670> down<00:00:40.699> below

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
my thumb and if you look down below

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.460 
my thumb and if you look down below
you'll<00:00:41.600> see<00:00:41.690> blinking<00:00:42.379> light

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.439 

there<00:00:46.100> are<00:00:46.220> several<00:00:46.460> blinking<00:00:46.970> lights<00:00:47.210> on

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
there are several blinking lights on

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.619 
there are several blinking lights on
this<00:00:47.659> machine<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.339> that's<00:00:49.339> telling<00:00:49.879> you<00:00:50.059> if

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
this machine but that's telling you if

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.600 
this machine but that's telling you if
those<00:00:50.900> lights<00:00:51.260> any<00:00:51.619> lights<00:00:51.920> are<00:00:52.129> on<00:00:52.159> down

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
those lights any lights are on down

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.350 
those lights any lights are on down
there<00:00:52.909> your<00:00:53.780> 24<00:00:54.470> volt<00:00:54.769> is<00:00:55.519> working<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.299> course

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
there your 24 volt is working of course

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.899 
there your 24 volt is working of course
in<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:56.839> case<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.110> fan<00:00:57.500> has<00:00:57.769> started<00:00:58.190> up<00:00:58.339> so<00:00:58.400> I

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
in this case a fan has started up so I

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.039 
in this case a fan has started up so I
know<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:01.100> working<00:01:01.449> however<00:01:02.449> if<00:01:02.659> I<00:01:02.839> had

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
know it's working however if I had

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.250 
know it's working however if I had
nothing<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:03.650> all<00:01:03.830> down<00:01:04.159> there<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:05.330> means<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
nothing at all down there that means I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.560 
nothing at all down there that means I
don't<00:01:06.320> have<00:01:06.619> 24<00:01:07.369> volts<00:01:07.760> also<00:01:07.939> could<00:01:08.270> mean<00:01:08.450> I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
don't have 24 volts also could mean I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.610 
don't have 24 volts also could mean I
don't<00:01:08.630> have<00:01:08.900> hundred<00:01:09.260> ten<00:01:09.530> volts<00:01:11.380> but<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
don't have hundred ten volts but the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.350 
don't have hundred ten volts but the
lights<00:01:12.830> are<00:01:13.010> going<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:13.250> tell<00:01:13.460> me<00:01:13.610> at<00:01:13.730> 24<00:01:14.240> is

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
lights are going to tell me at 24 is

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.440 
lights are going to tell me at 24 is
there<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.640> essentially<00:01:16.640> what<00:01:16.970> I'm<00:01:17.060> trying<00:01:17.330> to

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
there so essentially what I'm trying to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.960 
there so essentially what I'm trying to
do<00:01:17.600> with<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.840> transformer<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.340> I'm<00:01:19.700> going<00:01:19.940> to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
do with the transformer and I'm going to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.440 
do with the transformer and I'm going to
show<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.300> one<00:01:21.010> outside<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.460> machine<00:01:23.120> here

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
show you one outside of the machine here

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.510 
show you one outside of the machine here
right<00:01:23.690> quick<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:25.660> its<00:01:26.660> power<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.380> no<00:01:28.250> power

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
right quick and its power in no power

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.600 
right quick and its power in no power
out<00:01:32.530> okay<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:33.830> I'm<00:01:33.950> showing<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.460> small

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
out okay here I'm showing a small

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.170 
out okay here I'm showing a small
transformer<00:01:35.600> outside<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.130> unit<00:01:37.490> may<00:01:38.000> be<00:01:38.030> a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
transformer outside the unit may be a

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.930 
transformer outside the unit may be a
little<00:01:38.600> easier<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:39.140> tell<00:01:39.380> okay<00:01:40.310> I've<00:01:40.700> got

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
little easier to tell okay I've got

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.970 
little easier to tell okay I've got
probes<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.690> here<00:01:42.050> now<00:01:42.230> I'm<00:01:42.350> not<00:01:42.530> reading<00:01:42.770> any

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
probes in here now I'm not reading any

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.910 
probes in here now I'm not reading any
power<00:01:43.370> in<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.640> probes<00:01:43.940> because<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
power in the probes because this is the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.910 
power in the probes because this is the
power<00:01:46.130> coming<00:01:46.370> in<00:01:47.229> sometimes<00:01:48.229> if<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:48.680> don't

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
power coming in sometimes if you don't

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.250 
power coming in sometimes if you don't
get<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.370> in<00:01:49.580> there<00:01:50.120> far<00:01:50.450> enough<00:01:50.690> they<00:01:51.080> won't

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
get it in there far enough they won't

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.310 
get it in there far enough they won't
show<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.610> very<00:01:52.880> important<00:01:53.570> when<00:01:54.200> you're

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
show this is very important when you're

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.820 
show this is very important when you're
dealing<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:54.680> wire<00:01:55.040> nuts<00:01:56.229> you've<00:01:57.229> got<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.680> get

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
dealing with wire nuts you've got to get

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.230 
dealing with wire nuts you've got to get
them<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.159> there<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.760> they're<00:01:59.030> making

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
them in there so that they're making

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.170 
them in there so that they're making
contact<00:02:00.100> now<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.520> doesn't<00:02:01.760> appear<00:02:02.150> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
contact now this one doesn't appear to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.649 
contact now this one doesn't appear to
be<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.310> going<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.549> loosen<00:02:04.760> this<00:02:05.090> wire<00:02:05.420> nut

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
be so I'm going to loosen this wire nut

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.960 
be so I'm going to loosen this wire nut
a<00:02:05.690> bit<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.700> notice<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.659> just<00:02:08.720> came<00:02:09.170> up

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
a bit now you notice it just came up

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.650 
a bit now you notice it just came up

make sure your contacts if you're using
wire<00:02:14.959> nuts<00:02:14.990> there's<00:02:15.860> wire<00:02:16.069> nuts<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.490> these

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
wire nuts there's wire nuts on these

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.620 
wire nuts there's wire nuts on these
thing<00:02:16.910> make<00:02:17.720> sure

121 okay so there is power coming in so
now<00:02:34.200> we're<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.710> power<00:02:35.040> coming

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
now we're going to look to power coming

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.940 
now we're going to look to power coming
out<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.140> has<00:02:37.320> three<00:02:37.650> terminals

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
out now this one has three terminals

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.380 
out now this one has three terminals
there's<00:02:38.370> only<00:02:38.550> two<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.880> them<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.210> are<00:02:39.360> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
there's only two of them that are really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.520 
there's only two of them that are really
used<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:41.210> okay<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.240> show<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:42.870> voltage<00:02:43.260> coming

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
used here okay I show no voltage coming

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.180 
used here okay I show no voltage coming
out<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.460> problem<00:02:47.820> with<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.240> thing

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
out so there's a problem with this thing

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.510 
out so there's a problem with this thing
voltage<00:02:50.190> coming<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.730> no<00:02:51.180> voltage<00:02:51.570> going<00:02:51.780> out

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
voltage coming in no voltage going out

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.590 
voltage coming in no voltage going out
okay<00:02:53.520> let's<00:02:53.790> find<00:02:53.940> out<00:02:54.180> why<00:02:56.270> now<00:02:57.270> I'm<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
okay let's find out why now I'm going to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640 
okay let's find out why now I'm going to
set<00:02:57.780> my<00:02:57.960> meters<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.530> ohm<00:02:58.710> my<00:02:59.610> meter<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.210> ohms

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
set my meters to ohm my meter to ohms

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.310 
set my meters to ohm my meter to ohms
and<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.940> disconnected<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.720> power<00:03:03.990> from

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
and I have disconnected all power from

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.600 
and I have disconnected all power from
this<00:03:04.410> unit<00:03:05.510> using<00:03:06.510> o<00:03:06.690> meter<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.370> only

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
this unit using o meter you not only

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.360 
this unit using o meter you not only
have<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.090> disconnect<00:03:09.900> power<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
have to disconnect power you have to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.720 
have to disconnect power you have to
disconnect<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.450> entire<00:03:13.010> circuit<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.520> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
disconnect the entire circuit going to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550 
disconnect the entire circuit going to
it<00:03:14.850> otherwise<00:03:15.690> you're<00:03:15.900> going<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.080> get<00:03:16.200> bleed

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it otherwise you're going to get bleed

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.420 
it otherwise you're going to get bleed
backs<00:03:16.860> through<00:03:17.850> loads<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.870> light<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> if

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
backs through loads and the light so if

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.250 
backs through loads and the light so if
you're<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.330> test<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:23.760> ohms<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.960> have

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
you're going to test for ohms you have

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.760 
you're going to test for ohms you have
to<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.800> with<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.400> unit<00:03:26.850> power<00:03:27.300> off<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.050> the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
to do it with the unit power off and the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.080 
to do it with the unit power off and the
unit<00:03:29.100> isolated<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.360> I'm<00:03:30.510> isolated<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:32.090> I've

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
unit isolated so I'm isolated here I've

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.900 
unit isolated so I'm isolated here I've
got<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:34.220> probes<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.550> here<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:38.490> not<00:03:38.670> put

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
got the probes on here and do not put

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.970 
got the probes on here and do not put
your<00:03:39.060> fingers<00:03:39.630> at<00:03:39.870> least<00:03:40.050> both<00:03:40.260> fingers<00:03:40.740> on

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
your fingers at least both fingers on

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.370 
your fingers at least both fingers on
these<00:03:41.430> things<00:03:41.730> they<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.780> read<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.110> false

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
these things they will read a false

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.470 
these things they will read a false
reading<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.220> read<00:03:44.490> mega<00:03:44.820> ohms<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.270> it'll

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
reading and read mega ohms but it'll

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.150 
reading and read mega ohms but it'll
still<00:03:45.690> read<00:03:45.930> reading<00:03:46.230> okay<00:03:46.980> I'm<00:03:47.220> well<00:03:48.920> so<00:03:49.920> that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
still read reading okay I'm well so that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.350 
still read reading okay I'm well so that
means<00:03:50.490> my<00:03:51.150> primary<00:03:52.760> winding<00:03:53.760> that's<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.210> one

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
means my primary winding that's the one

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.800 
means my primary winding that's the one
that<00:03:54.450> got<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.720> 120<00:03:54.930> we're<00:03:55.410> stepping<00:03:55.620> down<00:03:55.830> 224

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
that got the 120 we're stepping down 224

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.970 
that got the 120 we're stepping down 224
the<00:03:57.810> primary<00:03:58.470> has<00:03:58.950> failed<00:04:00.290> now<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> can<00:04:01.560> go<00:04:01.710> here

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the primary has failed now I can go here

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.830 
the primary has failed now I can go here
to<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.250> don't<00:04:02.490> need<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.210> point<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:03.750> I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
to I don't need to at this point but I

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.470 
to I don't need to at this point but I
can<00:04:03.990> go<00:04:04.110> there<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.670> my<00:04:05.850> secondary

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
can go there and see my secondary

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.210 
can go there and see my secondary
actually<00:04:07.050> does<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.590> continuity<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:09.180> again

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
actually does have continuity but again

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.309 
actually does have continuity but again
when<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.250> check<00:04:11.610> my<00:04:11.640> primary

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
when I check my primary

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.189 
when I check my primary
I<00:04:13.349> do<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:16.699> circuit<00:04:17.959> so<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
I do not have a circuit so the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.370 
I do not have a circuit so the
transformer<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.889> bad<00:04:22.729> okay<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:24.020> another<00:04:25.020> video

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
transformer is bad okay in another video

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.810 
transformer is bad okay in another video
we're<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> talk<00:04:26.160> about<00:04:26.190> why<00:04:26.760> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we're going to talk about why the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.879 
we're going to talk about why the
transformer<00:04:27.750> failed<00:04:28.110> usually<00:04:28.800> the

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
transformer failed usually the

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.850 
transformer failed usually the
transformer<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.729> not<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.240> problem<00:04:30.570> it's<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
transformer is not the problem it's the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.480 
transformer is not the problem it's the
weakest<00:04:32.280> link<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.970> chain<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.680> if<00:04:35.160> your

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
weakest link in the chain so if your

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.670 
weakest link in the chain so if your
transformer<00:04:36.150> has<00:04:36.300> failed<00:04:36.720> there's<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
transformer has failed there's a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.600 
transformer has failed there's a
procedure<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.639> go<00:04:39.449> by<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:40.889> make<00:04:41.070> sure<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
procedure to go by to make sure that the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.969 
procedure to go by to make sure that the
second<00:04:42.030> one<00:04:42.150> does<00:04:42.389> not<00:04:42.600> break<00:04:42.930> when<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.650> put

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
second one does not break when you put

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.370 
second one does not break when you put
it<00:04:44.100> in<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.490> we'll<00:04:45.150> talk<00:04:45.360> about<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.229> next

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
it in and we'll talk about that the next

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.770 
it in and we'll talk about that the next
video
