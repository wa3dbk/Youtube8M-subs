it has no nothing's mainly have one

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.319 
it has no nothing's mainly have one

but<00:03:45.979> at<00:03:46.280> least<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.849> working<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:49.220> we<00:03:49.280> will<00:03:49.609> turn

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
but at least is working now we will turn

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:57.300 
but at least is working now we will turn
it<00:03:50.090> on<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:53.329> we<00:03:53.599> can<00:03:53.780> save<00:03:54.169> some<00:03:54.639> monies<00:03:55.639> and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
it on so so we can save some monies and

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.839 
it on so so we can save some monies and
bring<00:03:58.310> back<00:03:58.760> some<00:03:59.169> excitement<00:04:00.370> because<00:04:01.370> he's

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
bring back some excitement because he's

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.969 
bring back some excitement because he's
things<00:04:03.189> sort<00:04:04.189> of<00:04:04.370> without<00:04:04.970> well<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.959> how<00:04:06.439> it

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:06.979

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:13.990 
things sort of without well you how it
it<00:04:07.849> now<00:04:09.579> can<00:04:10.579> only<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.599> dummy<00:04:12.139> because<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
it now can only be a dummy because the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.140 
it now can only be a dummy because the
electronic<00:04:14.840> control<00:04:15.019> is<00:04:15.579> completely<00:04:16.579> gone<00:04:16.609> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
can only switch on and off that's better

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.690 
can only switch on and off that's better
than<00:04:19.699> nothing<00:04:20.260> now<00:04:21.260> i<00:04:21.320> will<00:04:21.620> switch<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.099> on<00:04:22.340> to
