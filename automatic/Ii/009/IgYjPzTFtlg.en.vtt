00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 We are on Sundays trolley oh but no 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.650
 we are entered the face then 5 do not we 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 only one chapter is missing but before 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.580
 of doing that chapter I wanted to do something 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.500
 different good different quotes 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.090
 because you see that we are inside the tail 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 it's a troll tale with which it's going to be 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 very troll too but it's going to be another 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 different game I think it can be very 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.420
 I hope you like it a lot and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.160
 to support it and if so, so I have 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.620
 really want to start the real thing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.620
 so I 'm going to give it to you and let's start 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 and what is this what is this 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 this is the troll this is the troll vale 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.239
 I think this is the character we're going 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.210
 to control during the game and we're going to 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.149
 no wake 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.610
 come and let's see supposedly 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.200
 this is like troll face games 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.400
 quest is with the mouse and we will have to 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.090
 to look we put on our hats and not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.770
 can go ah yes yes yes yes yes that walks 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 we have opened the door we are going to leave 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.480
 our little house rolling is the most 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.820
 quick to get to a site especially 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.990
 if there is a slope down here a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.220
 arrow what 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 we can now fold 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.159
 come on let's put it on mind 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.299
 what is this I get the tics here 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.909
 every time I pressed the button I get 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.740
 up here, it's worth 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.100
 what can we do here good 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100
 walking 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 but good but this is 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.690
 this is like the flap and bert is worth me 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.970
 normal that we do not have to 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.030
 do the flap and see why else if a 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.409
 putada is worth it and now that he looks at it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.409
 look lad wave 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.430
 we have partnered but we have a 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.550
 parachute so we have fallen in the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.800

 kind of hairy creature if it is I do not know 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.150

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.959
 that a cloud will have to come here and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.690

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 home 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.200

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.930
 fairy godmother I do not know what you put there in 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.770
 rave plan that is going to ride a rave 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.990

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.570

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.260

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.870
 It is that it is very surreal 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.640
 true 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.450
 it seems that we can not do anything else 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 here, nothing stays on the radio 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.450

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.640
 and if I give the frog now what happened to no 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.950

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.300
 make the ugly monster disappear 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.140
 this furry 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.000
 Bera Bera Bera now already branded me 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.670
 we have turned a fly into attack with 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 a fly guys because fucking disgust 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.670
 let's go I love I love this 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.390
 troll adventure is wonderful we have 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.650
 little gifts, we are going to have to 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.650
 choose a little gift guys 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.970
 with would choose is the one on the right 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.230
 or better the one on the left or maybe the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.890
 from the center 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.790
 you what do you say come let's choose 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.790
 the center's worth 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.300
 there is nothing damn 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.270
 well come now to the one of the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.060
 left we open there is nothing or not 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.540
 there is nothing none 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.360
 I was in the last one and we have that's it 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.940
 a metal denture so we want 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.419
 this good we will know when we go to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.419
 The next 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.169
 in the next screen 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.949
 what are you going to do to the rabbits but what 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.349
 you do because you scare them good and for 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.530
 back you can not do anything further back 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:13.060
 I do not understand it or it's worth we're going to have 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.189
 what happens for today is very good that 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.990
 denture because look then if you have a 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.180
 problem so you can not go through a 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.629
 ravine because you take a bite of a 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.470
 tree and you already have a bridge or it's great 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:31.390
 ok so we have here ling ling ling 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.330
 snow white vale is the snow is snow and 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.640
 white is white I do not know what site it is 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.050
 this stranger we fall worth 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.860
 I imagined because there is a staircase down 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:46.300
 this one who is the bearded one what 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.670
 we woke tomás but this is that is 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.790
 here we steal things from people 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.180
 thus throwing things to his face is very 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.210
 we caught it strange key here not 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.940
 We can not do anything else 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.860
 I'm sorry I'm sorry, maybe it's maybe 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.590
 I could have tried something before but 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.009
 directly so that for you to throw 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.360
 the metal denture to the head is worth 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.150
 I think we can enter with the key 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.430
 I mean not with the key, not because we have 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.750
 stuck a kick to the door there 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.000
 here 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.249
 ok we have a nice beard 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.889
 straw 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.989
 and let's see what we can do 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:26.969
 the hat and ask for it but because it's going 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:29.299
 but because it goes or is the 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.679
 scarecrow was just running 

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:34.589
 and the owner of the house is also gone 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:36.689
 back then it leaves us the house 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.909
 for us we have the key we can 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.210
 enter and we meet here a woman 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:45.740
 very very 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:48.110
 very tall is not very tall this good woman 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.780
 let's see if we can catch something from the 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.840
 table that this bread loaves me the 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.319
 I take all I take them all kid 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.240
 Of course we have more here 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.470
 a window that we went through the 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.340
 window is already woman does nothing 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.729
 let's go and now scream that they are dwarfs 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.939
 I think of dwarfs 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:12.580
 troll whores this troll is a bastard 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.870
 gone I like I like it okay we have a 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.819
 horse or we have left by the 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.999
 window and we have stood on top of 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:21.610
 a perfect horse then let's go and have 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:24.659
 here come the dwarfs behind this 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.659
