together all of these frog Park the
train<00:01:32.500> station<00:01:32.890> would<00:01:33.310> be<00:01:33.490> having<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.820> nice

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
train station would be having a nice

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.960 
train station would be having a nice
open<00:01:34.360> sort<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.140> way<00:01:35.650> onto<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.040> trains<00:01:36.340> it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
open sort of way onto the trains it's

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.609 
open sort of way onto the trains it's
out<00:01:37.119> I<00:01:37.150> think<00:01:37.270> sense<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.900> at<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.259> back<00:01:38.380> it

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
out I think sense and at the back it

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.679 
out I think sense and at the back it
should<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:38.860> nice<00:01:39.040> flat<00:01:39.430> wall<00:01:39.790> really<00:01:40.479> nice

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
should be a nice flat wall really nice

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.480 
should be a nice flat wall really nice
some<00:01:41.140> windows<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.770> which<00:01:41.979> will<00:01:42.130> also<00:01:42.340> lead

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
some windows in it which will also lead

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.340 
some windows in it which will also lead
onto<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.939> road<00:01:43.150> which<00:01:43.630> will<00:01:43.810> be<00:01:44.020> building

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
onto the road which will be building

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.300 
onto the road which will be building
later<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.189> video

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 

then<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.590> other<00:01:55.740> side<00:01:55.980> and<00:01:56.220> make

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
then we go to the other side and make

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.710 
then we go to the other side and make
the<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.610> ticket<00:01:57.000> office<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.420> nothing

the briefing room sort of make a little

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
the briefing room sort of make a little
bit<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.240> clock<00:02:06.630> towering<00:02:07.020> away<00:02:07.260> except<00:02:07.620> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
bit of a clock towering away except it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469 
bit of a clock towering away except it
didn't<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.040> clock<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.430> it<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.210> then<00:02:09.360> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
didn't have a clock in it and then we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.790 
didn't have a clock in it and then we
have<00:02:09.660> none<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.020> front<00:02:10.350> where<00:02:10.590> we're

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
have none to the front where we're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
have none to the front where we're

stacking this with worldedit later on to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.790 
stacking this with worldedit later on to
speed<00:02:14.940> things<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.140> main<00:02:16.530> train

you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.840> I've<00:02:21.990> stacked<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you can see here but I've stacked a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.110 
you can see here but I've stacked a
train<00:02:22.740> track<00:02:23.040> through<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.550> platform<00:02:23.790> over

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
train track through the platform over

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.380 
train track through the platform over
there

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
there

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.120 
there
if<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.630> go<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.020> way<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> camera<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
if I go out the way the camera all the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.710 
if I go out the way the camera all the
way<00:02:26.310> down<00:02:26.520> sort<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.180> making<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
way down sort of making a bit of a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.480 
way down sort of making a bit of a
tunnel<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.290> which<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.100> working<00:02:29.430> on

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
tunnel here which is what I'm working on

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.790 
tunnel here which is what I'm working on
now<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.720> entrance<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.290> would<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.590> having

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
now so the entrance this would be having

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.100 
now so the entrance this would be having
a<00:02:31.950> Keysha<00:02:32.220> wood<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.850> some<00:02:33.030> stone<00:02:33.420> brick

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
a Keysha wood and some stone brick

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.220 
a Keysha wood and some stone brick
stairs<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:35.130> top<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.420> design<00:02:36.750> itself

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
stairs on top and the design itself

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
stairs on top and the design itself
would<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:37.590> all<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.860> way<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.700> quite<00:02:39.060> quite

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
would go all the way down it quite quite

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.180 
would go all the way down it quite quite
simple<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.960> inside<00:02:40.230> sorry<00:02:40.500> which<00:02:40.890> just

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
simple on the inside sorry which just

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.130 
simple on the inside sorry which just
has<00:02:41.340> some<00:02:41.550> stone<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.390> cobblestone<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
has some stone and some cobblestone and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
has some stone and some cobblestone and
the<00:02:43.590> other<00:02:43.770> end<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.130> tunnel<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.940> sort<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the other end of a tunnel it's sort of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.880 
the other end of a tunnel it's sort of
like<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.750> Surat<00:02:46.020> came<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.380> or<00:02:46.620> broken

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
like the Surat came out or broken

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
like the Surat came out or broken
mountain<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> cared<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.360> fuel<00:02:48.630> by<00:02:48.750> adding

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
mountain so I cared this fuel by adding

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.170 
mountain so I cared this fuel by adding
a<00:02:49.110> nice<00:02:49.260> little<00:02:49.440> bridge<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.340> stuff<00:02:50.910> use

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
a nice little bridge in and stuff use

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.150 
a nice little bridge in and stuff use
free<00:02:51.480> squid<00:02:51.720> pillars<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.260> thought<00:02:52.800> was<00:02:52.920> really

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
free squid pillars I thought was really

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.500 
free squid pillars I thought was really
kept<00:02:53.430> natural<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> Elephant<00:02:54.420> Mountain

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
kept natural for the Elephant Mountain

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.540 
kept natural for the Elephant Mountain
and<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> spoil<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:56.040> too<00:02:56.280> much

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and I don't want to spoil it too much

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.670 
and I don't want to spoil it too much
now<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:59.790> sack<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> other<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.410> past

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
now a sack of the other way that past

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680 
now a sack of the other way that past
the<00:03:01.860> platform<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:02.970> what<00:03:03.180> goes<00:03:03.390> down

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the platform and that's what goes down

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.960 
the platform and that's what goes down
towards<00:03:03.959> recycling<00:03:04.770> center<00:03:05.100> or<00:03:05.340> into<00:03:05.700> town

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
towards recycling center or into town

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
towards recycling center or into town
now<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> same<00:03:07.500> entrance<00:03:07.950> into

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
now this is what the same entrance into

see<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:15.420> we're<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.440> having<00:03:16.590> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
see up here we're going to be having a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.170 
see up here we're going to be having a
bit<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.860> level<00:03:17.190> crossing<00:03:17.640> or<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.820> railroad

bit of level crossing or a railroad

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.670 
bit of level crossing or a railroad
crossing<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.750> don't<00:03:19.019> know<00:03:19.080> what<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.290> she<00:03:19.470> was

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
crossing I don't know what that she was

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.320 
crossing I don't know what that she was
doing<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.850> would<00:03:21.060> sort<00:03:21.300> of

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
doing in there but this would sort of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.060 
doing in there but this would sort of
mean<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.630> have<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.989> bring<00:03:22.260> your<00:03:22.380> Road<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.800> in

line with the train track itself and it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.660

would have be anything too different

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.130 
would have be anything too different
it'd<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:26.880> be<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.090> road<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.720> sort<00:03:28.110> of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
it'd just be the road going up sort of

also going to up a little road which
came<00:03:50.190> off

which<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.640> thought<00:03:58.910> is<00:03:59.120> little<00:03:59.480> bit<00:03:59.570> different

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
which I thought is little bit different

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.780 
which I thought is little bit different
to<00:04:00.050> what<00:04:00.080> we'd<00:04:00.350> had<00:04:00.590> in<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:01.250> restaurant<00:04:01.610> for

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
spring I continued the road here and

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.100 
spring I continued the road here and
you'll<00:04:04.850> see<00:04:05.060> in<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.270> minute<00:04:05.360> I'd<00:04:05.630> bring<00:04:05.960> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you'll see in a minute I'd bring the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.590 
you'll see in a minute I'd bring the
road<00:04:06.260> up<00:04:06.470> by<00:04:06.800> one<00:04:07.040> level<00:04:07.310> now<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.270> because

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
road up by one level now this is because

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
of course this is the same design for

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.740 
of course this is the same design for

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
station is itself right here you can see

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.440 
station is itself right here you can see
so<00:05:01.220> I'm<00:05:01.280> going<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.550> bring<00:05:01.880> out<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.180> road<00:05:02.420> a

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
so I'm going to bring out this road a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.910 
so I'm going to bring out this road a
little<00:05:02.720> bit<00:05:02.870> further<00:05:03.200> now<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.680> would<00:05:03.800> go

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
little bit further now it would go

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.100 
little bit further now it would go
mainly<00:05:04.460> ups<00:05:04.640> up<00:05:04.760> main<00:05:05.060> entrance<00:05:05.600> towards<00:05:06.020> a

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
mainly ups up main entrance towards a

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.540 
mainly ups up main entrance towards a
train<00:05:06.290> station<00:05:06.740> which<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:06.980> can<00:05:07.130> see<00:05:07.310> there

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
train station which you can see there

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.880 
train station which you can see there
and<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.540> wouldn't<00:05:08.750> be<00:05:08.870> -<00:05:09.050> while<00:05:09.320> I<00:05:09.350> did<00:05:09.560> only<00:05:09.740> be

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
and it wouldn't be - while I did only be

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.130 
and it wouldn't be - while I did only be
I<00:05:09.919> think<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:10.280> seven<00:05:10.610> wide<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.810> you'll<00:05:11.960> see

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
I think it's seven wide and you'll see

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.120 
I think it's seven wide and you'll see
me<00:05:12.290> in<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.410> minute<00:05:12.560> we'll<00:05:12.800> make<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:12.950> little

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
me in a minute we'll make a little

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.190 
me in a minute we'll make a little
loading<00:05:13.640> bay<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:13.850> sort<00:05:14.180> parking<00:05:14.690> area<00:05:14.990> maybe

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
loading bay and sort parking area maybe

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.650 
loading bay and sort parking area maybe
just<00:05:15.650> from<00:05:15.830> other<00:05:15.980> cars<00:05:16.250> which<00:05:17.210> you'll<00:05:17.390> see<00:05:17.419> we

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
just from other cars which you'll see we

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.330 
just from other cars which you'll see we
do<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.080> couple<00:05:18.380> of<00:05:18.440> seconds<00:05:18.800> right<00:05:18.980> here<00:05:19.250> I'm

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
do in a couple of seconds right here I'm

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.940 
do in a couple of seconds right here I'm
just<00:05:19.400> go<00:05:19.669> dig<00:05:19.940> out<00:05:20.060> all<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.450> land<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.800> it

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
just go dig out all the land and it

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.080 
just go dig out all the land and it
doesn't<00:05:22.160> actually<00:05:22.220> take<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.669> long<00:05:22.850> so<00:05:23.000> they

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
doesn't actually take that long so they

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.060 
doesn't actually take that long so they
got<00:05:23.240> land<00:05:23.450> but<00:05:23.840> yes<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.260> little<00:05:24.530> loading<00:05:24.950> bay

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
got land but yes this little loading bay

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.010 
got land but yes this little loading bay
here<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:26.000> can<00:05:26.180> see<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.330> saw<00:05:26.570> make<00:05:26.780> up<00:05:26.900> the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
here you can see I saw make up the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.540 
here you can see I saw make up the
yellow<00:05:27.200> plate<00:05:27.500> but<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.710> feel<00:05:27.919> it's<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.130> bit<00:05:28.160> too

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
yellow plate but I feel it's a bit too

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.790 
yellow plate but I feel it's a bit too
small<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.180> changed<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.720> off-camera<00:05:29.870> and

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
small so I changed that off-camera and

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.320 
small so I changed that off-camera and
then<00:05:30.950> when<00:05:31.160> we<00:05:31.280> do<00:05:31.430> come<00:05:31.700> back<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.120> we're

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
then when we do come back to it we're

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.880 
then when we do come back to it we're
going<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.600> make<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.900> one<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> Danny's<00:05:33.440> vehicles

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
going to make it one of Danny's vehicles

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.440 
going to make it one of Danny's vehicles
now<00:05:34.220> if<00:05:34.310> it's<00:05:34.430> just<00:05:34.580> quite<00:05:34.730> simply<00:05:34.760> a<00:05:35.150> small

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
now if it's just quite simply a small

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.900 
now if it's just quite simply a small
delivery<00:05:35.900> value<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.560> get<00:05:36.740> too<00:05:36.919> big<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.760> was<00:05:37.850> a

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
delivery value and get too big it was a

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.970 
delivery value and get too big it was a
really<00:05:38.150> good<00:05:38.360> design<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.230> for<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.530> was<00:05:39.800> going

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
really good design and I for I was going

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.320 
really good design and I for I was going
to<00:05:40.100> use<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.310> right<00:05:40.490> here<00:05:40.910> because<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.180> thought

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
to use it right here because I thought

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.480 
to use it right here because I thought
it<00:05:41.510> gave<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.720> really<00:05:42.050> nice<00:05:42.200> bit<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:42.860> color<00:05:43.130> to

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
it gave a really nice bit of color to

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.820 
it gave a really nice bit of color to
the<00:05:43.610> back<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.300> train<00:05:44.510> station<00:05:44.990> now<00:05:45.800> a

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
the back of the train station now a

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.350 
the back of the train station now a
message<00:05:46.040> to<00:05:46.220> someone<00:05:46.430> a<00:05:46.580> tunnel<00:05:46.970> where<00:05:47.180> I've

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
message to someone a tunnel where I've

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.330 
message to someone a tunnel where I've
stacked<00:05:47.690> down<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.410> train<00:05:48.770> track<00:05:49.040> designs

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340
