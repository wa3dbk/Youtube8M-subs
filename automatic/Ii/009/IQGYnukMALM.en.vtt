00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at the leaderboard here it was three

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.500 
at the leaderboard here it was three
verses<00:01:01.320> six<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.829> entire<00:01:02.250> game<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:03.120> until<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
verses six this entire game up until I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
verses six this entire game up until I
think<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> last<00:01:04.170> round<00:01:04.530> where<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:05.010> two

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think the last round where I think two

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
think the last round where I think two
people<00:01:05.250> joined<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> didn't<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.270> any<00:01:06.450> kills

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
people joined and didn't get any kills

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.230 
people joined and didn't get any kills
cuz<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.049> sucked<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> reminds<00:01:08.939> me<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
cuz they sucked but that reminds me of

game<00:03:42.530> on<00:03:42.710> domination<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.490> then<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.390> know

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
game on domination and then you know

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.290 
game on domination and then you know
