00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
now it's it's moving kind of like a

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.050 
now it's it's moving kind of like a
carousel<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.840> could<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.350> 360<00:01:35.130> degrees<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.940> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
carousel and I could go 360 degrees if I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840 
carousel and I could go 360 degrees if I
wanted<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.200> go<00:01:37.590> completely<00:01:38.190> around<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.820> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
wanted to and go completely around but I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.150 
wanted to and go completely around but I
just<00:01:39.060> stopped<00:01:39.330> on<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.530> far<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:40.920> came

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
just stopped on what that far and came

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.840 
just stopped on what that far and came
back<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.390> again<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
back and then again I can put it on a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
back and then again I can put it on a
solid<00:01:45.180> surface<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.960> point<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.230> down<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.800> up<00:01:47.010> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
solid surface and point it down or up or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.800 
solid surface and point it down or up or
sideways<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.120> pointing<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.570> down

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
sideways and here I'm pointing it down

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
sideways and here I'm pointing it down
at<00:01:49.050> my<00:01:49.170> table<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.830> just<00:01:50.570> again<00:01:52.550> going<00:01:53.550> around

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
at my table and just again going around

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
at my table and just again going around
the<00:01:55.350> table<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.970> really<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.720> cool<00:01:58.170> feature<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the table it's really a cool feature I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
the table it's really a cool feature I
did<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.370> that<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.820> would<00:02:00.120> use<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
did I know that I would use this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.950 
did I know that I would use this
probably<00:02:01.260> for<00:02:01.470> something<00:02:01.650> like<00:02:02.010> macro<00:02:02.960> to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
probably for something like macro to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
probably for something like macro to
where<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> could<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.680> put<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.580> hang

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
where I could actually put it and hang

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.000 
where I could actually put it and hang
it<00:02:06.450> over<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> table<00:02:07.260> or<00:02:07.380> maybe<00:02:07.590> even<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
it over the table or maybe even like

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.889 
it over the table or maybe even like
water<00:02:08.310> drops<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> shoot<00:02:09.600> every

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
water drops that I like to shoot every

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
water drops that I like to shoot every
once<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.260> a<00:02:10.350> while<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.980> hang<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> over

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
once in a while and just hang it over

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.810 
once in a while and just hang it over
the<00:02:12.210> sink<00:02:12.600> instead<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.200> having<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:14.190> about

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the sink instead of having to be about

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.180 
the sink instead of having to be about
three<00:02:15.120> feet<00:02:15.330> away<00:02:15.480> from<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> sink<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.380> again

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
three feet away from the sink so again

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
three feet away from the sink so again
some<00:02:17.490> cool<00:02:17.730> features<00:02:18.170> really<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
