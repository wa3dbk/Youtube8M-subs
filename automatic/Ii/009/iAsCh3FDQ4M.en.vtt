small patch to xenoverse I think it was

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.919 
small patch to xenoverse I think it was
just<00:00:13.950> around<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.370> 25<00:00:14.790> mega<00:00:15.179> patch<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.719> did

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
which fixed a little a couple things but

which fixed a little a couple things but
the<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> wanted<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> talk<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.890> drastic<00:00:20.279> one

the one I wanted to talk the drastic one

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.970 
the one I wanted to talk the drastic one
I<00:00:20.460> wanted<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> talk<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.090> today<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.439> fix

I wanted to talk about today was the fix

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.029 
I wanted to talk about today was the fix
to<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> fused<00:00:23.640> car<00:00:23.939> me<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.269> piccolo<00:00:24.689> Z<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.199> now

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
to the fused car me and piccolo Z so now

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.009 
to the fused car me and piccolo Z so now
this<00:00:26.460> C<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.240> sure<00:00:27.269> you've<00:00:27.570> known<00:00:27.750> it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
this C so as I'm sure you've known it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.620 
this C so as I'm sure you've known it
gives<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> slight<00:00:28.769> increase<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.519> stats<00:00:29.820> HP

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
gives a slight increase in all stats HP

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
gives a slight increase in all stats HP
slowly<00:00:31.050> recovers<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:31.679> ki<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> maxed<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
slowly recovers when ki is maxed and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
slowly recovers when ki is maxed and
when<00:00:33.480> stamina<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.110> maxed<00:00:34.469> auto<00:00:34.649> guard

activates<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.329> that's<00:00:36.809> pretty<00:00:37.530> damn<00:00:38.040> good

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
activates now that's pretty damn good

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.220 
activates now that's pretty damn good
but<00:00:40.200> prior<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> patch<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.480> billion

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
but prior to the patch it was a billion

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.880 
but prior to the patch it was a billion
times<00:00:43.500> better

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
times better

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
times better
basically<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.360> demonstratively<00:00:46.320> broken

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
basically it was demonstratively broken

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
basically it was demonstratively broken
prior<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:47.969> happening<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.260> was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
prior what was happening the game was

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.459 
prior what was happening the game was
basing<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> HP<00:00:50.730> regen<00:00:51.059> off<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.989> framerate

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
basing the HP regen off your framerate

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.420 
basing the HP regen off your framerate
as<00:00:52.980> opposed<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> solid<00:00:55.020> number<00:00:55.770> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
as opposed to just a solid number so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
as opposed to just a solid number so
pretty<00:00:56.699> much<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.270> mean<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.109> if

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pretty much what I mean by that is if

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
pretty much what I mean by that is if
I'm<00:00:58.800> playing<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> game<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> hundred<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
I'm playing the game at a hundred and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
I'm playing the game at a hundred and
fifty<00:01:00.570> frames<00:01:00.840> per<00:01:01.079> second<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> regen

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
fifty frames per second I would be regen

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.789 
fifty frames per second I would be regen
health<00:01:03.290> 150<00:01:04.460> units<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.729> HP<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:07.140> opposed<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
health 150 units or HP as opposed to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
health 150 units or HP as opposed to
someone<00:01:08.220> who's<00:01:08.970> playing<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> game<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.659> 50<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
someone who's playing the game at 50 or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.060 
someone who's playing the game at 50 or
60<00:01:10.799> FPS<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.970> only<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.420> regen<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.080> 60<00:01:13.830> health

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
60 FPS will only be regen in 60 health

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.929 
60 FPS will only be regen in 60 health
per<00:01:14.250> second<00:01:14.640> which<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.939> game-changing

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
per second which is pretty game-changing

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
per second which is pretty game-changing
so<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> hundred<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.869> fifty<00:01:19.110> fps<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.799> much

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
so the hundred and fifty fps pretty much

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.370 
so the hundred and fifty fps pretty much
meant<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.970> people<00:01:21.180> could<00:01:21.479> lay<00:01:21.689> into<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.110> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
meant that people could lay into you in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
meant that people could lay into you in
PvP<00:01:22.830> PvE<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.479> recover<00:01:24.869> more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
PvP PvE and you would recover more

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
PvP PvE and you would recover more
health<00:01:25.500> than<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:25.979> could<00:01:26.159> dish<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.520> while

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
health than they could dish out while

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.109 
health than they could dish out while
punching<00:01:27.229> now<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:29.130> ridiculous<00:01:29.909> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
punching now that's was ridiculous so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
punching now that's was ridiculous so
that<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.369> bit<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> patch<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that was a bit of the patch but now the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
that was a bit of the patch but now the
new<00:01:35.159> meta<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.670> people<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.000> gone<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> after

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
new meta that people have gone to after

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
new meta that people have gone to after
this<00:01:36.659> obviously<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> needed<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.409> find

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this obviously we needed to find

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
this obviously we needed to find
something<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.070> different<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.520> PvP<00:01:38.939> PvE<00:01:39.119> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
something a bit different for PvP PvE is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.850 
something a bit different for PvP PvE is
Android<00:01:40.710> 20s<00:01:41.220> Z<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.290> again<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> at

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
Android 20s Z so this one again is at

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
Android 20s Z so this one again is at
the<00:01:43.950> mixing<00:01:44.280> station<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.820> increases<00:01:45.360> the

the mixing station it increases the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
the mixing station it increases the
speed<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.960> key<00:01:46.259> charge<00:01:46.530> also<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.759> gain<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
speed of key charge also you gain a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
speed of key charge also you gain a
chance<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> recover<00:01:48.750> HP<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> HP<00:01:50.729> sorry
