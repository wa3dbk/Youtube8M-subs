00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:20.529

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.289

 snowfall 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.260
 good morning 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.579
 I understand that 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.240
 That's a big difference between sales 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.540
 who want to move 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.519
 the fifth time wrong parked I have I well I do not want to get over 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.050
 of course we also close here 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.760
 why first let's go 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.980
 I have been a bit pathetic there for thirteen years 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.229
 it's time for different 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.030
 if facebook gets the context then the name that is also would not need 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.460
 used without making it happen that the last one wanted to go 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.200
 years at home and on vacation and android 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 and we thought it was interesting to have lived and now we did it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.190
 there may be the number of women in new zealand the other engines and 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.730
 show that actually my 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.680
 because you have to look into what went on about a year later Thursday 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.079
 earlier 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.670
 perhaps here is close by or for a heavy aftershocks whose attention 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.710
 Moreover, you should not have a little one 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.370
 viewing figures 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 after the Frisian lakes 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 years of free storage 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.540
 who make sure that he himself has been married for two years and informed the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 emergency services provided with goods 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.500
 lead to a new part of technical problems 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 Anyway that's something ohra is talking about because it is already foreseeable 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.210
 technology is more of the youth center fortunately the bonuses again that kind 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.020
 things can be seen on my gray smoke, among other things, assange sees the euro 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.750
 damage 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.130
 yes that is actually a bit of what you dare 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.580
 the game image there it is because I have multiple goals but once the core 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.050
 already had and that headlines we go the cars of bass complaints so then you go 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.809
 just the s80 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.449
 but then a usable if anything is possible but I go for it 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.759
 try today 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.009

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.729
 bring in function 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 Well I am mainly interested in the viewer himself 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.560
 9 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.379
 it would be three prizes 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 justice in france 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.849
 the list leaders of the eleven was through the streets 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.539
 he said he didn't want that 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.539
 following life 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.719
 that's upcoming 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.320
 No 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 the the figure 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.209
 it is advisable 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.019
 he stands 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.419
 I am not me 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.459
 we will not escape that 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.539
 here's a good wk 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.749
 now it seems like again how much influence is always useful 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.569
 it has been stopped 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.159
 awful ribÃ©ry must be interested in it 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.439
 yes someone who has the head there or violence will not be posted 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.269
 know it in a communication 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.369
 holman this is a bit weird idea to restore education 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.610

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.300
 at 5 million 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.090
 hommen deliver a digger 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.090
 then you have this beautiful fuss 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.490
 the windless weather 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.770
 it was therefore a first circulation art 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.779
 and start on the water on the bank 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.520
 by investing less 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.759
 and a lot of fun also from very far 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.999
