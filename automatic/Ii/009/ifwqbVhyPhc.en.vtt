00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 17 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.490
 or the entrance of pokémon welcome to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.820
 barbie channel said good so let's go to 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.320
 do today the catch of are of sweat is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.530
 our 'legendary pokémon of the wind and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.170
 the storm and the storms that 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.940
 it's usually the pokemon videos 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.220
 well we already know in 2.0 but due to the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.300
 peculiarity of this pokemon of 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.100
 get away every time I met him 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.220
 I had to do a montage of 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.010
 video so I'm going to teach where to 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.870
 put where we can not start 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.300
 find us on the road and then 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.460
 more or less to do to find the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.000
 wolves to touch we have to come to the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.680
 route 7 and álex cross ahead the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.530
 door of this house, it does not come out 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.629
 anita stay that warns us that there is a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.060
 pokémon that has already returned to the old 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.240
 doing theirs with the change 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240
 climate 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.360
 the notice that things are happening 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.500
 strange on route 7 good that there is a 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.970
 strange weather on route 7 give us this 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.160
 edition to the girl in the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.950
 information desk before 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.900
 access Victoria Street before 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.000
 start there our extensive towards the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.760
 pokemon league zone 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 at the time I came to take a look 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.700
 around here but obviously I did not get to 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.440
 until the entrance door of this 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.130
 house therefore I could not 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.740
 I could not find out what was happening here with 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.660
 the donuts but now yes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.410
 that explains is fine and it is therefore that the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.100
 causing all these anomalies 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.840
 climatological because it is this pokemon this 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 legendary pokemon 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.000
 and on top of that I spoiled the crops and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.759
 if it can not be and have ever thought 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 in catching him but he is not still 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.300
 when you think you have it, it escapes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.880
 Well, it took a day to turn around 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.880
 complete in the morning until in the south 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.770
 at night in the north and being that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.250
 rule of three would have to go through here 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.250
 At dusk 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 because there is the information that gives us 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.070
 then now when leaving this little house 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.910
 the presence will make us 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.180
 legendary pokemon 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.800
 there we have it there appears in 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.480
 our case 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.250
 for the white edition that I chose then 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.780
 they are donuts 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.700
 or whatever the name is pronounced 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.099
 the pokemon 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.819
 and that is why we are presented here what 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:01.180
 we are to blame for these anomalies of the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.610
 time is this pokemon then a 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 Once this presentation is made, we are going to 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.769
 to be able to locate it by the announcements that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.260
 we have in these route steps the route 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.370
 they will tell us in this case they told us 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.530
 route 3 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.780
 rain and thunder and lightning or something by 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.190
 style 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.410
 this means that in this area is the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.600
 pokemon and what we have to do then 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.550
 is to get into the grass and we 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.750
 appear then what happens that your 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.490
 pokemon that every time I tried 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.420
 to treat it in the po that bolt 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.630
 instantly 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.310
 he was leaving in the next shift he was leaving my 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.310
 pokemon are now very high level 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.140
 quite higher 2015 from 15 to 20 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.870
 levels above it therefore not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.730
 I can hit him because I kill him so 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.200
 I have come to the decision I have taken the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.020
 decision that I will make use of the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.880
 little special ball that we get the master 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.590
 ball that only give us one to catch 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.709
 This pokemon that because I 'm not going to 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.569
 fail and because I no longer have only 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.920
 I have a more legendary pokémon the 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.480
 get body in this game 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.299
 because as before afternoon I can not 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.100
 get any other special pokemon 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.350
 so what I said I use the master ball 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.970
 and he assured me that the pokemon stays 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.280
 here locked up and doing I have to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.490
 be around all teselia 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.050
 to try to capture it fast clean and 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.690
 simple because others already have them 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.800
 besides adding that I think it's a 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.259
 good option to use this pokemon 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.840
 infallible against this pokemon because well 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.210
 he is not giving us he does not take them 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.470
 turns around for all of the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.990
 teselia map 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.560
 Well I said well nothing we have here 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.060
 to this legendary pokémon and only 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.860
 we have one left but it is still at a level 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.660
 a little too high for 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.050
 us so pokémon trainers 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.640
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.880
 You already know that we are seeing each other in 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.590
 next episodes of this game that 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.300
 although the little things to see and so on 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.300
 series so see you later
