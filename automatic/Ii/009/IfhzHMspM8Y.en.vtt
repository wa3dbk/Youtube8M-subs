going to go so if I put a block here to

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.390 
going to go so if I put a block here to
end<00:01:02.899> going<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.109> go<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.350> direction<00:01:03.499> or<00:01:04.159> that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400

direction and which guy do now secret

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.550 
direction and which guy do now secret
minecarts<00:01:07.640> put<00:01:08.450> them<00:01:08.539> like<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:08.810> on<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
minecarts put them like this on the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.429 
minecarts put them like this on the
tracks<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:10.360> then<00:01:11.360> what<00:01:11.539> do<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.719> do<00:01:11.780> now<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.200> take

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
tracks and then what do I do now is take

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.789 
tracks and then what do I do now is take
it<00:01:12.590> or<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.860> blocks<00:01:13.100> let's<00:01:13.969> give<00:01:14.180> them<00:01:14.270> all

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
it or the blocks let's give them all

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.359 
it or the blocks let's give them all
like<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.689> is<00:01:17.689> once<00:01:17.930> that's<00:01:18.110> done<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:19.219> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
so let's do that now you can see it's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.429 
so let's do that now you can see it's
gonna<00:01:24.649> go<00:01:24.859> and<00:01:25.490> we're<00:01:25.579> gonna<00:01:25.700> rad<00:01:26.229> it's<00:01:27.229> really

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
gonna go and we're gonna rad it's really

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.569 
gonna go and we're gonna rad it's really
cool<00:01:27.649> I'm<00:01:27.890> not<00:01:28.009> sure<00:01:28.070> if<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.430> been

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
cool I'm not sure if it's been

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.490 
cool I'm not sure if it's been
discovered<00:01:28.939> yet<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.509> father<00:01:29.780> was<00:01:29.990> really<00:01:30.320> I

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
discovered yet by father was really I

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.830 
discovered yet by father was really I
can<00:01:30.859> see<00:01:31.009> one<00:01:31.159> went<00:01:31.369> off<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.719> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
can see one went off but this is how it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.690 
can see one went off but this is how it
really<00:01:32.929> works<00:01:33.140> um<00:01:33.500> was<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.280> how<00:01:34.429> I<00:01:34.460> think

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
really works um was that is how I think

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.039 
really works um was that is how I think
it<00:01:34.789> worked<00:01:34.909> all<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.090> minecart<00:01:35.450> restock<00:01:35.810> and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
it worked all the minecart restock and

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.660 
it worked all the minecart restock and
they're<00:01:36.259> just<00:01:36.770> don't<00:01:37.070> know<00:01:37.189> it's<00:01:37.399> moving

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
they're just don't know it's moving

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.219 
they're just don't know it's moving
forward<00:01:38.060> they're<00:01:38.270> all<00:01:38.359> stuck<00:01:38.600> together<00:01:38.689> so

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
forward they're all stuck together so

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.749 
forward they're all stuck together so
creates<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:39.890> glitch<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.310> where<00:01:40.429> they<00:01:40.579> don't

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
creates a glitch to where they don't

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.999 
creates a glitch to where they don't
break<00:01:41.479> apart<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.609> if<00:01:43.609> you<00:01:43.969> hit<00:01:44.600> them<00:01:44.689> all

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
break apart and if you hit them all

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.440 
break apart and if you hit them all
that's<00:01:46.009> why<00:01:46.130> i<00:01:46.159> said<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.369> more<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.549> better<00:01:46.670> so

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's why i said the more the better so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.749 
that's why i said the more the better so
if<00:01:47.600> i<00:01:47.689> have<00:01:47.719> let's<00:01:48.200> say<00:01:48.350> 20<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.039> them<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.340> going

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
if i have let's say 20 of them is going

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.190 
if i have let's say 20 of them is going
if<00:01:50.060> they're<00:01:50.240> all<00:01:50.359> connected<00:01:50.659> next<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.109> each

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
if they're all connected next to each

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.989 
if they're all connected next to each
other<00:01:51.320> it's<00:01:51.679> going<00:01:51.859> to<00:01:51.890> take<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:52.249> 20<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
other it's going to take all 20 of the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.169 
other it's going to take all 20 of the
fall<00:01:53.149> apart<00:01:53.450> before<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.259> stops<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:55.249> even

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
fall apart before it all stops and even

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.940 
fall apart before it all stops and even
if<00:01:56.240> i<00:01:56.299> put<00:01:56.539> up<00:01:56.630> track<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.049> front<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.499> that's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
if i put up track in front of it that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.410 
if i put up track in front of it that's
what<00:01:58.189> disperses<00:01:58.789> it<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.119> that's<00:01:59.270> how<00:01:59.359> you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
what disperses it so that's how you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.940 
what disperses it so that's how you
going<00:01:59.689> to<00:01:59.749> basically<00:01:59.929> stop<00:02:00.350> yourself<00:02:00.560> and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to basically stop yourself and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.760 
going to basically stop yourself and
stop<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.369> carts<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:01.960> subtract<00:02:02.960> now<00:02:03.439> what<00:02:03.710> I

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
stop the carts and subtract now what I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.679 
stop the carts and subtract now what I
also<00:02:03.950> did<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.759> was<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:04.969> first<00:02:05.210> time<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.450> did

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
also did that was the first time I did

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.719 
also did that was the first time I did
while<00:02:05.869> inside<00:02:06.289> of<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.649> what<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.130> also<00:02:07.280> did<00:02:07.549> one

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
while inside of it what I also did one

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.669 
while inside of it what I also did one
time<00:02:07.939> was<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:08.539> was<00:02:09.020> running<00:02:09.319> up<00:02:09.380> against<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
time was I was running up against the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.500 
time was I was running up against the
tracks<00:02:09.920> i'm<00:02:10.130> just<00:02:10.280> putting<00:02:10.429> them<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:10.700> down<00:02:10.880> as

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
tracks i'm just putting them all down as

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.640 
tracks i'm just putting them all down as
it<00:02:11.660> moves<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.170> so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
it moves like so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.679 
it moves like so
and<00:02:12.829> they<00:02:13.519> would<00:02:13.670> hit<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.239> would<00:02:14.360> hit<00:02:14.540> it

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
and they would hit it they would hit it

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.059 
and they would hit it they would hit it
and<00:02:14.810> they<00:02:14.989> just<00:02:15.019> move<00:02:15.439> on<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.829> second

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
and they just move on for a second

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.399 
and they just move on for a second
continue<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.519> they<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.329> do<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.230> I'm

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
continue on they just do like that I'm

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.960 
continue on they just do like that I'm
pretty<00:02:18.860> shocked<00:02:19.099> that's<00:02:19.370> what<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.549> does<00:02:19.700> with

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
pretty shocked that's what it does with

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.640 
pretty shocked that's what it does with
inside<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.720> car<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.409> never<00:02:21.530> happened

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
inside the car that's never happened

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.789 
inside the car that's never happened
before<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.250> think<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.209> fact<00:02:24.049> that<00:02:24.170> outside<00:02:24.769> of

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
before I think the fact that outside of

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.460 
before I think the fact that outside of
it<00:02:25.040> did<00:02:25.310> something<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.879> player<00:02:26.120> into<00:02:27.079> entity

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it did something the player into entity

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.550 
it did something the player into entity
did<00:02:27.890> something<00:02:28.189> to<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.640> minecarts<00:02:29.329> but<00:02:29.560> Julie

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
did something to the minecarts but Julie

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.990 
did something to the minecarts but Julie
quickly<00:02:30.859> as<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.159> can<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.549> went<00:02:31.760> pretty

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
quickly as you can see we went pretty

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.750 
quickly as you can see we went pretty
far<00:02:32.299> very<00:02:32.720> quickly<00:02:33.159> we<00:02:34.159> cover<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.489> lot<00:02:34.730> of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
far very quickly we cover a lot of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.660 
far very quickly we cover a lot of
ground<00:02:35.120> without<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.290> need<00:02:36.439> of<00:02:36.500> mine<00:02:36.769> carts<00:02:37.129> so

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
ground without the need of mine carts so

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.819 
ground without the need of mine carts so
you<00:02:37.730> could<00:02:37.939> take<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.420> idea<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:38.840> probably

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
you could take this idea and probably

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.440 
you could take this idea and probably
possibly<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.400> here<00:02:40.519> in<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.640> second<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> show<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
possibly do here in a second to show the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.149 
possibly do here in a second to show the
fact<00:02:41.659> that<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.930> could<00:02:42.049> probably<00:02:42.290> put<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.890> in

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
fact that you could probably put this in

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.690 
fact that you could probably put this in
midair<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.870> take<00:02:45.470> long<00:02:45.799> distances<00:02:46.370> about

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
midair and take long distances about

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.910 
midair and take long distances about
having<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.030> need<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.269> mine<00:02:47.450> carts<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.049> it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
having to need of mine carts and it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.500 
having to need of mine carts and it
would<00:02:49.010> be<00:02:49.040> probably<00:02:49.549> much<00:02:49.909> faster<00:02:50.329> because

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
would be probably much faster because

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.699 
would be probably much faster because
you<00:02:50.659> don't<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.079> put<00:02:51.230> on<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.440> powered

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
you don't have to put on the powered

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.259 
you don't have to put on the powered
rails<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.430> don't<00:02:52.579> have<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.790> ignite<00:02:53.090> them

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
rails and you don't have to ignite them

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.670 
rails and you don't have to ignite them
all<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:54.109> just<00:02:54.230> got<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.349> do<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.500> make<00:02:54.650> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
all you just got to do is make a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.970 
all you just got to do is make a
straight<00:02:54.950> line<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.840> diagonal<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.769> just

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
straight line of diagonal and you just

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.530 
straight line of diagonal and you just
put<00:02:58.340> down<00:02:58.430> mine<00:02:58.579> cards<00:02:58.879> push<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.359> you<00:02:59.389> go

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
put down mine cards push and you go

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.020 
put down mine cards push and you go
wherever<00:03:00.379> you<00:03:00.530> want<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.769> go<00:03:00.829> so<00:03:01.340> I'm<00:03:01.760> gonna<00:03:01.879> try

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
wherever you want to go so I'm gonna try

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.490 
wherever you want to go so I'm gonna try
and<00:03:02.180> do<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.299> here<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.629> second<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.109> I'll<00:03:03.409> be

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
and do that here in a second so I'll be

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.479 
and do that here in a second so I'll be
back<00:03:04.569> okay<00:03:05.569> so<00:03:05.629> I<00:03:06.109> just<00:03:06.379> um<00:03:06.590> continued<00:03:07.159> it<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
back okay so I just um continued it and

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.360 
back okay so I just um continued it and
I<00:03:08.389> did<00:03:08.629> built<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.930> elevation<00:03:09.439> and<00:03:09.650> did<00:03:10.099> work

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I did built the elevation and did work

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.280 
I did built the elevation and did work
diagonal<00:03:10.879> so<00:03:11.359> if<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:11.629> content<00:03:12.049> out<00:03:12.170> on

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
diagonal so if you just content out on

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.140 
diagonal so if you just content out on
crack<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:12.980> while<00:03:13.159> I<00:03:13.189> was<00:03:13.370> doing<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.849> fell

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
crack but while I was doing it I fell

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.740 
crack but while I was doing it I fell
off<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.359> track<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:15.079> got<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.280> end<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.609> I<00:03:17.510> ran

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
off my track I got to the end and I ran

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.559 
off my track I got to the end and I ran
over<00:03:17.780> some<00:03:18.109> cows<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:20.150> happened

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
over some cows and this is what happened

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
so we're back and I kind of modified the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.089 
so we're back and I kind of modified the
idea<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.690> little<00:03:57.870> bit<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.650> let's<00:03:58.799> try<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:58.980> figure

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
idea a little bit so let's try to figure

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.759 
idea a little bit so let's try to figure
out<00:03:59.220> how<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.760> control<00:04:00.140> which<00:04:01.140> ways<00:04:01.440> these

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
out how can I control which ways these

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.039 
out how can I control which ways these
things<00:04:02.099> turn<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:02.940> because<00:04:03.180> when<00:04:03.480> i<00:04:03.510> first<00:04:03.810> did

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
things turn so because when i first did

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.839 
things turn so because when i first did
it<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.230> didn't<00:04:04.530> make<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> path<00:04:04.950> pretty<00:04:05.310> wide<00:04:05.579> as

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
it I didn't make the path pretty wide as

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.910 
it I didn't make the path pretty wide as
you<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.000> see<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> wasn't<00:04:07.260> sure<00:04:07.409> how<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.709> was

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you can see so I wasn't sure how I was

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.849 
you can see so I wasn't sure how I was
going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.510> did<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:09.720> once<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.170> state

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
going to go so I did it once and state

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.160 
going to go so I did it once and state
along<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> edge<00:04:11.370> right<00:04:11.640> here<00:04:11.939> perfectly<00:04:12.930> I

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
along the edge right here perfectly I

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.839 
along the edge right here perfectly I
did<00:04:13.379> in<00:04:13.470> our<00:04:13.650> time<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.129> it<00:04:14.280> was<00:04:14.340> over<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.760> the

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
did in our time and it was over in the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.180 
did in our time and it was over in the
middle<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.510> I'm<00:04:16.139> Molly<00:04:16.350> okay<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.859> I'm<00:04:17.039> gonna

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
middle and I'm Molly okay if I'm gonna

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.729 
middle and I'm Molly okay if I'm gonna
make<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.699> convenient<00:04:18.419> easier<00:04:18.810> way<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.289> do

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
make this a convenient easier way to do

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.250 
make this a convenient easier way to do
mine<00:04:20.370> cards<00:04:20.850> then<00:04:21.479> let's<00:04:21.720> say<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> powered

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
mine cards then let's say a powered

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.379 
mine cards then let's say a powered
whale<00:04:22.440> rail<00:04:22.800> system<00:04:23.370> or<00:04:23.580> his<00:04:23.880> minecraft

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
whale rail system or his minecraft

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.320 
whale rail system or his minecraft
tracks<00:04:24.750> lined<00:04:25.289> up<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.760> figured<00:04:26.760> I'd<00:04:26.850> have<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.240> be

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
tracks lined up I figured I'd have to be

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.390 
tracks lined up I figured I'd have to be
a<00:04:27.360> little<00:04:27.510> more<00:04:27.780> creative<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.470> come<00:04:29.100> up<00:04:29.130> with

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
a little more creative and come up with

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.360 
a little more creative and come up with
a<00:04:29.520> very<00:04:29.729> unique<00:04:29.970> idea<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:31.039> what<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.070> came<00:04:32.190> up

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
a very unique idea so what I came up

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.750 
a very unique idea so what I came up
with<00:04:32.490> was<00:04:32.880> blocks<00:04:33.150> two<00:04:33.690> blocks<00:04:34.280> exactly<00:04:35.280> so

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
with was blocks two blocks exactly so

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.010 
with was blocks two blocks exactly so
what<00:04:35.910> happens<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.479> pushes<00:04:36.690> these

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
what happens is when it pushes these

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.469 
what happens is when it pushes these
cars<00:04:37.350> gonna<00:04:37.500> go<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.460> when<00:04:38.880> they<00:04:39.000> hit<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.210> block

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
cars gonna go and when they hit a block

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.020 
cars gonna go and when they hit a block
they<00:04:40.350> go<00:04:40.500> around<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.949> it's<00:04:41.580> pretty<00:04:41.789> cool

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
they go around it it's pretty cool

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.790 
they go around it it's pretty cool
actually<00:04:42.090> go<00:04:42.570> do<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.410> it's<00:04:43.710> really

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
actually go do you do it and it's really

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.920 
actually go do you do it and it's really
cool<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.970> haven't<00:04:45.360> gone<00:04:45.479> all<00:04:45.599> the<00:04:45.690> way<00:04:45.750> off

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
