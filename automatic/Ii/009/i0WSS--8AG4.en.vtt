00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 watches are made of stone watches created 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 for extreme watches that have everything for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.750
 traveling lifestyle so mowed 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.750
 presents the series by g-shock case 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.170
 younger members of the series possess 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 rough but stylish design 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.550
 and such functions as a timer with reverse 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 countdown stopwatch or automatic 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.420
 setting the clock will be useful to all 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.990
 lovers of active life chip all 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.869
 g-shock 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.180
 notorious indestructibility in models j 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 This is done in three ways. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 durability and water tightness 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 resistance to magnetic 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.620
 impact resistance fields achieved 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 thanks to a combination of complete structure 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.700
 shells reducing impact force 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 impact on internal elements and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 special cushioning material 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 which covered the internal parts of the watch 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 additional shockproof protection 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.899
 provides and rubber edging 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.239
 safety buttons and mineral 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.039
 direct impact glass protection degree 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 hours from the water corresponds to the fifth 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.870
 discharge that allows you to dive in depth 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.850
 where the pressure does not exceed 20 bar strap 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.189
 hours of polymer but unlike more 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 prestigious and expensive leather is better 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.000
 tolerate mechanical stress and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.250
 stay underwater watches are equipped 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 magnetic field protection they are always 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 will show the exact time and work 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.450
 without failures even surrounded by large 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.670
 number of electrical appliances design 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 beckys series corresponds to the name 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 large dial and embedded in it 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.970
 parts under thick glass form 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 unusual three-dimensional look by the way 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 the location of all the elements on 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.939
 the dial and the models are different now 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.329
 a bit of theory to sort out 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.759
 models 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.979
 the letters g and this belong to the watch 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.350
 big case series next three digits 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 strap and exterior color model 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 can be determined by the first digit of the third 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 block titles and all remaining letters and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 numbers are color variations 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 display and with a choice of colors problems not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 will be 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.680
 here there is a tone for any clothes not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.509
 the last place is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.399
 model functionality let's 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.710
 look at the quartz dial 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.049
 the mechanism rotates two aluminum arrows 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 there is no figure on the marks 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.069
 customary for sports style models 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.560
 but there are two small digital ones 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.120
 display on the first information about the current 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.150
 of time 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.510
 can set 24 or 12 hour 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.610
 format 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.440
 setting up with the current time is very simple 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.190
 you only need to select the appropriate 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.200
 Timezone 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.569
 and the clock will set the time automatically 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.310
 there is also a world time function 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.989
 at any time you can find out what time it is 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.670
 in a particular city in hours 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.299
 twenty nine o'clock preset 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.459
 belts 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.530
 the second display shows the current 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.420
 the date is also set in these models 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.430
 automatic calendar clock 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.000
 set a daily signal which 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.829
 will serve 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.659
 or an alarm clock or a reminder of 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.660
 important business models have five 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.340
 independent signals embedded 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.599
 stopwatch and countdown timer 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.220
 will be useful during sports 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.890
 workouts with alternating loads 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.900
 or in daily life to measure 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.819
 lengths of time besides using 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.290
 these hours can be measured and average 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.510
 movement speed at a certain 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.170
 distance just do not be lazy to read 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.480
 instruction 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.579
 manage all settings conveniently 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.709
 buttons wide rubberized surface 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.190
 makes it easy to press them even when wet 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.780
 by hands 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.159
 and we really liked 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 automatic backlight is enough 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.120
 turn your hand to yourself and it will turn on 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.400
 also on the dial is applied 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.849
 fluorescent paint that glows in 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.040
 the dark 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.250
 as output we say that the watch is becky 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.260
 g shock stylish and practical models where 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.269
 whatever you were in water on land or 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.519
 even in the air the clock will make you 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.120
 company and their functions will be useful in the most 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.120
 different situations
