00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
your toes but imagine when when maybe a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it's kind of like that well this is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.630 
it's kind of like that well this is
actually<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.740> hardest<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.490> more

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
actually the hardest one here is more

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
actually the hardest one here is more

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
times you will have a case like where

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
times you will have a case like where
they're<00:02:00.020> standing<00:02:00.229> on<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.530> ball<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.830> your

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.820 
they're standing on the ball of your
foot<00:02:01.190> okay<00:02:02.150> what<00:02:02.390> happens<00:02:02.780> there's<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.530> hint

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
foot okay what happens there's is a hint

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.700 
foot okay what happens there's is a hint
of<00:02:03.979> hood<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.119> in<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.390> case<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:06.050> do<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.470> case

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
of hood so in that case you do that case

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.320 
of hood so in that case you do that case
personal<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.280> one<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.580> wish<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.850> show<00:02:08.000> me<00:02:08.060> but

personal the one you wish to show me but

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.870 
personal the one you wish to show me but
that's<00:02:08.540> no<00:02:08.750> basis<00:02:09.610> basically<00:02:10.610> because<00:02:10.670> of

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
that's no basis basically because of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.460 
that's no basis basically because of
what<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.120> communion<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.840> two<00:02:12.020> shapes<00:02:12.320> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
what is communion you have two shapes to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.140 
what is communion you have two shapes to
deal<00:02:14.530> okay<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.590> basically<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.670> go<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
deal okay so basically you go on to the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.110 
deal okay so basically you go on to the
ale<00:02:17.740> but<00:02:18.740> then<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> foot<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.490> engine<00:02:20.000> of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
ale but then the foot is a engine of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.720 
ale but then the foot is a engine of
foot<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> basically<00:02:21.739> would<00:02:22.340> break<00:02:22.550> this

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
foot that it basically would break this

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.130 
foot that it basically would break this
thing<00:02:22.790> I've<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.510> person<00:02:23.810> really

was<00:03:57.889> seasoned<00:03:58.340> non<00:03:58.819> foreshortened<00:03:59.690> like<00:04:00.349> if

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
was seasoned non foreshortened like if

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.690 
was seasoned non foreshortened like if
you're<00:04:00.560> looking<00:04:00.769> at<00:04:00.829> straight<00:04:01.159> from<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.459> side

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
you're looking at straight from the side

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.550 
you're looking at straight from the side
what<00:04:01.940> you're<00:04:02.030> going<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.239> see<00:04:02.450> which<00:04:03.109> should

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
what you're going to see which should

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.199 
what you're going to see which should
just<00:04:03.769> kind<00:04:03.889> of<00:04:03.980> be<00:04:04.129> like<00:04:04.280> almost<00:04:04.700> like<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.909> hand

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
just kind of be like almost like a hand

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.160 
just kind of be like almost like a hand
I<00:04:05.389> think<00:04:05.420> that's<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:06.549> yes<00:04:07.810> yeah<00:04:08.810> except<00:04:09.139> for

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
I think that's it yes yeah except for

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.170 
I think that's it yes yeah except for
the<00:04:09.349> foots<00:04:09.650> pointed<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:10.700> we're<00:04:10.849> point<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
the foots pointed so we're point the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.090 
the foots pointed so we're point the
foot<00:04:13.090> left<00:04:14.090> yes<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.260> got<00:04:15.349> too<00:04:15.500> much<00:04:15.530> operate

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
foot left yes you got too much operate

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.080 
foot left yes you got too much operate
between<00:04:17.470> dad<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.979> make<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.430> angle<00:04:20.000> of

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
between dad make the make the angle of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.089 
between dad make the make the angle of
incidence<00:04:20.180> between<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.229> ankle<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
incidence between the the ankle and the

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.879 
incidence between the the ankle and the
the<00:04:22.639> leg<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.410> close<00:04:24.410> two<00:04:24.590> hundred<00:04:24.860> eighty

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
the leg is close two hundred eighty

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.760 
the leg is close two hundred eighty
degrees<00:04:24.979> as<00:04:25.340> possible<00:04:26.740> ok<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:29.590> that's<00:04:30.590> what

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
degrees as possible ok so that's what

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.310 
degrees as possible ok so that's what
that's<00:04:31.310> what<00:04:31.370> he's<00:04:31.520> tired<00:04:32.110> alleged<00:04:33.110> is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
that's what he's tired alleged is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.890 
that's what he's tired alleged is
basically<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.539> shape<00:04:35.750> is

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
basically this and the shape is

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.890 
basically this and the shape is
essentially<00:04:36.349> triangle<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.889> looks<00:04:37.039> like<00:04:37.220> that

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
essentially triangle it looks like that

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.230 
essentially triangle it looks like that
ok<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.410> got<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.560> heel<00:04:39.830> mom<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.909> got<00:04:41.090> the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
ok and you got the heel mom you got the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.610 
ok and you got the heel mom you got the
heel<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.659> then<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.930> fluid<00:04:42.080> rolling<00:04:42.620> over<00:04:47.620> why

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
heel and then the fluid rolling over why

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.040 
heel and then the fluid rolling over why
no<00:04:49.340> no<00:04:49.520> he's<00:04:49.820> got<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.120> right<00:04:50.300> he's<00:04:50.720> got<00:04:50.930> it

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
no no he's got it right he's got it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.810 
no no he's got it right he's got it
right<00:04:51.229> he's<00:04:51.800> got<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.070> lean<00:04:52.190> over<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.610> mean<00:04:52.760> this

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
right he's got to lean over I mean this

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.760 
right he's got to lean over I mean this
is<00:04:52.880> 34<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.810> small<00:04:54.050> time<00:04:54.289> would<00:04:54.409> be<00:04:54.440> here

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
is 34 so the small time would be here

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.800 
is 34 so the small time would be here
then<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.460> have<00:04:55.490> one<00:04:55.760> two<00:04:55.940> three<00:04:55.970> four<00:04:56.570> big

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
then you have one two three four big

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.390 
then you have one two three four big
deal<00:04:57.169> you're<00:04:57.380> like<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.740> usually<00:04:57.889> sticking

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
deal you're like that usually sticking

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.279 
deal you're like that usually sticking
out<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.330> you'd<00:04:59.479> actually<00:04:59.630> see<00:04:59.840> some<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.139> the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
out and you'd actually see some of the

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.100 
out and you'd actually see some of the
underpass<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:01.550> see<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:01.729> think<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:02.479> is<00:05:02.659> the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
underpass you see I think this is the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.990 
underpass you see I think this is the
spike<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.650> seem<00:05:03.830> really<00:05:04.039> easy<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.340> Dan<00:05:04.580> but

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
spike to seem really easy to Dan but

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.380 
spike to seem really easy to Dan but
seems<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.510> hard<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.780> some<00:05:05.930> other<00:05:06.050> people
