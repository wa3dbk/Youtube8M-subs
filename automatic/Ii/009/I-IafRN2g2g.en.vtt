00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
block the aperture blades so that you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.950 
block the aperture blades so that you
get<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.010> wider<00:00:08.340> depth<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.820> field<00:00:09.059> when<00:00:09.840> you're

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.260 
take a picture and show you the very
shallow<00:00:18.869> depth<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> field<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.150> an

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
shallow depth of field so you can get an

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.120 
shallow depth of field so you can get an
idea<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.109> actually<00:00:22.320> gain<00:00:22.769> by<00:00:23.100> doing

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
idea of what you actually gain by doing
