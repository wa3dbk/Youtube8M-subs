the poet and driver must thought it was

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.880 
the poet and driver must thought it was
crazy<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.129> I<00:02:40.520> found<00:02:41.450> there's<00:02:42.349> two

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
crazy but I found there's two

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.410 
crazy but I found there's two
photographs<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.610> are<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.849> quite<00:02:44.090> blue

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
photographs that are the quite blue

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.369 
photographs that are the quite blue
photographs<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:46.550> you<00:02:46.670> can<00:02:46.879> see<00:02:47.379> the

surface the deep sound is so deep that
you<00:03:09.830> can<00:03:09.920> hardly<00:03:10.160> hear<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:12.069> but<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.160> know<00:03:13.310> it's

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
you can hardly hear it but you know it's

you can hardly hear it but you know it's
underneath<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.090> water<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.910> a

it's 3 degrees and I mean Yorkshire and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.379 
it's 3 degrees and I mean Yorkshire and
it's<00:03:44.930> where<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.139> shivered<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:45.920> chatter<00:03:46.269> but<00:03:47.269> in

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
it's where I shivered and chatter but in

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.750 
it's where I shivered and chatter but in
the<00:03:47.480> Arctic<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.019> can<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.260> minus<00:03:48.560> 35<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.340> do

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the Arctic it can be minus 35 and I do

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.210 
the Arctic it can be minus 35 and I do
you<00:03:49.850> feel<00:03:50.000> fine<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.630> what<00:03:51.590> does<00:03:51.799> happen<00:03:51.920> is

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
you feel fine but what does happen is

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.110 
you feel fine but what does happen is
you<00:03:52.579> have<00:03:52.609> these<00:03:53.230> swirling<00:03:54.230> winds<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:55.579> diamond

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
you have these swirling winds of diamond

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.180 
you have these swirling winds of diamond
dust<00:03:56.329> so<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:56.959> get<00:03:57.230> these<00:03:57.410> rainbows

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
dust so you get these rainbows

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.879 
dust so you get these rainbows
refracting<00:03:59.000> everywhere<00:03:59.540> it's<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.620> very

cleans your plate somehow your your

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
visual sense gets kind of sharpened

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.840 
visual sense gets kind of sharpened
somehow<00:04:14.630> by<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.900> infant<00:04:15.470> infinite<00:04:16.310> quality

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
somehow by the infant infinite quality

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.149 
somehow by the infant infinite quality
of<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.389> space

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
of the space

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.459 
of the space
if<00:04:20.159> I<00:04:20.310> would<00:04:20.459> imagine<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.909> as<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> painting<00:04:21.539> it

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
if I would imagine it as a painting it

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.689 
if I would imagine it as a painting it
would<00:04:22.650> be<00:04:23.030> some<00:04:24.030> dark<00:04:25.069> colors<00:04:26.069> and<00:04:26.249> at<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
would be some dark colors and at the

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.360 
would be some dark colors and at the
bottom<00:04:27.409> moving<00:04:28.409> like<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.229> down<00:04:31.409> in<00:04:31.889> curves

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
bottom moving like up and down in curves

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.589 
bottom moving like up and down in curves
and<00:04:32.840> then<00:04:33.840> at<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.169> very<00:04:34.199> top<00:04:34.499> some<00:04:34.979> dots<00:04:37.189> and

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
and then at the very top some dots and

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.700 
and then at the very top some dots and
then<00:04:39.599> in<00:04:39.719> the<00:04:39.810> middle<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.110> have<00:04:40.199> like<00:04:40.529> this

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
then in the middle you have like this

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.249 
then in the middle you have like this
void<00:04:40.979> maybe<00:04:41.370> it's<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.849> bit<00:04:42.120> gray<00:04:42.419> but<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.020> all

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
void maybe it's a bit gray but it's all

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.719 
void maybe it's a bit gray but it's all
black<00:04:43.499> and<00:04:43.529> white<00:04:43.710> it's<00:04:44.009> like<00:04:44.099> different

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
black and white it's like different

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.089 
black and white it's like different
shades<00:04:44.999> of<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.509> that<00:04:46.349> no<00:04:46.710> color<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:49.800> almost

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
shades of of that no color it's almost

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.279 
shades of of that no color it's almost
like<00:04:50.870> like<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.930> Rothko<00:04:52.699> painting<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.960> more<00:04:55.110> you

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
like like a Rothko painting the more you

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.029 
like like a Rothko painting the more you
stare<00:04:55.650> at<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.580> more<00:04:56.819> things<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:58.039> yet

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
stare at it the more things you see yet

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.700 
stare at it the more things you see yet
it's<00:04:59.279> just<00:04:59.580> like<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.819> kind<00:05:00.689> of<00:05:00.779> monochrome<00:05:03.710> you

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
it's just like a kind of monochrome you

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.929 
it's just like a kind of monochrome you
don't<00:05:04.919> know<00:05:05.009> whether<00:05:05.159> you're<00:05:05.340> looking<00:05:05.610> into<00:05:05.789> a

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:05.939 
don't know whether you're looking into a

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.719 
don't know whether you're looking into a
sand<00:05:06.300> escape<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:07.020> desert<00:05:07.439> or<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.830> no<00:05:08.039> escape<00:05:08.460> so

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
sand escape a desert or is no escape so

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.540 
sand escape a desert or is no escape so
they<00:05:09.529> they<00:05:10.529> can<00:05:10.770> they<00:05:10.949> leave<00:05:11.159> the<00:05:11.339> page

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
they they can they leave the page

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.179 
they they can they leave the page
somehow<00:05:12.210> there<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.319> then<00:05:13.800> they<00:05:13.949> have<00:05:14.069> this

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
somehow there and then they have this

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.179 
somehow there and then they have this
beautiful<00:05:14.610> kind<00:05:14.969> of<00:05:15.089> this<00:05:15.740> monochrome<00:05:16.740> feel

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:17.189 
beautiful kind of this monochrome feel

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.029 
beautiful kind of this monochrome feel
and<00:05:17.550> very<00:05:18.180> subtle<00:05:18.509> shifts<00:05:19.169> of<00:05:19.319> color<00:05:19.589> would

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
and very subtle shifts of color would

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.790 
and very subtle shifts of color would
take<00:05:20.249> place<00:05:20.490> but<00:05:21.360> your<00:05:21.509> sense<00:05:21.839> is<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.080> super

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
take place but your sense is a super

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.559 
take place but your sense is a super
heightened<00:05:23.520> when<00:05:23.759> you're<00:05:23.939> there<00:05:24.089> because

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
heightened when you're there because

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.610 
heightened when you're there because
everything<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.889> rigid<00:05:26.430> your<00:05:26.610> diet<00:05:26.939> is<00:05:27.620> a

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
everything is rigid your diet is a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.269 
everything is rigid your diet is a
minimal<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:29.870> everything<00:05:30.870> is<00:05:31.080> an<00:05:31.710> experience

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
minimal so everything is an experience

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.409 
minimal so everything is an experience
