all over here in a small greenhouse and
I'm<00:01:15.570> making<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> adjustments<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> them<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310

make<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.200> for

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
make them where I can use it for

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
make them where I can use it for
hydroponics<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
hydroponics and I think it's going to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.060 
hydroponics and I think it's going to
work<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.689> good<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.229> talked<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> little

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
got nine early Jersey Wakefield cabbage

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
got nine early Jersey Wakefield cabbage
and<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> notice<00:01:34.560> I've<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.549> spaced

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and if you notice I've got them spaced

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
and if you notice I've got them spaced
out<00:01:36.090> pretty<00:01:36.390> good<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.380> hard<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.979> me<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
out pretty good this was hard for me to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.569 
out pretty good this was hard for me to
do<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> plants<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.979> small<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
do because the plants was so small it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
do because the plants was so small it
looks<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.150> much<00:01:42.270> empty<00:01:42.630> space<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.110> there

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
looks like so much empty space in there

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
looks like so much empty space in there
and<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.070> wanted<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and I really really wanted to put a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
and I really really wanted to put a
whole<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:45.930> plants<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.340> have

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
whole lot more plants in it but I have

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
whole lot more plants in it but I have
seen<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.360> cabbage<00:01:48.810> before<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> past<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
seen these cabbage before in the past I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.960 
seen these cabbage before in the past I
know<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.520> big<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.649> nine<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.340> still

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
know how big they get nine in here still

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
know how big they get nine in here still
might<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.390> too<00:01:54.600> many<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.110> we'll<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
might be too many but we'll see how it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.389 
might be too many but we'll see how it
goes

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
goes

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
goes
these<00:01:56.759> were<00:01:56.969> put<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.270> place<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:58.200> four<00:01:58.740> or

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
these were put in place about four or

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
these were put in place about four or
five<00:01:59.070> days<00:01:59.369> ago<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.570> right<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
five days ago and this one right here I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.770 
five days ago and this one right here I
made<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> mistake<00:02:01.920> when<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> originally<00:02:03.119> cut<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
made a mistake when I originally cut it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060 
made a mistake when I originally cut it
it<00:02:04.110> would<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.320> been<00:02:04.409> okay<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.799> an

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it would have been okay for an

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180 
it would have been okay for an
aquaponics<00:02:05.700> grow<00:02:05.850> bed<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.600> having<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.190> liner

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
aquaponics grow bed but having my liner

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.729 
aquaponics grow bed but having my liner
so<00:02:08.610> far<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:09.720> neck<00:02:09.959> cups<00:02:10.259> couldn't<00:02:10.590> reach

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
so far down my neck cups couldn't reach

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
so far down my neck cups couldn't reach
it<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.430> didn't<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.270> raising<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it and I didn't think about raising the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.970 
it and I didn't think about raising the
plastic<00:02:13.290> tub<00:02:13.500> up

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
plastic tub up

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.500 
plastic tub up
and<00:02:14.069> putting<00:02:14.370> some<00:02:14.580> boards<00:02:14.879> up<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> until

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and putting some boards up on it until

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.140 
and putting some boards up on it until
after<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.530> had<00:02:16.920> already<00:02:17.129> riveted<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.819> one<00:02:18.000> in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
after I had already riveted this one in

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.789 
after I had already riveted this one in
place<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:18.870> went<00:02:19.170> ahead<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.470> cut<00:02:19.650> my

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
place so I went ahead and cut my

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.740 
place so I went ahead and cut my
styrofoam<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.610> bit<00:02:20.700> smaller<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.269> we're

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
styrofoam a little bit smaller and we're

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.000 
styrofoam a little bit smaller and we're
just<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.110> make<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.379> on<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.620> floating

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
just going to make this on the floating

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
just going to make this on the floating
raft<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.909> have<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.390> air<00:02:24.510> bubbles<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.049> in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
raft I do have the air bubbles up in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.559 
raft I do have the air bubbles up in
there<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.519> aggressive<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.269> went

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
there and you see how aggressive I went

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.030 
there and you see how aggressive I went
with<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.080> spacing<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.650> this

here in the greenhouse all I do is just
take<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.220> rockwool<00:02:44.670> cubes<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.290> separate

things that you've started for an
hydroponic<00:02:53.910> setup<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.510> putting<00:02:54.840> them<00:02:54.959> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
hydroponic setup and putting them in

hydroponic setup and putting them in
ground<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:55.980> okay<00:02:56.280> yes<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.180> okay<00:02:57.599> it

already got my cabbage bok choy in place
and<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.959> stuff<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.410> ground<00:03:25.819> I'm<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:27.060> to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
most of it it will still be okay it's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.939 
most of it it will still be okay it's
just<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:35.090> regular<00:04:35.630> bare<00:04:35.870> root<00:04:36.169> transplant<00:04:36.770> what

just a regular bare root transplant what

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.070 
just a regular bare root transplant what
it<00:04:37.040> becomes<00:04:37.310> preferably<00:04:38.270> you'd<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.870> have

it becomes preferably you'd like to have
some<00:04:39.350> smaller<00:04:39.740> transplants<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.760> what<00:04:40.880> I'm

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
some smaller transplants and what I'm

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.030
