00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.529 
on Monday but I didn't want to just make
like<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.770> phone<00:00:42.129> at<00:00:42.309> in<00:00:42.460> video<00:00:42.910> you<00:00:43.270> know<00:00:43.390> just

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
failed because of the perfectionism

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.500 
failed because of the perfectionism
thing<00:02:29.330> again<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:30.400> never<00:02:31.400> got<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.910> place<00:02:32.060> that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

everything kind of like can mix and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.150 
everything kind of like can mix and
match<00:03:10.970> ball<00:03:11.300> two<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.590> love<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.830> concept

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
match ball two and I love that concept

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.910 
match ball two and I love that concept
so<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.060> think<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> most<00:03:14.780> popular<00:03:15.320> one<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.739> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so I think the most popular one is the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.229 
so I think the most popular one is the
project<00:03:16.400> 333<00:03:17.390> where<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.920> have<00:03:19.040> 33<00:03:19.670> items<00:03:19.850> of

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
project 333 where you have 33 items of

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.210 
project 333 where you have 33 items of
clothing<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.050> I<00:03:21.200> think<00:03:21.380> shoes<00:03:21.590> are<00:03:21.739> included

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
clothing and I think shoes are included

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.890 
clothing and I think shoes are included
and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.670> wear<00:03:22.850> them<00:03:23.060> for<00:03:23.090> three<00:03:23.540> months

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and then you wear them for three months

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.259 
and then you wear them for three months
you<00:03:24.769> know<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.130> typical<00:03:25.370> season<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.180> then

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
you know like a typical season and then

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.729 
you know like a typical season and then
you<00:03:26.390> can<00:03:26.540> kind<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.840> switch<00:03:27.110> things<00:03:27.350> up<00:03:27.530> from

do but um I feel like a lot of times

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.790 
do but um I feel like a lot of times
when<00:05:38.610> we<00:05:38.760> can't<00:05:39.060> produce<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:40.020> much<00:05:40.229> more<00:05:40.530> ways

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
when we can't produce so much more ways

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.760 
when we can't produce so much more ways
than<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.820> know<00:05:41.850> even<00:05:42.300> we<00:05:42.630> do<00:05:42.840> when<00:05:43.500> we're<00:05:43.680> at

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
than you know even we do when we're at

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.830 
than you know even we do when we're at
home<00:05:43.800> because<00:05:44.130> we're<00:05:44.460> buying<00:05:44.669> like<00:05:45.030> that<00:05:45.630> to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
home because we're buying like that to

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.070 
home because we're buying like that to
go<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:47.400> know<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.639> oatmeal<00:05:48.060> containers<00:05:48.720> and

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
go you know the oatmeal containers and

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.960 
go you know the oatmeal containers and
package<00:05:49.470> this<00:05:49.740> package<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.310> too<00:05:50.699> just<00:05:50.820> like

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
package this package that too just like

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.870 
package this package that too just like
make<00:05:51.240> things<00:05:51.449> easy<00:05:51.750> but<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.530> think<00:05:52.919> like<00:05:53.430> we

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
make things easy but I think like we

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.590 
make things easy but I think like we
could<00:05:54.030> do<00:05:54.300> easy<00:05:54.990> food<00:05:55.740> that's<00:05:56.580> just<00:05:56.850> like<00:05:57.090> not

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
could do easy food that's just like not

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.360 
could do easy food that's just like not
you<00:05:58.139> know<00:05:58.260> stuff<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:58.740> we<00:05:59.010> make<00:05:59.220> ourselves

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
you know stuff that we make ourselves

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.159 
you know stuff that we make ourselves
and<00:05:59.940> just<00:05:59.970> like<00:06:00.210> packaged<00:06:00.660> in<00:06:00.810> glass

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
and just like packaged in glass

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.830 
and just like packaged in glass
containers<00:06:01.380> or<00:06:01.740> whatever<00:06:02.100> so<00:06:02.850> yeah<00:06:03.540> I<00:06:03.570> think

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
containers or whatever so yeah I think

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.820 
containers or whatever so yeah I think
that'll<00:06:04.290> be<00:06:04.410> an<00:06:04.530> interesting<00:06:04.860> concept<00:06:05.340> um<00:06:06.830> if

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
that'll be an interesting concept um if

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.500 
that'll be an interesting concept um if
we<00:06:08.010> don't<00:06:08.190> end<00:06:08.400> up<00:06:08.580> doing<00:06:08.820> that<00:06:08.970> I'll<00:06:09.210> probably

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
we don't end up doing that I'll probably

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.930 
we don't end up doing that I'll probably
do<00:06:10.139> just<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.740> are<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:11.039> somebody<00:06:11.280> packing
