Kelly Kettle stoves and these really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099 
Kelly Kettle stoves and these really
have<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> unique<00:00:20.490> design<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.269> I<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
have a unique design to them I have the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.939 
have a unique design to them I have the
fire<00:00:22.349> pan<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.900> it's<00:00:24.900> got<00:00:25.080> holes<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.710> can

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
fire pan and it's got holes so you can

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
fire pan and it's got holes so you can
aim<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.310> towards<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.910> wind<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.449> away<00:00:27.839> from

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
aim that towards your wind or away from

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.499 
aim that towards your wind or away from
it<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.410> control<00:00:28.769> how<00:00:29.640> hot<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:30.029> fire<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.240> going

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
it to control how hot your fire is going

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.780 
it to control how hot your fire is going
to<00:00:30.570> burn<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> kettle

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
to burn and then you have the kettle

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.530 
to burn and then you have the kettle
that<00:00:33.270> goes<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.140> kettle<00:00:34.590> has<00:00:35.580> its

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that goes on top and kettle has its

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
that goes on top and kettle has its
double<00:00:37.020> walled<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.039> chimney<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.789> can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
double walled so it's a chimney you can

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.799 
double walled so it's a chimney you can
see<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.300> through<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.579> but<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> outside

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
see right through it but the outside

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.770 
see right through it but the outside
wall<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> inside<00:00:44.250> wall<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.780> spaced

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
wall and the inside wall are spaced

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
wall and the inside wall are spaced
apart<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.980> holds<00:00:47.129> water<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.789> between

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
apart so that it holds water in between

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
apart so that it holds water in between
the<00:00:48.329> walls<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:49.949> fill<00:00:50.129> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the walls so we are going to fill this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.000 
the walls so we are going to fill this
up<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> filled<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.600> fire<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.649> see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
it has a stopper for it and to stop up

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.430 
it has a stopper for it and to stop up

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
want a good amount of water so we can
have<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> explode<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.200> over<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.740> boils

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
have it explode all over when it boils

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
have it explode all over when it boils
right<00:01:20.280> hey<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:21.240> want<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> way

right hey you don't want it all the way

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
right hey you don't want it all the way
to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> top<00:01:22.079> it<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.920> spill<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.280> as

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to the top it will kind of spill out as

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
to the top it will kind of spill out as
a<00:01:23.490> boil<00:01:23.759> okay<00:01:24.509> once<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.840> fires<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
fire pan and then you put your chimney

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
fire pan and then you put your chimney
on<00:01:29.840> don't<00:01:30.840> melt<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.200> stopper<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
on don't melt your stopper and you can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.340 
on don't melt your stopper and you can
feed<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> fire<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.649> through<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> top<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:42.350> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
feed the fire now through the top of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
feed the fire now through the top of the
kettle<00:01:46.939> maybe<00:01:47.939> edge<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> killing<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
kettle maybe edge to the killing it all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.420 
kettle maybe edge to the killing it all
over<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> other<00:01:50.540> biomass<00:01:51.540> stove

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
over some of the other biomass stove

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.730 
over some of the other biomass stove
is<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.600> can<00:01:53.780> use<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> fairly<00:01:54.380> good-sized

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
is that you can use a fairly good-sized

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.070 
is that you can use a fairly good-sized
dip<00:01:55.130> some<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.210> stoves<00:01:56.480> are<00:01:56.660> kind<00:01:56.870> of<00:01:56.900> small

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
dip some of the stoves are kind of small

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.070 
dip some of the stoves are kind of small
and<00:01:57.880> because<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.120> height<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.810> one

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
and because of the height of this one

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.200 
and because of the height of this one
you<00:02:00.920> can<00:02:00.950> put<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> pretty<00:02:01.490> good<00:02:01.610> night<00:02:01.790> stick<00:02:02.060> in

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
you can put a pretty good night stick in

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:30.580 
you can put a pretty good night stick in
there<00:02:28.600> because<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.810> double<00:02:30.080> wall<00:02:30.230> design

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
there because of the double wall design

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.140 
there because of the double wall design
of<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> heat<00:02:31.550> that's<00:02:31.730> coming<00:02:31.820> up

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
of this and the heat that's coming up

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790 
of this and the heat that's coming up
the<00:02:32.270> chimney<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.810> water<00:02:33.050> actually<00:02:33.410> burns

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the chimney the water actually burns

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.430 
the chimney the water actually burns
boils<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.239> quickly<00:02:35.630> water<00:02:35.900> doesn't<00:02:36.080> burn

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
boils really quickly water doesn't burn

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.260 
boils really quickly water doesn't burn
water<00:02:37.340> boils<00:02:37.850> really<00:02:38.180> fast<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.910> also<00:02:44.090> have<00:02:44.510> a

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
water boils really fast they also have a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.110 
water boils really fast they also have a
kid<00:02:47.270> where<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:48.580> put<00:02:49.580> together<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
kid where you can put together the
