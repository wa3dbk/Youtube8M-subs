00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
digital camera changed accordingly most

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160 
digital camera changed accordingly most
of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:40.049> the

even cloudy cloudy the cloudy setting
tends<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.489> be<00:02:18.579> pretty<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:19.079> good<00:02:20.079> advice<00:02:21.689> also

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
tends to be pretty good good advice also

you're<00:02:35.439> already<00:02:35.680> standing<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:37.150> maybe

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you're already standing up and maybe

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.960 
you're already standing up and maybe
having<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.049> camera<00:02:38.260> looking<00:02:38.439> down<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:38.980> but

having a camera looking down on it but
the<00:02:40.090> camera<00:02:40.359> would<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.540> directly<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.500> line

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the camera would be directly in line

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.229 
the camera would be directly in line
with<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:42.220> center<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.609> picture<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.120> that

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
with the center of the picture so that

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.729 
with the center of the picture so that
the<00:02:43.329> kit<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.689> your<00:02:43.840> paintings<00:02:44.170> not<00:02:44.319> tilted

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
the kit so your paintings not tilted

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.280 
the kit so your paintings not tilted
compared<00:02:45.129> to<00:02:45.189> where<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.430> are<00:02:46.230> angles<00:02:47.230> are

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
compared to where you are angles are

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.140 
compared to where you are angles are
very<00:02:47.470> important<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.400> when<00:02:48.760> you're<00:02:48.849> ready<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
very important and when you're ready to

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.179 
very important and when you're ready to
take<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> shot<00:02:49.629> it's<00:02:50.470> very<00:02:50.680> common<00:02:50.950> for<00:02:50.980> people

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
take a shot it's very common for people

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.119 
take a shot it's very common for people
to<00:02:51.340> stand<00:02:51.669> as<00:02:51.970> close<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.359> they<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.129> have

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
to stand as close as they can and have

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.640 
to stand as close as they can and have
the<00:02:54.250> zoom<00:02:54.489> zoomed<00:02:55.209> out<00:02:55.389> so<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.349> tends<00:02:56.560> to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the zoom zoomed out so it tends to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.530 
the zoom zoomed out so it tends to
fisheye<00:02:57.340> create<00:02:57.909> a<00:02:57.939> bit<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.239> sort<00:02:58.419> of<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
fisheye create a bit of a sort of a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.759 
fisheye create a bit of a sort of a
bowing<00:02:58.840> effect<00:02:59.109> on<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.319> edges<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
bowing effect on the edges of the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.649 
bowing effect on the edges of the
picture<00:02:59.919> so<00:03:00.579> when<00:03:00.700> you've<00:03:00.819> got<00:03:00.849> got<00:03:01.389> really

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
picture so when you've got got really

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.159 
picture so when you've got got really
take<00:03:01.959> just<00:03:02.680> one<00:03:02.889> step<00:03:03.189> back<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.780> use<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> zoom

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
take just one step back and use the zoom

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.960 
take just one step back and use the zoom
of<00:03:05.319> your<00:03:05.470> camera<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.220> zoom<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.609> little<00:03:06.730> bit

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
of your camera to zoom in a little bit

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.360 
of your camera to zoom in a little bit
to<00:03:07.299> square<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> picture<00:03:08.169> up<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.500> make<00:03:09.129> sure

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
to square the picture up and make sure

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.300 
to square the picture up and make sure
on<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.239> your<00:03:10.299> viewfinder<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.530> your

on the on your viewfinder that your

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.069 
on the on your viewfinder that your
paintings<00:03:12.730> nice<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.239> square<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:13.989> a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
better to set it up sitting on a desk or

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.280

against the camera and holding it still

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.010 
against the camera and holding it still
is<00:04:46.650> much<00:04:47.650> much<00:04:47.979> better<00:04:48.250> than<00:04:48.720> using<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.810> flesh

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
is much much better than using the flesh

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.719 
is much much better than using the flesh
on<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:50.229> camera<00:04:50.470> right<00:04:50.949> never<00:04:51.400> had<00:04:51.520> much<00:04:51.699> luck

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
on a camera right never had much luck
