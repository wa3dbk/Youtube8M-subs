lighting is going to be clamshell we're
going<00:02:01.489> to<00:02:01.549> position<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.689> lights<00:02:03.159> at<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.279> same

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
going to position the lights at the same

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.370 
going to position the lights at the same
distance<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.270> same<00:02:05.479> angle<00:02:05.869> on<00:02:05.989> both

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
distance and the same angle on both

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.889 
distance and the same angle on both
sides<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:07.279> her<00:02:07.700> face<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.569> going<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> give

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
sides of her face this is going to give

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.229 
sides of her face this is going to give
us<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.050> really<00:02:09.349> nice<00:02:09.739> even<00:02:10.099> lighting<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:11.180> is

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
us a really nice even lighting this is

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.670 
us a really nice even lighting this is
often<00:02:11.420> called<00:02:11.540> Hollywood<00:02:12.200> lighting<00:02:12.560> or

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
often called Hollywood lighting or

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.590 
often called Hollywood lighting or
clamshell<00:02:13.220> lighting<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:14.210> good<00:02:14.360> for

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
clamshell lighting it's very good for

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.140 
clamshell lighting it's very good for
portrait<00:02:15.020> work<00:02:15.200> or<00:02:15.410> for<00:02:16.070> glamour<00:02:16.370> work

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
portrait work or for glamour work

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.149 
portrait work or for glamour work
so<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.349> make<00:02:18.470> sure<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> have<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
so I'm going to make sure I have the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.309 
so I'm going to make sure I have the
lights<00:02:19.430> set<00:02:19.640> at<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.849> same<00:02:20.120> power<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.019> this<00:02:21.170> one

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
lights set at the same power so this one

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.229 
lights set at the same power so this one
is<00:02:21.409> on<00:02:21.500> half<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.159> leave<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.340> I'm

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
is on half I'm going to leave that I'm

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.850 
is on half I'm going to leave that I'm
going<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.390> come<00:02:23.510> over<00:02:23.569> here<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.590> I'm<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.799> to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
going to come over here and I'm going to

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.869 
going to come over here and I'm going to
adjust<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.400> one<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.690> half<00:02:27.760> grab<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
adjust this one up to half grab the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:35.640 
adjust this one up to half grab the
camera<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.420> let's<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.379> a<00:02:30.409> little<00:02:30.590> shooting

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.020 

okay<00:02:36.650> now<00:02:37.370> remember<00:02:37.519> I'm<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:38.000> a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
okay now remember I'm going to be a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.460 
okay now remember I'm going to be a
little<00:02:38.269> brighter<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.959> had<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> pump

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
little brighter because I had to pump

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.180 
little brighter because I had to pump
this<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.829> so<00:02:40.069> I'm<00:02:40.159> going<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.310> open<00:02:41.319> my<00:02:42.319> or<00:02:42.920> close

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
this up so I'm going to open my or close

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.449 
this up so I'm going to open my or close
down<00:02:43.220> my<00:02:43.430> aperture<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.269> bit<00:02:45.459> that'll

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
down my aperture a little bit that'll

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.979 
down my aperture a little bit that'll
kill<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.730> light<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.329> strobes<00:02:47.659> a<00:02:47.810> little

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
kill the light from the strobes a little

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.680 
kill the light from the strobes a little
bit<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.319> real<00:02:49.280> quick<00:02:49.609> I<00:02:49.819> was<00:02:50.239> able<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.510> get<00:02:50.599> a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
bit and real quick I was able to get a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.539 
bit and real quick I was able to get a
really<00:02:51.049> good<00:02:51.170> shot<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.310> clamshell

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
really good shot with the clamshell

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.020 
really good shot with the clamshell
lighting<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.900> that's<00:02:54.049> two<00:02:54.769> common<00:02:55.609> ways<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
lighting so that's two common ways of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420 
lighting so that's two common ways of
using<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.540> two<00:02:56.750> light<00:02:57.019> setup<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.650> being<00:02:58.340> able

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
using a two light setup and being able

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.009 
using a two light setup and being able
to<00:02:58.549> bring<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:58.940> reflector<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.720> add<00:02:59.870> that

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
to bring in that reflector to add that

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.500 
to bring in that reflector to add that
hair<00:03:00.290> light
