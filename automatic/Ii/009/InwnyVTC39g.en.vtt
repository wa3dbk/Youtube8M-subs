00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the bad physics the animations dictating

gameplay things we were sold not just a

gameplay things we were sold not just a

mad 15 but with madden 25 next-gen that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
mad 15 but with madden 25 next-gen that
would<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.430> remove<00:00:36.030> themselves<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
would really remove themselves from the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.299 
would really remove themselves from the
game<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.350> terms<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> clipping<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
game in terms of the clipping in the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.160 
game in terms of the clipping in the
warping<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.360> me<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.899> great

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
warping and to me I think we have great

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
warping and to me I think we have great
examples<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> why<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.399> still<00:00:41.700> impact

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
examples here of why they still impact

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.450 
examples here of why they still impact
gameplay<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> very<00:00:42.930> negative<00:00:43.140> way<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:44.160> when

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
gameplay in a very negative way now when

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
gameplay in a very negative way now when
this<00:00:44.550> pass<00:00:44.850> gets<00:00:45.120> thrown<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this pass gets thrown I want you to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
this pass gets thrown I want you to
notice<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> interception<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.879> made<00:00:48.480> by

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
notice the interception here is made by

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600 
notice the interception here is made by
the<00:00:48.719> linebacker<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.530> notice<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the linebacker but notice that the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
the linebacker but notice that the
receivers<00:00:51.149> arms<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> hands<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.530> my

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
receivers arms and hands go through my

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
receivers arms and hands go through my
body<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> game<00:00:54.420> actually

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
body so what is the game actually

registering<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> mean<00:00:55.739> who<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.070> actually

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
registering here I mean who was actually

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
getting this catch is it me because I'm

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
getting this catch is it me because I'm
in<00:00:59.160> front<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> him<00:01:00.570> because

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
in front of them or is it him because

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
in front of them or is it him because
its<00:01:01.050> hands<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.410> through<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.680> body<00:01:01.890> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
its hands are through my body but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
its hands are through my body but
regardless<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> next-gen<00:01:03.570> console<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
regardless on a next-gen console is this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410 
regardless on a next-gen console is this
a<00:01:04.530> decision<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.220> should<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.549> talking<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
a decision we should be talking about I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
a decision we should be talking about I
mean<00:01:06.720> should<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> game<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.409> understand<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
mean should the game not understand and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
mean should the game not understand and
respect<00:01:08.880> positioning<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.810> better

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
respect positioning a little bit better

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
respect positioning a little bit better
you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> problem<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.790> back

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you know the problem is when you go back

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
you know the problem is when you go back
and<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> take<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> linebacker

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and you take a look when the linebacker

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
and you take a look when the linebacker
drives<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> past<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.900> too

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
drives on this past it's really way too

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
drives on this past it's really way too
early<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.500> mean<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> fact<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> he

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
early I mean I like the fact that he

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
early I mean I like the fact that he
goes<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> he's<00:01:18.689> aggressive<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> ball<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
goes and he's aggressive to the ball but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
goes and he's aggressive to the ball but
the<00:01:20.130> fact<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> matter<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.090> game

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the fact of the matter is in this game

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
the fact of the matter is in this game
traditionally<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> defense<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:23.070> more

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
traditionally the defense is a lot more

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
traditionally the defense is a lot more
aggressive<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> past<00:01:24.689> than<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> receiver

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
aggressive to the past than the receiver

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
aggressive to the past than the receiver
is<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.400> case<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> tight

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is and in this case you know the tight

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
is and in this case you know the tight
end<00:01:27.390> doesn't<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.930> even<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> ability

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
end doesn't really even have the ability

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.850 
end doesn't really even have the ability
to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.729> his<00:01:29.970> body<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> block<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to use his body to kind of block the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
to use his body to kind of block the
linebacker<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.270> respect

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
linebacker because they just respect

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.679 
linebacker because they just respect
none<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.829> shift<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.610> through<00:01:35.970> him<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
none of that and shift me through him so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
none of that and shift me through him so
that<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> ball<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:37.920> once<00:01:38.130> I've

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that I can get to the ball now once I've

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
that I can get to the ball now once I've
caught<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.180> started<00:01:39.479> running<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.780> field

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

caught it and I started running up field
you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.320> noticed<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.829> Eli<00:01:41.159> Manning

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you know I noticed there's Eli Manning

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.850 
you know I noticed there's Eli Manning
kind<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> limping<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> to

it i'm gonna try to hurdle manning and
see<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.060> happens<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.869> where<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.140> really

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
see what happens this is where we really

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
see what happens this is where we really
talk<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.009> physics<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.670> game<00:01:50.909> just

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
talk about the physics in this game just

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.649 
talk about the physics in this game just
not<00:01:51.869> respecting<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.340> human<00:01:53.670> body<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
not respecting the human body not so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
not respecting the human body not so
much<00:01:54.780> tackling<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.799> i<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.070> expect<00:01:56.159> Eli

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
much tackling because i don't expect Eli

Manning to come down here and do a good

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.319 
Manning to come down here and do a good
form<00:01:58.920> tackle<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.460> look<00:01:59.759> at<00:01:59.880> what<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> game

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
form tackle but look at what the game

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
form tackle but look at what the game
does<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> mean<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.259> look<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.560> air

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
does I mean as I go look in the air

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.560 
does I mean as I go look in the air
first<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.610> Manning<00:02:02.969> isn't<00:02:03.090> even<00:02:03.420> looking

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
first of all Manning isn't even looking

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
first of all Manning isn't even looking
he<00:02:04.259> doesn't<00:02:04.590> even<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:05.009> seemingly<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.060> I'm

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
he doesn't even know seemingly that I'm

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.839 
he doesn't even know seemingly that I'm
here<00:02:06.659> he's<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.350> ran<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.160> field<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
here he's just ran down the field that

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.479 
here he's just ran down the field that
happens<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.720> caught<00:02:10.140> while<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.950> jumping

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
happens to get caught while I'm jumping

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.140 
happens to get caught while I'm jumping
in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> air

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
in the air

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.580 
in the air
and<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.599> he's<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.930> basically<00:02:13.349> get

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and then he's going to basically get

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.990 
and then he's going to basically get
totally<00:02:14.099> laid<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.579> now<00:02:15.420> take<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> look<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.730> 65<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
totally laid out now take a look at 65 I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.319 
totally laid out now take a look at 65 I
mean<00:02:18.379> why<00:02:19.379> does<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.829> happen<00:02:20.069> why<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.819> he<00:02:21.150> not

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
mean why does this happen why is he not

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.580 
mean why does this happen why is he not
trying<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.659> tackle<00:02:21.930> me<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.140> instead<00:02:22.470> I'm

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
trying to tackle me and instead I'm

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.589 
trying to tackle me and instead I'm
basically<00:02:22.920> breaking<00:02:23.370> his<00:02:23.640> neck<00:02:23.909> with<00:02:24.540> my

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
basically breaking his neck with my

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.360 
basically breaking his neck with my
forearm<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.319> mean<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.650> physics<00:02:26.189> based

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
forearm I mean this is physics based

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
forearm I mean this is physics based
gameplay<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.049> then<00:02:28.230> he's<00:02:28.379> going

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
gameplay here you know then he's going

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
gameplay here you know then he's going
to<00:02:28.560> come<00:02:28.799> over<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.099> he's<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.519> gonna<00:02:29.640> fall

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
to come over and he's just gonna fall

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.699 
to come over and he's just gonna fall
into<00:02:30.450> me<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.689> mean<00:02:30.900> basically<00:02:31.140> he's<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
into me I mean basically he's going to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.160 
into me I mean basically he's going to
block<00:02:31.980> me<00:02:32.340> from<00:02:32.609> hitting<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.329> ground<00:02:33.450> harder

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
block me from hitting the ground harder

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.929 
block me from hitting the ground harder
than<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.409> was<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.849> be

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
than I was and this is going to be

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.270 
than I was and this is going to be
considered<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.420> tackle<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.680> me<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:37.829> just<00:02:38.129> don't

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
considered a tackle to me I just don't

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.039 
considered a tackle to me I just don't
understand<00:02:38.760> any<00:02:38.909> of<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.390> mean<00:02:39.870> there's

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
understand any of that I mean there's

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.839 
understand any of that I mean there's
two<00:02:40.230> players<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> very<00:02:41.549> easy

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
two players here that have a very easy

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.940 
two players here that have a very easy
assignment<00:02:42.510> tackle<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> ball<00:02:43.439> carrier<00:02:43.799> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
assignment tackle the ball carrier and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
assignment tackle the ball carrier and
instead<00:02:44.670> look<00:02:45.269> at<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.540> actually<00:02:45.690> takes

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
instead look at what actually takes

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.160 
instead look at what actually takes
place<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.889> basically<00:02:47.670> kick<00:02:48.180> Eli<00:02:48.569> Manning<00:02:48.989> into

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
place I basically kick Eli Manning into

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.129 
place I basically kick Eli Manning into
the<00:02:49.260> ground<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.889> then<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.489> fall<00:02:50.690> over<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
the ground and then I fall over the

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.460 
the ground and then I fall over the
offensive<00:02:52.560> lineman<00:02:53.129> as<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.370> trip<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.239> down

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
offensive lineman as I trip and go down

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.319 
offensive lineman as I trip and go down
that's<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:56.040> representation<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:57.150> what
