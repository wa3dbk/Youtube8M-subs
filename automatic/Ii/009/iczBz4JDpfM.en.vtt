something on like this it's not going to
fall<00:04:16.180> off<00:04:16.239> that's<00:04:16.900> what<00:04:17.079> it's<00:04:17.199> not<00:04:17.320> good<00:04:17.530> but

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329

to<00:04:19.329> make<00:04:19.510> sure<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.780> doesn't<00:04:19.810> happen<00:04:20.139> make<00:04:20.680> is

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
to make sure that doesn't happen make is

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.629 
to make sure that doesn't happen make is
more<00:04:21.250> into<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.489> circle<00:04:22.060> they<00:04:23.020> did<00:04:23.500> now<00:04:24.130> glue<00:04:24.490> it

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
more into a circle they did now glue it

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.770 
more into a circle they did now glue it
on

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
on

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.210 
on
and<00:04:25.900> since<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.770> can't<00:04:26.800> find<00:04:27.160> my<00:04:27.220> glue<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:29.220> can't

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and since I can't find my glue I can't

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.760 
and since I can't find my glue I can't
show<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:30.880> just<00:04:31.210> um<00:04:32.340> ok<00:04:33.340> ok<00:04:33.670> this<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> clue

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.060 
just go like this in a big circle like
and<00:04:39.910> then<00:04:40.169> make<00:04:41.169> sure<00:04:41.200> it's<00:04:41.500> not<00:04:41.620> wet<00:04:41.800> glue

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
and then make sure it's not wet glue

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.620 
and then make sure it's not wet glue
because<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.490> just<00:04:42.669> drip<00:04:42.880> all<00:04:43.060> over<00:04:43.090> then<00:04:43.510> you

put it on sky like this for a little

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.360 
put it on sky like this for a little
while<00:04:46.750> then<00:04:47.620> let<00:04:47.770> go<00:04:48.010> put<00:04:48.790> something<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.270> it

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
while then let go put something on it
