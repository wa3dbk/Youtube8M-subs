00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 some kids here we are in a new 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 life this time between moon 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.240
 the only map where the shotguns if 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 work the two complete are rather 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 effective so that's what I'll be 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.850
 taking the class you see is the one that has 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.490
 been in this game with the tag 12 that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.980
 well I do not know very well yet if this one is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.400
 the best shotgun or is the other one of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.150
 tecpan cartridges faction hasp 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.980
 come on we say 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 but we're going to be with this one 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 to try the variety will be the map 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.329
 it trembles between our eyes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.859
 let's see I'm one of those who 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.880
 would be in this video here from the 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.770
 right 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.020
 etc etc too many enemies serious me 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.550
 would stay in this building because these and 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.590
 maximum and then next to the one on the right 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 I would also be navigating those 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.250
 buildings there 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.920
 with hilt and long barrel 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.130
 we are outside by the room of my fort 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.130
 we regulate regular 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.510
 today this building is allxi and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.940
 one with the other practically so what 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.940
 What I do is a woman for these two points 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.650
 the little package although it has fallen through here 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.570
 has tried damn dog no no dog 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.750
 ok for the inner friends he quoted them 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 for you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 for some reason people are not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 moving a lot 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.310
 the passage to colleagues 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.310
 this listening to another 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.930
 I do not know where the reason is but I'm 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.930
 listening to two 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.540
 for I have one below 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.540
 good good good 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.390
 but you or mus usufruct from behind took 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 from behind with children I think I have 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.620
 behind with fellow boys 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.520

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.900
 streak of 11 and good good good good 26 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.400
 streak points of 11 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.970
 each one has neither direct nor coña 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.040
 or better magician for shotguns 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.620
 my mother eye to the nervous data 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.050
 they will kill in brief 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.470
 negative I'm hearing cases day 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.530
 and I'm nervous edge 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.910

 Look, it's there 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.740

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.920
 I put nervous 14-2 did not wear 14 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.349
 low then 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.640
 I have half less than half of 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.170
 the one from which nothing happens what I know is 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.690
 that if I do not risk it has no fun 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.080
 for me or for you of roses not 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.850
 but uncle 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.430
 today we are gaining 44 16 eye to the data that 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.430
 we are seeing the beating the team 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.430

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.440
 good with team with a random team 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.010
 I'm going to put the end that will be 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.010
 changing not 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.269
 I'm listening to steps up 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.269
 fuck 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.209
 not me 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.320
 to see to see movement movement 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.320
 movement movement in movement 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.550
 the partner you have everything handled very 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.550
 handle and everything 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:39.840
 that is, when you listen to the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.220
 steps as you are able to know by 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.840
 where do people come from that I have a 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.790
 idea of ​​listening to the steps I have before 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560
 Over there 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.300
 I put him to listen to steps but I do not have 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.470
 idea of where the diego comes again 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.470
 seen are steps but that up 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.660
 the child is hidden 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.830
 what's up uncle 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.080
 also although this game of 80 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.930
 spy planes 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.810
 but spy planes for this is dead 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:19.300
 very well thank you for removing it before 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.250
 his rival escape I have not stopped 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.620
 Shotguns often have to film 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.289
 but they do it so well is 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.430
 far and to badly they do it but if it is 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.430
 normally close 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.120
 and where a man 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.080
 for the kids so you know if you 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.990
 touch this map the shotgun monkeys me 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.480
 I would recommend that the crisis because it is 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.810
 fun the truth 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.700
 listening to houses 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.520
 listening to steps 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.629
 to human work 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.629
 your young 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.259
 there are only two casualties left at the end 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.020
 no no no 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.429
 good mates offer a line 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.869
 quickie to show us the shotgun 

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:21.459
 It will be 12 because you have 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:24.580
 asked many what is the best 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:27.279
 shotgun a final low of the companion 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.439
 killing here the camper and west as well as 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.929
 for me for now the best shotgun is 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:35.050
 the other one that has five cartridges 

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:36.789
 nothing more because it has more cadence and 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.139
 It's very well, a few years ago, marques 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.039
 contribute distances and burn kids but 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.419
 who enjoys live 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.989
 greetings see you later 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.989
 next video
