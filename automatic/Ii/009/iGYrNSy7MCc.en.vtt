00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.729

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.930

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.019
 he practically takes her out of the street 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.000
 secretly does not tell you in a moment 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.300
 determined but by a single single one 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.340
 once at a time this double ina 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.169

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.229
 I already danced and I sang to see that 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.930

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.610
 and Serrano juguito that something emerges out there 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.430
 If the güito is what gives again 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.440
 that energy that joie de vivre that already 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.800
