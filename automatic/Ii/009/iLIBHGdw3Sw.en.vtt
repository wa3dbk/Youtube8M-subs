 Jennifer Raw Bad Student 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.540
 that is to say the act in this way the beginning 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.240
 about art programs 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.170
 ez day and that also they say to him hearing near the faculty and is that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.789
 the country 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.829
 hector students who study tata so they are different careers 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 and the same happens with plastic arts explain a little bit with which is the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 difference between star of course diana I tell you 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 the baton of before how much is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.170
 fundamentally with three academic departments and a center for 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200
 extension and artistic dissemination 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.289
 this academic department are department of theater department of 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.800
 visual arts and music department 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.100
 they are attached to the academic programs leading to the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 title of master noel music wen scenic arts of saying theater 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.519
 oo percent 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.419
 in plastic arts teacher in plastic arts 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.159
 who, in addition to the recent past, have also implemented programs of 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.049
 training 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.959
 percent dance 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.209
 and those same departments in account you take away the degrees 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.089
 and without censorship in both music education and education percent 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 data and of course in plastic arts 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.869
 the difference 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.939
 sensitive as it were between one program and another 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.349
 and is that the graduates in addition to the studies with 10% specific to the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.739
 discipline receive a pedagogical component transversally dispersed in 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.109
 the curriculum is two more semesters 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.510
 that last from degree to bachelor's degrees and this leads then to obtain the 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:55.579
 degree that makes them blind makes them better 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.949
 for him to perform as teachers of arts 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.389
 in the fundamental basic average 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.769
 can reach 80 3% this is one of the main differences I studied art 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.719
 equestrian 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.889
 the council mayor to be a teacher percent to be an artist expensive 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.689
 I'm out there at an international level of art 10 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.739
 that for one to be able to access more anticipated movies needs to do more things 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.209
 preparatory 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.479
 there was a little bit also trying to discover 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:30.549
 how much good because it is so necessary percent we will make these cuts before 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.229
 to enter the pri 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.789
 it's true the visual arts department is perhaps the only 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.219
 department faculty 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.039
 e for it what vázquez crisis that the students that aspire those of artists 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.139
 plastics for example do not need percent 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.309
 of a specific test was increased until the general test was completed 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.439
 in the university and with this scene the studies however in theater and music 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.339
 percent for quite some time now 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.339
 that they have implemented their study dominated preparatory 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.689
 and the address for example in the case of local music we have cases of 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.759
 students who enter from 9 years 10 years 11 years old already has 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.499
 we quite a long time this of being proper of the discipline is a 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:14.879
 Need to 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.739
 the position that for example to be a pianist they need to weigh from very 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.569
 early age the tennis player of 18 years after he started at 18 19 20 years 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.480
 I think that a virtuoso in the instrument can hardly become a 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.479
 then because it is necessary that the preparatory studies 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.240
 reads are constituted in admission test one of this 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.040
 terminal that journey for those who for all they agree to the studies 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.759
 superior to university studies in the case of theater of the courts a 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.210
 shorter journey and the flies in a first meeting of a week 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.999
 Later you want to make a selection 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.430
 then those that are selected are one gets in a semester 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:53.689
 preparatory 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.309
 at the end everything that this will be the end of this semester questions 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.389
 approve all subjects access to higher education 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:05.599
 donaire acan-efe try to hide it from the times of the preparatory course for 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.020
 in theater and cinema is that there is no less a semester 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.410
 i for those of three loans for mexico for example how long 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.849
 you need some character 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.509
 of music depends a lot on the moment between debt after the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.740
 student in 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.710
 per hundred but basically they are this proximity between the 4 6 semesters 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.259
 before entering higher education to the clubs that have already 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.460
 recognized moss 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.379
 as a university student 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.050
 properly said good life here there are many thanks for being with us from 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.339
 team answering requests 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.929
 poured all thank you very much on the contrary it is very important that we have 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.129
 the possibility of this space in which we can clarify 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.199
 doubts for the viewers and all the aspirants 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.199
 to studies in our faculty 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.889
 all this s in therefore take into account for example the mail of the vice-dean 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.950
 The former vice decanatura farro the parties soon could point ccoo point 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.770
 and the phones 2 19 58 82 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.240
 others 19 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.669
 88 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.169
 83 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.219
 ais we will be attentive to any attempt is worth it as well 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.089
 this opportunity to invite them to participate in the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.889

 relevant 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.789
 it is very important for the faculty 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.889

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.229
 external members of this small community join us 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.569
 in the development of this important event the required court to edgar 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.760
 They experience in Iran angels 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.160
