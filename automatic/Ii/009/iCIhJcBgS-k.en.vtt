ok so there's our G minor 7 a lot of

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.090 
ok so there's our G minor 7 a lot of
zeros<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.630> 3ds<00:01:50.079> there<00:01:50.259> let's<00:01:50.740> take<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.920> look<00:01:51.039> at

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
zeros and 3ds there let's take a look at

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.810 
zeros and 3ds there let's take a look at
the<00:01:51.219> right<00:01:51.369> hand

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
