00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
grand said we were happy to know that

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.450 
grand said we were happy to know that
the<00:06:23.789> Huawei<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:24.210> x5<00:06:24.960> has<00:06:25.200> 720p<00:06:26.100> video

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
the Huawei is x5 has 720p video

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.460 
the Huawei is x5 has 720p video
recording<00:06:27.260> unfortunately<00:06:28.260> it<00:06:28.320> doesn't

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
recording unfortunately it doesn't

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.590 
recording unfortunately it doesn't
translate<00:06:28.950> to<00:06:29.190> a<00:06:29.220> great<00:06:29.760> overall<00:06:30.240> quality

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
translate to a great overall quality

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.350 
translate to a great overall quality
first<00:06:31.470> of<00:06:31.650> all<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:32.010> shoots<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.460> rate<00:06:32.700> of<00:06:32.910> 16

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
first of all it shoots that rate of 16

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.940 
first of all it shoots that rate of 16
frames<00:06:33.600> per<00:06:33.870> second<00:06:34.260> so<00:06:34.289> it<00:06:34.500> looks<00:06:34.650> extremely

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
frames per second so it looks extremely

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.190 
frames per second so it looks extremely
choppy<00:06:35.610> on<00:06:35.970> top<00:06:36.479> of<00:06:36.599> that<00:06:36.659> it<00:06:36.750> doesn't<00:06:36.900> take

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
choppy on top of that it doesn't take

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.040 
choppy on top of that it doesn't take
that<00:06:37.620> much

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
that much

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.899 
that much
detail<00:06:38.470> it<00:06:38.710> seems<00:06:38.979> like<00:06:39.099> it's<00:06:39.250> always<00:06:39.460> kind<00:06:39.849> of

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
detail it seems like it's always kind of

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:41.850 
detail it seems like it's always kind of
fuzzy<00:06:40.300> looking<00:06:40.539> and<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:41.229> as<00:06:41.379> sharp<00:06:41.620> as<00:06:41.740> we

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
fuzzy looking and not as sharp as we

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.379 
fuzzy looking and not as sharp as we
were<00:06:41.949> like<00:06:42.159> it<00:06:42.340> to<00:06:42.490> so<00:06:42.729> you're<00:06:42.940> not<00:06:43.000> gonna<00:06:43.150> get

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
were like it to so you're not gonna get

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.529 
were like it to so you're not gonna get
the<00:06:43.509> best<00:06:43.690> best<00:06:44.349> looking<00:06:44.650> videos<00:06:44.979> out<00:06:45.190> of<00:06:45.340> this

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
the best best looking videos out of this

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.020 
the best best looking videos out of this
with<00:06:46.539> the<00:06:46.720> prototype<00:06:47.259> unit<00:06:47.650> :<00:06:48.159> quality<00:06:48.490> so<00:06:48.699> far

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
with the prototype unit : quality so far

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.149 
with the prototype unit : quality so far
seems<00:06:49.330> pretty<00:06:49.539> pretty<00:06:49.990> decent<00:06:50.560> except<00:06:51.039> for

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
seems pretty pretty decent except for

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.339 
seems pretty pretty decent except for
the<00:06:51.220> fact<00:06:51.430> that<00:06:51.550> the<00:06:51.819> earpiece<00:06:52.449> itself<00:06:52.900> it's

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:53.349 
the fact that the earpiece itself it's

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:54.930 
the fact that the earpiece itself it's
kind<00:06:53.530> of<00:06:53.590> lacking<00:06:53.979> in<00:06:54.099> volume<00:06:54.550> but<00:06:54.729> for<00:06:54.879> the

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
kind of lacking in volume but for the

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.969 
kind of lacking in volume but for the
most<00:06:55.090> part<00:06:55.240> callers<00:06:55.870> called<00:06:56.319> conversations

most part callers called conversations

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.730 
most part callers called conversations
were<00:06:57.099> clear<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:57.639> noise<00:06:58.300> free<00:06:58.840> as<00:06:59.259> far<00:06:59.620> as

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
were clear and noise free as far as

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.439 
were clear and noise free as far as
battery<00:06:59.979> life<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.490> unit<00:07:00.729> that<00:07:00.849> we<00:07:00.909> have<00:07:01.000> here

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
battery life the unit that we have here

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.830 
battery life the unit that we have here
is<00:07:01.659> only<00:07:01.949> supports<00:07:02.949> edge<00:07:03.159> here<00:07:04.120> in<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.240> US<00:07:04.569> so

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
is only supports edge here in the US so

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.180 
is only supports edge here in the US so
we<00:07:04.870> can't<00:07:05.169> say<00:07:05.319> for<00:07:05.349> sure<00:07:05.560> how<00:07:06.009> it's<00:07:06.129> gonna

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
we can't say for sure how it's gonna

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.249 
we can't say for sure how it's gonna
work<00:07:06.340> with<00:07:06.819> one<00:07:07.300> of<00:07:07.330> the<00:07:07.419> carriers<00:07:07.810> if<00:07:08.050> when

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
work with one of the carriers if when

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.290 
work with one of the carriers if when
the<00:07:08.349> carrier's<00:07:08.650> do<00:07:08.979> end<00:07:09.250> up<00:07:09.400> getting<00:07:10.090> the

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
the carrier's do end up getting the

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.749 
the carrier's do end up getting the
device<00:07:10.659> but<00:07:11.259> from<00:07:11.530> what<00:07:11.650> we<00:07:11.770> experienced<00:07:12.340> with

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 
device but from what we experienced with

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.520

edge<00:07:12.909> connections<00:07:13.449> battery<00:07:14.020> life<00:07:14.169> is<00:07:14.319> pretty

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
edge connections battery life is pretty

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.709 
edge connections battery life is pretty
good<00:07:14.940> ultimately<00:07:15.940> there's<00:07:16.180> gonna<00:07:16.270> be<00:07:16.419> a<00:07:16.449> lot

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
good ultimately there's gonna be a lot

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.730 
not as popular here in the US we know
