65 through 90 and the lowercase letters
start<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.029> again<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.420> 97<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
start up again at 97 and we're going to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.910 
start up again at 97 and we're going to
look<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.850> how<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.600> numbers<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
look at how these numbers which are in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.570 
look at how these numbers which are in
base<00:00:23.490> ten<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.750> converted<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.380> binary<00:00:25.650> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
base ten can be converted to binary this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580 
base ten can be converted to binary this
is<00:00:26.760> useful<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.240> many<00:00:27.869> computers<00:00:28.380> use

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
is useful because many computers use

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
is useful because many computers use
binary<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.099> purpose<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.910> these

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
binary and the purpose of these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
binary and the purpose of these
numerical<00:00:33.989> codes<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.610> by

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
numerical codes is for the use by

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.479 
numerical codes is for the use by
computers<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> let's<00:00:37.920> talk<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
computers so let's talk about how to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
computers so let's talk about how to
convert<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.120> number<00:00:39.390> 65<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.379> represents

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
convert the number 65 which represents

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
convert the number 65 which represents
the<00:00:41.399> letter<00:00:41.610> A<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.149> ASCII<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:43.559> binary<00:00:44.780> so

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the letter A and ASCII into binary so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
the letter A and ASCII into binary so
whenever<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.440> want<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.710> come<00:00:46.860> five<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> base

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
whenever you want to come five to base

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
whenever you want to come five to base
two<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.480> any<00:00:48.750> decimal<00:00:49.559> number<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
two or really any decimal number to a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
two or really any decimal number to a
binary<00:00:50.700> number<00:00:50.969> we're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> divide<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
binary number we're going to divide it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
binary number we're going to divide it
repeatedly<00:00:53.070> by<00:00:53.340> two<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> take

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
repeatedly by two so we're going to take

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.459 
repeatedly by two so we're going to take
65<00:00:56.250> divided<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> 32<00:00:57.989> remainder

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
65 divided by two and get 32 remainder

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.540 
65 divided by two and get 32 remainder
one<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> then<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> repeat<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
one and then we're going to repeat that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
one and then we're going to repeat that
process<00:00:59.760> over<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:01.140> making<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
process over and over again making a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
process over and over again making a
note<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> remainder<00:01:02.910> until<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.449> down

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
note of the remainder until we get down

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
note of the remainder until we get down
to<00:01:03.960> 0<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.189> remainder

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to 0 with some remainder

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.000 
to 0 with some remainder
now<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.110> dividing<00:01:07.320> by<00:01:07.500> two<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
now when you're dividing by two the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
now when you're dividing by two the
remainder<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.400> always<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.880> 0<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.450> 1

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
remainder is always going to be 0 or 1

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
remainder is always going to be 0 or 1
and<00:01:09.990> those<00:01:10.619> remainders<00:01:11.189> represent<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and those remainders represent the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.560 
and those remainders represent the
digits<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.540> our<00:01:12.659> binary<00:01:12.960> version<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> 65<00:01:14.760> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
digits in our binary version of 65 so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
digits in our binary version of 65 so
notice<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.259> down<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> 2<00:01:16.890> divided<00:01:17.250> by<00:01:17.369> 2

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
notice we get down to 2 divided by 2

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.830 
notice we get down to 2 divided by 2
equals<00:01:17.880> 1<00:01:18.479> remainder<00:01:19.200> 0<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:23.840> go

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
equals 1 remainder 0 and we have to go

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
equals 1 remainder 0 and we have to go
one<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.140> step<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.770> always<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> go<00:01:26.250> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
one more step we always have to go one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
one more step we always have to go one
more<00:01:26.430> step<00:01:26.840> beyond<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.320> number<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
more step beyond the number that is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
more step beyond the number that is
actually<00:01:29.610> smaller<00:01:30.030> than<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.659> divisor<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
actually smaller than the divisor so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.450 
actually smaller than the divisor so
we're<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> say<00:01:32.009> 1<00:01:32.280> divided<00:01:32.909> by<00:01:32.939> 2<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.689> 0

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
we're going to say 1 divided by 2 is 0

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.350 
we're going to say 1 divided by 2 is 0
because<00:01:35.460> 2<00:01:35.939> can't<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.329> into<00:01:36.509> 1<00:01:36.780> remainder<00:01:37.650> 1<00:01:38.360> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
because 2 can't go into 1 remainder 1 so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
because 2 can't go into 1 remainder 1 so
now<00:01:39.689> looking<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:41.240> these<00:01:42.240> remainders<00:01:43.430> from

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
now looking at these remainders from

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.100 
now looking at these remainders from
bottom<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> top<00:01:45.950> we're<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.340> our

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
bottom to top we're going to have our

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
bottom to top we're going to have our
new<00:01:49.110> version<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> number<00:01:50.220> 65<00:01:50.640> 1<00:01:51.060> 0<00:01:51.570> 0<00:01:52.140> 0<00:01:52.970> 5

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
new version of the number 65 1 0 0 0 5

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.620 
new version of the number 65 1 0 0 0 5
zeros<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.790> looks<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> number

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
zeros and a one it looks like the number

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.139 
zeros and a one it looks like the number
1<00:01:57.810> million<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.290> 1<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.619> remember<00:01:59.189> each<00:01:59.729> place

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
1 million in 1 but remember each place

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
1 million in 1 but remember each place
value<00:02:00.299> has<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.439> meaning<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.920> binary

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
value has a different meaning in binary

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.319 
value has a different meaning in binary
than<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.850> does<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.329> base<00:02:03.570> 10<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> counting<00:02:06.030> on

greater than that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.190 
greater than that
now<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.330> never<00:02:19.540> looks<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
now this never looks like a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
now this never looks like a
million-in-one<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.340> actually<00:02:22.240> it's<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:23.110> at

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
million-in-one but actually it's not at

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.850 
million-in-one but actually it's not at
65<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.180> next<00:02:25.390> number<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.990> not<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.350> million

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
65 so the next number is not a million

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.949 
65 so the next number is not a million
in<00:02:26.980> two<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.520> fact<00:02:27.730> there's<00:02:27.940> no<00:02:28.120> two<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
in two in fact there's no two in the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.750 
in two in fact there's no two in the
binary<00:02:29.170> system<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:29.860> only<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.220> zeros<00:02:30.580> and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
binary system we only have zeros and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.630 
binary system we only have zeros and
ones<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:31.989> increase<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:33.069> last<00:02:33.370> digit

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
ones so if we increase that last digit

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.300 
ones so if we increase that last digit
one<00:02:34.030> two<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.450> -<00:02:34.750> instead<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.860> carry

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
one two it - instead we have to carry

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.809 
one two it - instead we have to carry
the<00:02:36.520> 1<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:38.050> we're<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.430> next

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
the 1 so we're going to have the next

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:47.670 
the 1 so we're going to have the next
number<00:02:40.150> will<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:41.010> 1<00:02:42.010> 0<00:02:42.310> 0<00:02:42.760> 0<00:02:43.530> 0<00:02:45.000> 1<00:02:46.000> 0<00:02:46.680> right

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
number will be 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 right

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.650 
number will be 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 right
because<00:02:47.920> when<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.550> just<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:49.060> base<00:02:49.300> 10

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
because when it's just like in base 10

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.080 
because when it's just like in base 10
when<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.989> get<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> number<00:02:50.500> 9<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
when you get to the number 9 you have to

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.380 
when you get to the number 9 you have to
move<00:02:52.330> up<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.080> next<00:02:53.320> digit<00:02:53.560> 2<00:02:53.980> 1<00:02:54.459> 0<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
move up to the next digit 2 1 0 to the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.350 
move up to the next digit 2 1 0 to the
number<00:02:55.660> 10<00:02:55.930> when<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.590> get<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.950> number<00:02:57.360> 99

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
number 10 when you get to the number 99

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.800 
number 10 when you get to the number 99
you<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.080> move<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.739> 100<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.209> since<00:03:01.480> 1<00:03:01.780> is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you have to move up to 100 so since 1 is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.059 
you have to move up to 100 so since 1 is
the<00:03:02.080> greatest<00:03:02.590> value<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.790> digit<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.450> binary

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
the greatest value of a digit in binary

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.290 
the greatest value of a digit in binary
we<00:03:06.069> can't<00:03:06.250> go<00:03:06.340> any<00:03:06.489> bigger<00:03:06.610> than<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.000> we

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
we can't go any bigger than that so we

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.600 
we can't go any bigger than that so we
move<00:03:07.480> up<00:03:07.600> 1<00:03:07.840> place<00:03:08.140> value<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.220> what<00:03:09.459> do<00:03:09.519> you

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
move up 1 place value so what do you

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.979 
move up 1 place value so what do you
think<00:03:09.790> 67<00:03:10.540> would<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.870> or<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.380> more<00:03:11.739> than<00:03:12.250> 1<00:03:13.120> 0<00:03:13.569> 0

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
think 67 would be or one more than 1 0 0

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.539 
think 67 would be or one more than 1 0 0
0<00:03:14.440> 0<00:03:14.560> 1<00:03:15.010> 0

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
0 0 1 0

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.870 
0 0 1 0
well<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.660> our<00:03:17.019> ones<00:03:17.799> digit<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.610> be

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
well that one our ones digit can be

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270 
well that one our ones digit can be
increased<00:03:19.420> because<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.350> can<00:03:20.500> move<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.799> up<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.920> 1

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
increased because we can move it up to 1

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.520 
increased because we can move it up to 1
so<00:03:21.459> we're<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.820> 1<00:03:22.030> 0<00:03:22.299> 0<00:03:23.049> 0<00:03:23.370> 0<00:03:24.370> 1<00:03:24.850> 1<00:03:25.530> now

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
so we're going to have 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 now

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.500 
so we're going to have 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 now
counting<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.310> from<00:03:27.549> there<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.239> are<00:03:28.299> we<00:03:28.390> going

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
counting up from there what are we going

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.100 
counting up from there what are we going
to<00:03:28.570> do<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.320> we<00:03:29.500> need<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.890> increase<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.810> ones

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
to do but we need to increase the ones

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.180 
to do but we need to increase the ones
digit<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.860> can't<00:03:33.130> go<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.610> 2<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
digit we can't go up to a 2 then that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.190 
digit we can't go up to a 2 then that
would<00:03:36.340> mean<00:03:36.459> we'd<00:03:36.670> carry<00:03:36.970> over<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.690> next

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
would mean we'd carry over to the next

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.140 
would mean we'd carry over to the next
digit<00:03:38.560> but<00:03:38.859> we<00:03:38.950> can't<00:03:39.160> go<00:03:39.280> up<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.579> 2<00:03:39.790> there<00:03:39.970> so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
digit but we can't go up to a 2 there so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.640 
digit but we can't go up to a 2 there so
we<00:03:40.239> have<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.390> go<00:03:40.570> up<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> next<00:03:41.170> digit<00:03:41.440> so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
we have to go up to the next digit so

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.530 
we have to go up to the next digit so
this<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.920> just<00:03:42.130> like<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.519> base<00:03:42.730> 10<00:03:43.120> when<00:03:43.420> we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
this is just like in base 10 when we

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
this is just like in base 10 when we
have<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.780> 99<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:44.859> have<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.220> go<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.820> 100

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
have a 99 and we have to go up to 100

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.190 
have a 99 and we have to go up to 100
except<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.829> 1<00:03:48.040> 1<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.730> then<00:03:48.910> 100<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.840> binary

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
except it's a 1 1 and then 100 in binary

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.960 
except it's a 1 1 and then 100 in binary
and<00:03:53.200> one<00:03:53.440> nice<00:03:53.650> thing<00:03:53.680> about<00:03:53.920> binary<00:03:54.640> well

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and one nice thing about binary well

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.490 
and one nice thing about binary well
it's<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.600> base<00:03:55.870> 10<00:03:56.140> it's<00:03:56.320> very

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
it's just like base 10 it's very

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.050 
it's just like base 10 it's very
repetitive<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:58.350> from<00:03:59.350> 100<00:03:59.890> if<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.459> look<00:04:00.700> back

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
repetitive so from 100 if we look back

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.110 
repetitive so from 100 if we look back
to<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.630> top<00:04:02.049> we're<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.220> have<00:04:03.310> 101<00:04:04.019> 101<00:04:05.040> 0

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
to the top we're going to have 101 101 0

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.240 
to the top we're going to have 101 101 0
100<00:04:07.120> 1<00:04:07.510> 1<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.750> shouldn't<00:04:08.109> say<00:04:08.260> 100<00:04:08.680> technically

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
100 1 1 I shouldn't say 100 technically

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.870 
100 1 1 I shouldn't say 100 technically
because<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.959> doesn't<00:04:11.290> represent<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.680> hundred

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
because this doesn't represent a hundred

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.620 
because this doesn't represent a hundred
but<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.660> any<00:04:13.840> case<00:04:13.930> we<00:04:14.740> have<00:04:14.770> 1<00:04:15.580> 0-0<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:16.420> going

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
but in any case we have 1 0-0 is going

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.890 
but in any case we have 1 0-0 is going
to<00:04:16.690> be<00:04:16.840> followed<00:04:17.320> by<00:04:17.350> 1<00:04:18.220> 0<00:04:19.200> 1<00:04:21.270> right<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.750> last

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
to be followed by 1 0 1 right the last

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.270 
to be followed by 1 0 1 right the last
two<00:04:23.170> digits<00:04:23.500> are<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.770> repeat<00:04:24.070> like

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
two digits are going to repeat like

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.520 
two digits are going to repeat like
waited<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.760> first<00:04:25.030> 3<00:04:25.810> numbers<00:04:26.140> we<00:04:26.260> put<00:04:26.290> up

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
waited in the first 3 numbers we put up

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.440 
waited in the first 3 numbers we put up
there<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.890> then<00:04:27.370> we're<00:04:27.580> going<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.760> have<00:04:27.970> and

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
there and then we're going to have and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.620 
there and then we're going to have and
after<00:04:29.200> 1<00:04:29.470> 0<00:04:29.800> 1<00:04:30.070> we're<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.670> 1<00:04:31.000> 1<00:04:31.210> 0

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
after 1 0 1 we're going to have 1 1 0

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.980 
after 1 0 1 we're going to have 1 1 0
and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:33.190> what<00:04:33.370> did<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.610> have<00:04:33.790> after<00:04:34.210> 1<00:04:34.390> 0<00:04:34.750> 4

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
and then what did we have after 1 0 4

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.270 
and then what did we have after 1 0 4
the<00:04:35.080> last<00:04:35.290> two<00:04:35.440> digits<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:35.860> had<00:04:35.950> 1<00:04:36.160> 1<00:04:36.430> 1<00:04:37.300> 0<00:04:37.870> 0<00:04:37.990> 0<00:04:38.470> 1

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
the last two digits we had 1 1 1 0 0 0 1

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.830 
the last two digits we had 1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1<00:04:39.520> 1<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:41.170> on<00:04:41.430> 497<00:04:42.430> actually<00:04:43.300> if<00:04:43.390> you<00:04:43.480> divide

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
1 1 and so on 497 actually if you divide

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.680 
1 1 and so on 497 actually if you divide
it<00:04:43.990> by<00:04:44.020> 2<00:04:44.230> as<00:04:44.800> we<00:04:44.980> discussed<00:04:45.400> before

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
it by 2 as we discussed before

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.640 
it by 2 as we discussed before
successive<00:04:46.690> times<00:04:46.960> you're<00:04:47.230> going<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.380> end<00:04:47.560> up

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
successive times you're going to end up

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.990 
successive times you're going to end up
with<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.950> remainders<00:04:48.460> 1<00:04:48.880> 1<00:04:49.860> 0<00:04:50.860> 0<00:04:51.190> 0<00:04:51.910> 0<00:04:52.860> 1<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.910> you

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
with the remainders 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 so you

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.330 
with the remainders 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 so you
can<00:04:55.120> kind<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.390> see<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.600> similarity<00:04:56.230> between

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
can kind of see the similarity between

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.910 
can kind of see the similarity between
65<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.370> 97<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:59.020> see<00:04:59.230> why<00:04:59.380> both<00:04:59.590> of<00:04:59.620> them

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
65 and 97 you can see why both of them

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.550 
65 and 97 you can see why both of them
were<00:05:00.070> chosen<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:01.330> we're<00:05:01.600> starting<00:05:01.780> again<00:05:02.020> at<00:05:02.320> 1

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
were chosen so we're starting again at 1

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.230 
were chosen so we're starting again at 1
you<00:05:02.890> can<00:05:03.040> kind<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.430> keep<00:05:03.610> carrying<00:05:04.060> that

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
you can kind of just keep carrying that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.300 
you can kind of just keep carrying that
one<00:05:04.540> one<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.960> beginning<00:05:05.080> down<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.190> we're

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
one one at the beginning down so we're

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.190 
one one at the beginning down so we're
going<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.460> have<00:05:06.670> 1<00:05:07.060> 1<00:05:07.540> 0<00:05:08.170> 0<00:05:08.470> 0<00:05:09.010> 1<00:05:09.760> 0<00:05:10.030> for<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> next

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
going to have 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 for the next

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.670 
going to have 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 for the next
value<00:05:11.790> increasing<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:12.970> 1<00:05:13.210> 0<00:05:13.570> by<00:05:13.840> 1<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.290> have<00:05:14.440> 1

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
value increasing that 1 0 by 1 we have 1

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.730 
value increasing that 1 0 by 1 we have 1
1<00:05:15.070> 0<00:05:15.640> 0<00:05:15.760> 0<00:05:16.300> 1<00:05:17.050> 1<00:05:18.120> increasing<00:05:19.120> 1<00:05:19.390> 1<00:05:19.720> after<00:05:20.440> 1<00:05:20.560> 1

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
1 0 0 0 1 1 increasing 1 1 after 1 1

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.120 
1 0 0 0 1 1 increasing 1 1 after 1 1
what<00:05:20.950> came<00:05:21.130> next<00:05:21.340> 100<00:05:22.470> not<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.860> hundred

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
what came next 100 not really a hundred

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.160 
what came next 100 not really a hundred
1<00:05:24.790> 0<00:05:25.150> 0<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.200> that's<00:05:26.440> going<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.770> be<00:05:26.920> 1<00:05:27.220> 1<00:05:27.580> 0<00:05:28.180> 0<00:05:28.300> 1<00:05:28.810> 0

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
1 0 0 so that's going to be 1 1 0 0 1 0

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.910 
1 0 0 so that's going to be 1 1 0 0 1 0
0<00:05:30.510> ok<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.690> then<00:05:31.810> those<00:05:31.990> those<00:05:32.410> first<00:05:32.680> two

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
0 ok and then those those first two

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.100 
0 ok and then those those first two
digits<00:05:33.130> there<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:34.300> two<00:05:34.540> furthest<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.080> the

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
digits there the two furthest to the

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.050 
digits there the two furthest to the
right<00:05:35.230> are<00:05:35.500> going<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.740> repeat<00:05:36.100> like<00:05:36.340> following

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
right are going to repeat like following

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.320 
right are going to repeat like following
the<00:05:37.180> pattern<00:05:37.480> from<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.870> FIR<00:05:38.080> from<00:05:38.350> 97<00:05:38.800> 98<00:05:39.190> 99

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
the pattern from the FIR from 97 98 99

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.490 
the pattern from the FIR from 97 98 99
so<00:05:40.330> we're<00:05:40.420> going<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.570> have<00:05:40.720> 1<00:05:41.020> 1<00:05:41.320> 0<00:05:41.800> 0<00:05:42.280> 1<00:05:42.670> 0<00:05:42.730> 1<00:05:43.480> 1<00:05:43.840> 1

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
so we're going to have 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.350 
so we're going to have 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1
0<00:05:45.340> 0<00:05:45.460> 1<00:05:46.090> 1<00:05:46.540> 0<00:05:47.260> and<00:05:47.590> 1<00:05:48.460> 1<00:05:48.880> 0<00:05:49.450> 0<00:05:49.960> 1<00:05:50.350> 1<00:05:50.920> 1<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.940> then

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
0 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 and then

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.600 
0 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 and then
that<00:05:52.630> pattern<00:05:53.020> would<00:05:53.230> continue<00:05:53.830> what<00:05:54.370> would

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
that pattern would continue what would

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.990 
that pattern would continue what would
the<00:05:54.760> next<00:05:55.290> value<00:05:56.290> in<00:05:56.560> each<00:05:56.920> of<00:05:57.160> these<00:05:57.310> columns

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
the next value in each of these columns

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.860 
the next value in each of these columns
be<00:05:58.360> if<00:05:58.570> you<00:05:58.720> think<00:05:58.750> about<00:05:59.200> it<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.160> 1<00:06:00.520> 1<00:06:00.670> 1<00:06:00.940> is<00:06:01.420> the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
be if you think about it so 1 1 1 is the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.020 
be if you think about it so 1 1 1 is the
biggest<00:06:02.470> three-digit<00:06:02.980> number<00:06:03.250> in<00:06:03.280> binary<00:06:03.610> so

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
biggest three-digit number in binary so

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.320 
biggest three-digit number in binary so
the<00:06:06.930> letter<00:06:07.170> capital<00:06:07.650> H<00:06:08.070> would<00:06:08.490> be<00:06:08.520> 1<00:06:08.940> 0<00:06:09.450> 0<00:06:10.580> 1<00:06:11.580> 0

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
the letter capital H would be 1 0 0 1 0

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.640 
the letter capital H would be 1 0 0 1 0
0<00:06:12.450> 0<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:13.820> the<00:06:14.820> letter<00:06:15.030> little<00:06:15.570> H<00:06:15.780> lowercase<00:06:16.410> H

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
0 0 and the letter little H lowercase H

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.070 
0 0 and the letter little H lowercase H
1<00:06:17.040> 1<00:06:17.340> 0<00:06:17.910> 1<00:06:18.240> 0<00:06:18.540> 0<00:06:19.380> 0<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.970> you<00:06:21.300> just<00:06:21.510> continue<00:06:21.840> in

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
1 1 0 1 0 0 0 and you just continue in

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.440 
1 1 0 1 0 0 0 and you just continue in
that<00:06:22.110> way
