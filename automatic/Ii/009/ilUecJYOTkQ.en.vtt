00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 johnny dork one does not exaggerate 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.440
 made-up and diagonally that can go well 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.090
 the way to creating a super 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.889
 intelligent to us is that we need 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 the most basic secrets of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.099
 decrypt the universe 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 hello we together the film factory now 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.100
 fans are already in the cinemas I have 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.320
 he has already looked at it for you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.119
 and it is the story of orchester 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 He is the greatest expert on the market 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 area of ​​artificial intelligence and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 Together with his wife evelyn are 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.740
 they are really incredible 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.009
 However, progress is needed 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 one extremists group very 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.579
 she is technically hostile 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.969
 make a stop he will die 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.410
 and then he expects his 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.540
 memory and his brain with one 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.700
 gigantic machine namely with a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 Supercomputer is connected so that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840
 his intelligence goes through the whole 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 Internet can spread 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 how the whole looks like you can see here 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.120
 in the trader 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.150
 Please welcome my partner 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.050
 scientific research and im 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.610
 private life dr orchestra the way to 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.900
 creating a super intelligent too 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.400
 is that we need the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.210
 most basic secrets of the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.210
 decrypt the universe 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.080
 imagine a machine with the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.750
 complete bandwidth human 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 emotions 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.070
 her analytical power would be greater 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 as the bundled intelligence of all 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.740
 people since the beginning of time some 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.650
 Scientists call this as 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 singularity the professor 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.020
 I call it transcendence behind the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.330
 There is a radical attack on the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 technology group with names right you 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.570
 The whole country had our labs 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.570
 attacked our research results 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 1 radioactive poison is lost 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560
 the bullet must have been used with it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 were the damage is irreparable 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.190
 jurist body dies but his mind is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.500
 a pattern of electrical signals 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.220
 we can upload his awareness 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 we can not wake up like this 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 suppose that works if we do something 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.070
 forgot a thought one 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.910
 Childhood memory from where do we know 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910
 Who do we have to do it 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.959
 I can not feel anything 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 I'm here brings me online i 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.620
 need more energy it likes smart 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.090
 even sentience is that 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.740
 not where it shuts off I want to know 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
 what stand it is he 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.660
 her friend has a limit 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.820
 she does not know the danger 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.290
 That's incredible 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.660
 we fight it as they can 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.970
 not an artificial intelligence 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.010
 Like any intelligence she has needs 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.200
 right all died 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.290
 this artificial intelligence will become 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.880
 evolve where is the machine 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.880
 that influences 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 probably the whole field 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.460
 I think the idea behind the film 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.890
 incredibly strong because just when you are 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.810
 through the internet will be and after 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.510
 singularity after technical 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.370
 Singularity Google does not know that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.990
 only google actually actually on so 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.930
 something similar researches but also the 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.910
 drive behind it all 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.080
 film is now especially tangible for me 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.390
 but I'm actually there with me 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.970
 has dealt with in general 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.850
 also the construction of the film certainly 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.940
 makes sense first of all the figures in the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.290
 introduce and then the development 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.790
 So the thought behind it 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.260
 the fits in any case, the 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.270
 visual implementation is definitely 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.060
 breathtaking one must not forget 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.310
 that the director of the cameraman of 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.120
 christopher nolan is and you can see that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.370
 all over 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.520
 even if he does not cameraman himself 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.290
 then in the sense was director 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.670
 photography but he has directed 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
 but that's why he can still be 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 both I want my value now 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.220
 You can see that when you see it too 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.200
 sees that them the pictures and 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.580
 are more important than the story and that is 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.190
 namely then the biggest drawback of the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.260
 films invents the pictures hornier than me 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.970
 to think about it okay how do i bring 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.850
 this film finally, after all 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.740
 on the spot and that's actually it 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.720
 what in the first second then already 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.549
 wrong goes right in the first 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.130
 two minutes experience like the movie 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.020
 go out and then do this five years 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.340
 before that takes the film completely the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.830
 tension and is one for me 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.900
 moronic calls the a filmmaker 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.670
 have done for a long time and that is 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.260
 a real bitter that he is the end of the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.510
 But that's not the beginning 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.870
 biggest problem of the film but there is 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.580
 several narrative scripts that exactly 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.230
 relatively clumsy in this way 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.330
 be done so that it will be something 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.010
 assuming black aperture two years 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.140
 later and it will not work at all 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.240
 questions what happened there is that 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.760
 at all possible how does it all happen 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.380
 will be very scientific in the beginning 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.370
 explained so i know okay thats 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.770
 now the state of things 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.270
 but any further development will be 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.530
 no longer explained but you have to 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.690
 Just take it like that 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.570
 honestly that takes a lot 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.680
 fascination that this computer is global 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.930
 should act 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.520
 and is a global problem 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.710
 not even aware of the spectator 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.760
 even if you are visually not global 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.470
 is but a 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.270
 So this is my desert town I 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.520
 do not see what is now sm in london beijing 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.650
 he intervenes that is a pity too 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.150
 because that would me that threat too 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.530
 somehow make you aware that makes you 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.430
 Film not have to be in the head 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.170
 introduce yourself 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.030
 but I do not need a movie and 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.440
 actor whether that is johnny depp 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.660
 is rebecca horn morgan freeman paul 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.910
 bettany you all really like to stay but 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.910
 completely colorless and soulless as only 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.350
 so small decals of one 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.660
 badly written figures that is 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.310
 pity brings but nothing is the film 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.350
 on the whole very, very very very 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.030
 weak though visually convincing 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.830
 I want you to know scared of you 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.810
 you he this idea of ​​the supercomputer 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.310
 which also develops itself and 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.950
 evolved and everything somehow 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.080
 has access or tells you nee 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.910
 I do not think that's good because 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.440
 this can be helped writes in 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.700
 the comments are justified then can 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.690
 we kind of list my 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.670
 personal rating drops 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.380
 accordingly if the visual 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.230
 In any case, implementation will be doubled 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.150
 and threefold pluses acting 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.680
 but that is just everything rather colorless and 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.540
 on the lower level and the story 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.380
 is completely stupid no tension 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.520
 that's why there are just under three of me 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.930
 ten points I have just yet 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.370
 thoughtfully there is still a fourth no 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.150
 he just does not like that for me 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.800
 carved socks 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.480
 which movie about maybe from the 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.850
 Has carved socks that you can 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.160
 look down here is namely the rigi 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.530
 to the new muppets movie who but I say 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.300
 would rather have some crazy ones 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.920
 film errors in the case I think the last 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.630
 film error video right here below right 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.360
 and then we see you again soon bayer 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.440
 19 criticism here the film factory with me 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.440
 the view
