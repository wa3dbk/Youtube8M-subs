bullet will blow the coupling be between

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.040 
bullet will blow the coupling be between
the<00:00:32.020> trans<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:33.540> take<00:00:34.540> this<00:00:34.630> as<00:00:34.810> your<00:00:34.900> next

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
the trans so take this as your next

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.260 
the trans so take this as your next
cover<00:00:35.350> point<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.860> check<00:00:36.460> out<00:00:36.579> two<00:00:36.970> grenades

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
cover point and check out two grenades

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.520

over<00:00:37.420> there<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.870> should<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.170> able<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.380> take

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
over there you should be able to take

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.080 
over there you should be able to take
out<00:00:38.649> everybody<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.190> then<00:00:39.280> move<00:00:39.460> on<00:00:39.610> safely

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
that guy on the top will never drop down

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.380 
that guy on the top will never drop down
so<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:43.450> have<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.660> do<00:00:43.750> some<00:00:43.930> fire<00:00:44.140> right<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
so you have to do some fire right so

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.299 
so you have to do some fire right so
don't<00:00:47.350> keep<00:00:47.469> your<00:00:47.620> head<00:00:47.739> out<00:00:47.890> there<00:00:48.039> for<00:00:48.190> too

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
don't keep your head out there for too

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.299 
don't keep your head out there for too
long<00:00:48.460> because<00:00:48.760> as<00:00:49.090> you<00:00:49.149> can<00:00:49.210> see<00:00:49.329> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
long because as you can see that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.480 
long because as you can see that
helicopter<00:00:51.309> can<00:00:51.489> unleash<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.879> fury<00:00:52.149> of<00:00:52.359> bullets

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.130 

all<00:00:58.970> right<00:00:59.120> don't<00:00:59.270> always<00:00:59.570> be<00:00:59.720> concerned

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
all right don't always be concerned

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.170 
all right don't always be concerned
about<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.980> helicopter<00:01:01.430> if<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:01.610> pharmacist

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
about the helicopter if it's pharmacist

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.580 
about the helicopter if it's pharmacist
but<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:02.420> you're<00:01:02.570> near<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.870> front<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
but if you're near the front of a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.970 
but if you're near the front of a
platform<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.970> fires<00:01:05.210> them<00:01:05.540> or<00:01:05.810> two<00:01:06.590> direct

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
platform and it fires them or two direct

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.980 
platform and it fires them or two direct
hits<00:01:07.070> will<00:01:07.940> get<00:01:08.420> will<00:01:08.630> result<00:01:09.260> in<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.440> depth<00:01:10.990> so

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
hits will get will result in a depth so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.090 
hits will get will result in a depth so
when<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.200> get<00:01:12.320> up<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.500> slider<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.890> want<00:01:13.040> to

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
when you get up the slider you want to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.210 
when you get up the slider you want to
crawl<00:01:13.280> along<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.520> side<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:16.070> can

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
crawl along the side so that you you can

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.080 
crawl along the side so that you you can
avoid<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.610> signals<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.270> helicopter<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.270 

this<00:01:20.630> may<00:01:20.810> look<00:01:20.960> easy<00:01:21.229> but<00:01:21.500> honestly<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.189> think

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
this may look easy but honestly I think

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.520 
this may look easy but honestly I think
I<00:01:22.490> died<00:01:22.670> here<00:01:22.880> about<00:01:23.030> 20<00:01:23.329> times<00:01:23.509> matter<00:01:24.500> of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
I died here about 20 times matter of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.169 
I died here about 20 times matter of
fact<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.799> had<00:01:24.920> 15<00:01:25.280> minutes<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.579> recorded<00:01:25.939> video

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
fact I had 15 minutes of recorded video

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.669 
fact I had 15 minutes of recorded video
and<00:01:26.359> I<00:01:26.390> had<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> delete<00:01:26.840> all<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.320> because<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
and I had to delete all of it because it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:28.870 
and I had to delete all of it because it
was<00:01:27.710> just<00:01:27.920> me<00:01:28.039> dying<00:01:28.280> here<00:01:28.549> over<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.789> over

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
all right once that's done there's a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.570
