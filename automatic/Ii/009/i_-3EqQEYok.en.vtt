want<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> write<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.950> file<00:01:56.250> manual<00:01:57.000> no

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
want to write down the file manual no

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
want to write down the file manual no
code<00:01:57.509> manually<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.860> bar<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.430> copy

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
code manually into that bar don't copy

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.859 
code manually into that bar don't copy
and<00:01:59.759> paste<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.119> it'll<00:02:00.450> come<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.689> wrong

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and paste because it'll come out wrong

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.819 
and paste because it'll come out wrong
so<00:02:01.829> once<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> manually<00:02:02.700> type<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> want

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
so once you manually type it in you want

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.490 
so once you manually type it in you want
to<00:02:04.890> click<00:02:05.250> Save<00:02:05.520> profile<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:07.099> click<00:02:08.099> Play

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.710 

and<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.280> only<00:02:13.340> reason<00:02:13.490> i<00:02:13.670> had<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.970> XM<00:02:14.450> x<00:02:15.070> 4g<00:02:16.720> in

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
and the only reason i had the XM x 4g in

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.840 
and the only reason i had the XM x 4g in
front<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.140> mine<00:02:18.350> was<00:02:18.590> because<00:02:18.920> after<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.640> say

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
front of mine was because after you say

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.460 
front of mine was because after you say
that<00:02:20.030> it'll<00:02:20.300> load<00:02:20.450> back<00:02:20.660> up<00:02:20.690> manually<00:02:21.200> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that it'll load back up manually and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.850 
that it'll load back up manually and
make<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.860> compatible<00:02:22.490> version<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.540> code

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
make it a compatible version of the code

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.130 
make it a compatible version of the code
with<00:02:24.860> okay<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.430> whatever<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.960> here

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
time I can zoom in Optifine and hope

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.790 
time I can zoom in Optifine and hope
come<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.450> take<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> screenshot<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:45.709> up

come in take a screenshot and you see up

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.500 
come in take a screenshot and you see up
top<00:02:45.980> left<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.580> one<00:02:46.730> point<00:02:46.910> six<00:02:47.090> point<00:02:47.330> four

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
top left it is one point six point four

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.699 
top left it is one point six point four
so<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.230> does<00:02:48.470> work<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:50.470> lagging<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.680> little

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
so this does work and lagging a little

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.900 
so this does work and lagging a little
bit<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:52.160> i'm<00:02:52.310> recording<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.790> screen

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
bit because i'm recording the screen

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.770 
bit because i'm recording the screen
mode<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:54.260> does<00:02:54.500> work<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.850> yeah<00:02:56.000> thank<00:02:56.630> you
