hurricane we're going to add in a layer
of<00:01:12.420> pebbles<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.290> stone<00:01:13.850> today<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> decided<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of pebbles or stone today I decided to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
of pebbles or stone today I decided to
try<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:16.920> great<00:01:17.310> Green<00:01:17.820> River

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
try some of these great Green River

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.800 
try some of these great Green River
stones<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:20.159> add<00:01:20.429> that<00:01:20.460> decorative<00:01:21.270> element

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
stones that add that decorative element

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.800 
stones that add that decorative element
so<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.950> add<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.219> layer<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> layer

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
so we add that layer in and that layer

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.910 
so we add that layer in and that layer
becomes<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.469> drainage<00:01:26.009> layer<00:01:26.869> then<00:01:27.869> next<00:01:28.649> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
becomes a drainage layer then next I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
becomes a drainage layer then next I
have<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.850> four<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.179> a<00:01:30.210> half<00:01:30.240> inch<00:01:30.689> orchid

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
have the four and a half inch orchid

about<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:33.750> direction<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:36.090> wire<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.510> going

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
about what direction the wire is going

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.530 
about what direction the wire is going
because<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.800> can<00:03:37.980> see<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.360> make

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
because you can see that you can make

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.860 
because you can see that you can make
adjustments<00:03:39.660> once<00:03:40.410> you've<00:03:40.710> added<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.870> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
adjustments once you've added it in so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.470 
adjustments once you've added it in so
here's<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.530> same<00:03:43.890> color<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:45.120> brought

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
here's the same color that's brought

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
here's the same color that's brought
together<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.100> can<00:03:47.130> add<00:03:47.460> another

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
together and then we can add another

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850 
together and then we can add another
textural<00:03:48.450> element<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.110> adding<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.710> little

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
textural element just adding a little

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.430 
textural element just adding a little
bit<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.220> contrasting<00:03:51.000> color<00:03:51.300> coming<00:03:52.290> in

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
bit of a contrasting color coming in

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:20.230 
bit of a contrasting color coming in
with<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> purple<00:03:53.040> flat<00:03:53.340> wire

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.240 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.180 

you<00:04:21.240> can<00:04:21.420> see<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> finished<00:04:22.140> product<00:04:22.440> that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you can see the finished product that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.940 
you can see the finished product that
adding<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.940> decorative<00:04:24.330> wire<00:04:24.720> adds<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.770> lot

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
adding that decorative wire adds a lot

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.100 
adding that decorative wire adds a lot
more<00:04:26.010> dimension<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.150> character<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
more dimension and character to the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.740 
more dimension and character to the
design<00:04:28.710> orchid<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.330> become<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.660> very

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
design orchid so this can become a very

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.100 
design orchid so this can become a very
great<00:04:31.230> keepsake<00:04:31.590> gift<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:33.120> match<00:04:33.450> any<00:04:33.900> decor

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
great keepsake gift and match any decor

00:04:34.110 --> 00:05:18.310 
great keepsake gift and match any decor
in<00:04:34.590> any<00:04:34.860> home

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.360 

so<00:05:19.320> these<00:05:19.440> are<00:05:19.650> some<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.010> Finnish

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
so these are some of the Finnish

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.690 
so these are some of the Finnish
examples<00:05:21.030> of<00:05:21.270> orchids<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.110> glass<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.770> hope

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
examples of orchids and glass I hope

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.030 
examples of orchids and glass I hope
you'll<00:05:23.910> take<00:05:24.150> this<00:05:24.360> idea<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:25.170> try<00:05:25.740> out<00:05:25.890> the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
you'll take this idea and try out the

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.670 
you'll take this idea and try out the
mechanics<00:05:26.600> adding<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.750> pebble<00:05:28.050> layer<00:05:28.380> so

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
mechanics adding that pebble layer so

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.950 
mechanics adding that pebble layer so
you<00:05:28.800> have<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:28.980> drainage<00:05:29.340> layer<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.090> then<00:05:30.690> teach

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
you have a drainage layer and then teach

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.260 
you have a drainage layer and then teach
your<00:05:31.200> customers<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.040> easy<00:05:32.310> way<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> care<00:05:33.000> for

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
your customers the easy way to care for

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.510 
your customers the easy way to care for
orchids<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.930> bring<00:05:34.620> them<00:05:34.740> into<00:05:35.040> their<00:05:35.190> home

and have a long lasting life this is

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.480 
and have a long lasting life this is
