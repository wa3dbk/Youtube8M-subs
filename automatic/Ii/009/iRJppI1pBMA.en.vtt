00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you make out of a couple of these I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
you make out of a couple of these I
don't<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.510> exactly<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.110> many<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.950> couple

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
don't know exactly how many and a couple

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
don't know exactly how many and a couple
of<00:00:44.340> these<00:00:44.489> sort<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.600> another<00:00:46.140> reactor

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of these sort of like another reactor

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
of these sort of like another reactor
and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> crafting

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and then you need to use a crafting

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.569 
and then you need to use a crafting
table<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> believe<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.219> then

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
table I believe and you go here and then

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
table I believe and you go here and then
you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> portal<00:00:51.180> gun<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.719> yeah<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you get the portal gun I think yeah you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
you get the portal gun I think yeah you
use<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> three<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.969> after<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.600> craft<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
use two and three so after you craft a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.250 
use two and three so after you craft a
portal<00:00:55.350> gun<00:00:55.550> basically<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.510> walk

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
portal gun basically you can walk

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.639 
portal gun basically you can walk
through<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.570> it's<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.899> still<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> beta<00:01:01.469> so

it's not great and as you can see it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
it's not great and as you can see it's

things like like this watch put that
right<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> port<00:01:32.549> over

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
right there and then put a port over

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
right there and then put a port over
right<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.920> jump<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:36.689> okay

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
right here and if I jump down it okay

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
right here and if I jump down it okay
let's<00:01:37.860> say<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.070> wanted<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> land<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> platform

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
let's say I wanted to land on a platform

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.359 
let's say I wanted to land on a platform
like<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.560> something<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.100> just

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
like right there or something and I just

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
like right there or something and I just
wasn't<00:01:41.759> able<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.229> could<00:01:43.380> just

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
wasn't able to do it like I could just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
wasn't able to do it like I could just
jump<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.220> pro<00:01:44.759> quo<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.259> wouldn't<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
jump and then pro quo see it wouldn't be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.719 
jump and then pro quo see it wouldn't be
good<00:01:46.680> enough<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.579> land

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
good enough I would have to land

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
good enough I would have to land
somewhere<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.829> would

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
somewhere like right there and it would

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.179 
somewhere like right there and it would
work<00:01:50.100> pretty<00:01:50.430> good<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.869> let's<00:01:52.770> test<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
work pretty good so now let's test this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.929 
work pretty good so now let's test this
out<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> yeah<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> landed<00:01:56.880> on

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
out so yeah as you can see I landed on

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.639 
out so yeah as you can see I landed on
the<00:01:57.060> platform<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.960> could<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.170> used<00:01:58.500> for

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the platform so this could be used for

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
the platform so this could be used for
many<00:01:59.100> other<00:01:59.369> things<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.030> instead<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
many other things just instead of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
many other things just instead of
teleporting<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.159> use<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.490> for

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
teleporting or you can use it for

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
teleporting or you can use it for
teleporting<00:02:03.090> let's<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.600> want<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:05.219> Tyler

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
teleporting let's say I want one Tyler

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.340 
teleporting let's say I want one Tyler

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
there's um I remember there was a map it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.040 
there's um I remember there was a map it
was<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.820> wasn't<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:36.390> title<00:02:36.720> boarding

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
was like it wasn't really title boarding

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.020 
was like it wasn't really title boarding
but<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> don't<00:02:38.400> remember<00:02:38.820> the

but it was like you I don't remember the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.340 
but it was like you I don't remember the
name<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.360> map<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.660> let<00:02:39.810> me<00:02:39.870> stop<00:02:40.050> talking

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
name of the map so let me stop talking

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410 
name of the map so let me stop talking
about<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:41.220> yeah<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.060> see<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.270> can

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
about it but yeah as you can see I can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.530 
about it but yeah as you can see I can
drop<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.280> teleporter<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.910> end<00:02:45.390> up

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
drop a teleporter right here and end up

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.760 
drop a teleporter right here and end up
all<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> way<00:02:45.960> back<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.320> where<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.530> came<00:02:46.620> from

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
all the way back there where I came from

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.880 
all the way back there where I came from
a<00:02:47.160> snap<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.900> doesn't<00:02:49.260> work<00:02:49.380> very<00:02:49.410> well

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
a snap see it doesn't work very well

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100 
a snap see it doesn't work very well
especially<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.970> places<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.930> works

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
especially on places like that it works

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.660 
especially on places like that it works
mostly<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.890> floor<00:02:54.050> yeah<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.770> take<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
mostly on the floor yeah I take that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.440 
mostly on the floor yeah I take that
back<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.990> basically<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.450> this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
back so it basically if you have this

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.930 
back so it basically if you have this
material<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.290> down<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.520> get<00:03:02.790> this

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
material you can down you can get this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.310 
material you can down you can get this
mod<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:04.830> works<00:03:05.070> pretty<00:03:05.490> good<00:03:05.990> most<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
mod and it works pretty good most of the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.080 
mod and it works pretty good most of the
time<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.890> time<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.100> doesn't<00:03:08.670> work<00:03:08.850> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
time but the time that doesn't work it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.520 
time but the time that doesn't work it
is<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.830> kills<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.170> doesn't<00:03:13.320> really

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
is it kills you but it doesn't really

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.400 
is it kills you but it doesn't really
