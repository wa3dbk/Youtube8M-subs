00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
next skip cuz body art forms did not

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
next skip cuz body art forms did not
have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> three-fourths<00:01:55.380> paper<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:56.009> am<00:01:56.880> skipping

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have a three-fourths paper I am skipping

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.130 
have a three-fourths paper I am skipping
from<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> 58<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> 78<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:01.020> gonna

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
from a 58 to a 78 so yeah that's gonna

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.609 
from a 58 to a 78 so yeah that's gonna
be<00:02:01.290> fun<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.759> hurt<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
be fun it's gonna hurt a little bit but

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
be fun it's gonna hurt a little bit but
yeah<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.340> basically<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:06.149> slow<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
yeah so you can basically go slow if you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.690 
yeah so you can basically go slow if you
want<00:02:06.869> talk<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.009> went<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> little<00:02:08.489> bit

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
want talk to you I went a little bit

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.510 
want talk to you I went a little bit
fast<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.420> i'm<00:02:09.629> probably<00:02:09.810> gonna<00:02:10.020> slow<00:02:10.259> down

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
fast but i'm probably gonna slow down

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.410 
fast but i'm probably gonna slow down
now<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> show<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> tapers<00:02:12.810> i<00:02:12.900> have

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
now to show you all the tapers i have

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.650 
now to show you all the tapers i have

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
but I know I'm missing a size because i

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.130 
but I know I'm missing a size because i
went<00:04:07.410> from<00:04:07.620> double<00:04:08.220> 0<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.550> half<00:04:08.700> inch<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:10.020> was

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
went from double 0 to half inch that was

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.110 
went from double 0 to half inch that was
another<00:04:10.320> skip<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.800> did<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> did<00:04:11.250> not<00:04:11.280> go<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.610> 716

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
another skip I did I did not go to 716

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.430 
another skip I did I did not go to 716
don't<00:04:15.120> know<00:04:15.270> just<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.930> thought<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.320> was<00:04:16.410> a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
don't know just I thought it was a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.250 
don't know just I thought it was a
pointless<00:04:16.799> stretch<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:18.180> go<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.390> 7<00:04:18.690> 16<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.230> a

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
pointless stretch to go to 7 16 and a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.360 
pointless stretch to go to 7 16 and a
half<00:04:19.290> inch<00:04:19.620> should<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:19.950> jump<00:04:20.010> right<00:04:20.250> to

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
half inch should I just jump right to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.880 
half inch should I just jump right to
half<00:04:20.549> inch<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.090> skipping<00:04:22.019> three<00:04:22.380> fourths<00:04:22.770> is

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
half inch but skipping three fourths is

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.680 
half inch but skipping three fourths is
probably<00:04:23.490> really<00:04:23.790> not<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> good<00:04:24.360> idea<00:04:24.420> for<00:04:24.750> me

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
probably really not a good idea for me

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.260 
probably really not a good idea for me
