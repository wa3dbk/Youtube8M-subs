00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
method like this is full auto regulation

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
method like this is full auto regulation
you<00:01:22.740> come<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> lift<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> are

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you come in and you lift what you are

you come in and you lift what you are
able<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.450> lift<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> day<00:01:25.820> novices<00:01:26.820> should

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
able to lift on the day novices should

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
able to lift on the day novices should
avoid<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.540> type<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> training<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.470> they

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
avoid this type of training because they

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
avoid this type of training because they
need<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> structured<00:01:29.250> program<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> once

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
need a structured program but once

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
need a structured program but once
you've<00:01:31.020> finished<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> novice<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.729> do

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you've finished as a novice you could do

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.130 
you've finished as a novice you could do
something<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> would

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
something like this now what I would

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.760 
something like this now what I would
recommend<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.860> basis<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:36.170> do<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> your

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
recommend is a basis is do all of your

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
recommend is a basis is do all of your
strength<00:01:38.220> work<00:01:38.490> first<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.600> say<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
strength work first and I would say in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
strength work first and I would say in
an<00:01:40.110> average<00:01:40.500> day<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> see

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
an average day I would like to see

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.960 
an average day I would like to see
someone<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.210> five<00:01:42.540> basic<00:01:43.500> movements<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
someone do five basic movements the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
someone do five basic movements the
barbell<00:01:45.390> squat<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.950> deadlift<00:01:48.799> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
barbell squat the deadlift the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.010 
barbell squat the deadlift the
benchpress<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> can't<00:01:51.180> stand<00:01:51.600> bench

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
benchpress and if you can't stand bench

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
benchpress and if you can't stand bench
press<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.649> hate<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.310> weighted

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
press you just hate it then do weighted

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
press you just hate it then do weighted
dips<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.240> decline<00:01:54.720> bench<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.110> something

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
dips or do decline bench or something

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
dips or do decline bench or something
else<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.890> would<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.030> weighted

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
else I would like to see weighted

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940 
else I would like to see weighted
chin-ups<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> think<00:01:58.680> are<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
chin-ups which I think are a good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.359 
chin-ups which I think are a good
complement<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.960> doing<00:02:01.530> high-frequency<00:02:01.860> dead

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
complement to doing high-frequency dead

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.410 
complement to doing high-frequency dead
lifting<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:04.430> some<00:02:05.430> sort<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> overhead<00:02:06.180> press

lifting and some sort of overhead press

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.630 
lifting and some sort of overhead press
ideally<00:02:07.110> I'd<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> push<00:02:08.009> press<00:02:08.340> but

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
ideally I'd like to see a push press but

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
ideally I'd like to see a push press but
if<00:02:08.759> people<00:02:09.179> feel<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.539> need<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
if people feel they need more a little

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.840 
if people feel they need more a little
more<00:02:10.229> delt<00:02:10.679> development

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
more delt development

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.260

really<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:13.520> lateral<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.760> posterior

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
really the lateral and the posterior

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
really the lateral and the posterior
head<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.990> behind<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> neck<00:02:16.590> press<00:02:16.770> would<00:02:17.010> be

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
head the behind the neck press would be

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
head the behind the neck press would be
a<00:02:17.130> better<00:02:17.310> option<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.090> able<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.660> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
a better option if you're able to do it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
a better option if you're able to do it
but<00:02:19.620> those<00:02:19.830> five<00:02:20.250> basic<00:02:20.490> movements<00:02:21.210> will

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
but those five basic movements will

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.860 
but those five basic movements will
build<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:22.110> strength<00:02:22.790> base<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:24.450> will<00:02:24.660> build

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
build your strength base they will build

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.710 
build your strength base they will build
your<00:02:25.020> strength<00:02:25.290> base<00:02:25.560> up<00:02:26.270> they<00:02:27.270> will<00:02:27.480> develop

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
your strength base up they will develop

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.180 
your strength base up they will develop
most<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> muscles<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.830> your<00:02:28.890> body

functionally<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.210> what<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.420> would<00:02:30.570> say<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.930> on

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
functionally now what I would say is on

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.300 
functionally now what I would say is on
each<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.410> those<00:02:31.500> lifts<00:02:31.830> when<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:31.980> come<00:02:32.190> in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
each one of those lifts when you come in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.780 
each one of those lifts when you come in
and<00:02:32.430> train<00:02:32.640> build<00:02:33.540> up<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.320> heavy<00:02:34.710> three<00:02:35.550> to

five reps set with a weight that is very

five reps set with a weight that is very

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
one to ten hour PE scale but that you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.050 
one to ten hour PE scale but that you

can maintain good form without any form
degradation<00:02:48.420> trying<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.080> grind<00:02:49.260> out<00:02:49.470> that

degradation trying to grind out that
last<00:02:49.890> rep<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.210> one<00:02:51.570> heavy<00:02:51.930> work<00:02:52.230> set<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.680> each

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
last rep so one heavy work set of each

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800 
last rep so one heavy work set of each
of<00:02:52.980> those<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.340> you're<00:02:53.730> probably<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.570> well

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
of those on you're probably going well

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.330 
of those on you're probably going well
that<00:02:54.930> may<00:02:55.050> not<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.350> enough<00:02:55.620> yeah<00:02:55.830> one<00:02:56.070> heavy

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that may not be enough yeah one heavy

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.010 
that may not be enough yeah one heavy
work<00:02:56.550> set<00:02:56.760> will<00:02:56.910> stimulate<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.420> decent<00:02:57.960> amount

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
work set will stimulate a decent amount

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.620 
work set will stimulate a decent amount
of<00:02:58.260> growth<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:59.520> will<00:02:59.760> stimulate<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.270> decent

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
of growth it will stimulate a decent

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.620 
of growth it will stimulate a decent
amount<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.870> strength<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.240> set<00:03:03.510> is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
amount of strength but it the one set is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
amount of strength but it the one set is
not<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.170> impede<00:03:04.440> your<00:03:04.590> recovery<00:03:05.100> that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
not going to impede your recovery that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.620 
not going to impede your recovery that
much<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.820> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> come<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.450> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
much so if you want to come in and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.320 
much so if you want to come in and
deadlift<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.470> squat<00:03:08.400> three<00:03:08.760> days<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> row

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
deadlift and squat three days in a row

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.640 
deadlift and squat three days in a row
back<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.600> back<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.020> back<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.320> can<00:03:10.440> get<00:03:10.530> away

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
back to back to back you can get away

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.950 
back to back to back you can get away
with<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.100> because<00:03:11.190> you've<00:03:11.490> only<00:03:11.670> done<00:03:11.880> one<00:03:12.480> set

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
with it because you've only done one set

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.780 
with it because you've only done one set
and<00:03:13.590> because<00:03:14.100> you're<00:03:14.220> doing<00:03:14.340> high-frequency

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
and because you're doing high-frequency

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.850 
and because you're doing high-frequency
training<00:03:15.540> your<00:03:15.720> muscle<00:03:16.020> protein<00:03:16.380> synthesis

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
training your muscle protein synthesis

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.980 
training your muscle protein synthesis
will<00:03:17.040> stay<00:03:17.220> elevated<00:03:17.490> all<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.060> time<00:03:18.330> training

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
will stay elevated all the time training

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.510 
will stay elevated all the time training
on<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.170> high<00:03:19.290> frequency<00:03:19.890> which<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.310> one

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
on the high frequency which is that one

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.300 
on the high frequency which is that one
heavy<00:03:20.790> work<00:03:21.030> set<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.830> those<00:03:22.830> five<00:03:23.100> basic

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
heavy work set and those five basic

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940 
heavy work set and those five basic
movements<00:03:23.850> will<00:03:23.970> cover<00:03:24.150> most<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.720> now<00:03:25.590> what

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
movements will cover most of it now what

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.770 
movements will cover most of it now what
I<00:03:25.980> would<00:03:26.100> say<00:03:26.370> after<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> lot<00:03:27.510> of

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
I would say after that because a lot of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.450 
I would say after that because a lot of
guys<00:03:27.930> are<00:03:28.140> concerned<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.830> their<00:03:28.980> aesthetics

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
guys are concerned with their aesthetics

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.330 
guys are concerned with their aesthetics
not<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:29.940> purely<00:03:30.480> functional<00:03:31.470> hypertrophy

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
not with purely functional hypertrophy

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.310 
not with purely functional hypertrophy
and<00:03:32.460> strength<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.360> would<00:03:33.600> say<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:33.990> at

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
and strength what I would say is that at

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.780 
and strength what I would say is that at
the<00:03:34.410> end<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.830> each<00:03:35.010> session<00:03:35.250> after<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> do

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the end of each session after you do

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.900 
the end of each session after you do
those<00:03:35.940> five<00:03:36.180> movements<00:03:37.310> whatever<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.580> think

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
those five movements whatever you think

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.570 
those five movements whatever you think
are<00:03:39.030> your<00:03:39.300> worst<00:03:39.540> muscle<00:03:40.050> groups<00:03:40.580> whether

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
are your worst muscle groups whether

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.520 
are your worst muscle groups whether
it's<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.030> long<00:03:42.240> head<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.570> your<00:03:42.660> tricep<00:03:43.290> or

in and do them and you could do

then on top of that at the end of every
session<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.890> would<00:04:47.950> recommend<00:04:48.490> doing<00:04:48.580> some

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
sort of heavy core work like you guys

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.060 
sort of heavy core work like you guys
see<00:04:50.860> me<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:51.190> either<00:04:52.110> cable<00:04:53.110> crunches<00:04:53.830> or

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
your core every single day also and it's

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.530 
your core every single day also and it's
that<00:05:02.020> easy<00:05:02.230> that<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:02.830> how<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.430> would<00:05:03.820> use<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.150> full

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
that easy that is how I would use a full

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.960 
that easy that is how I would use a full

and take someone and get them very
strong<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:10.450> that<00:05:10.480> they're<00:05:10.780> very<00:05:11.050> powerful<00:05:11.380> and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
strong so that they're very powerful and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.070 
strong so that they're very powerful and
strong<00:05:11.920> enough<00:05:12.430> functional<00:05:12.940> strength<00:05:13.360> but

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
strong enough functional strength but

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.290 
strong enough functional strength but
still<00:05:14.680> have<00:05:15.070> what<00:05:15.580> they<00:05:15.700> would<00:05:15.880> consider<00:05:15.970> a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
still have what they would consider a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.240 
still have what they would consider a
relatively<00:05:16.810> balanced<00:05:17.410> aesthetic<00:05:17.890> physique

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
relatively balanced aesthetic physique

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.890 
relatively balanced aesthetic physique
and<00:05:18.550> some<00:05:18.790> people<00:05:19.060> could<00:05:19.180> train<00:05:19.390> this<00:05:19.540> way<00:05:19.720> and

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
and some people could train this way and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.020 
and some people could train this way and
still<00:05:20.230> compete<00:05:21.070> very<00:05:21.250> successfully<00:05:21.910> as<00:05:22.000> a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
still compete very successfully as a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.880 
still compete very successfully as a
bodybuilder<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.870> depends<00:05:23.200> on<00:05:23.290> how<00:05:23.470> well<00:05:23.710> they

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
bodybuilder it depends on how well they

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.470 
bodybuilder it depends on how well they
balance<00:05:24.280> out<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.490> refinement<00:05:25.120> and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
balance out that refinement and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.180 
balance out that refinement and
aesthetic<00:05:26.020> work<00:05:26.170> at<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.440> end<00:05:26.650> versus

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
aesthetic work at the end versus

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.800 
aesthetic work at the end versus
whatever<00:05:27.400> imbalances<00:05:28.090> they're<00:05:28.270> developing

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
whatever imbalances they're developing

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.460 
whatever imbalances they're developing
due<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:30.160> primary<00:05:30.670> heavy<00:05:31.170> compound<00:05:32.170> work

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
due to the primary heavy compound work

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.880 
due to the primary heavy compound work
and<00:05:33.480> it's<00:05:34.480> really<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.960> simple<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.560> that's

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
and it's really that simple and that's

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.440 
and it's really that simple and that's
really<00:05:36.190> all<00:05:36.400> I<00:05:36.430> have<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.820> say<00:05:36.850> on<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.120> today<00:05:37.420> I

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
really all I have to say on that today I

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.450 
really all I have to say on that today I
hope<00:05:37.750> it<00:05:37.930> has<00:05:38.020> been<00:05:38.050> informative<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:39.070> I<00:05:39.250> will

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
hope it has been informative and I will

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490 
hope it has been informative and I will
talk<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.790> you<00:05:39.880> next<00:05:40.120> time<00:05:40.390> but<00:05:41.080> let<00:05:41.260> me<00:05:41.350> give

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
talk to you next time but let me give

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.629 
talk to you next time but let me give
you<00:05:41.620> guys<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.830> bicep<00:05:42.310> shot<00:05:42.520> first

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639
