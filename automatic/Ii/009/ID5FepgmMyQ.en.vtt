of<00:00:42.600> course<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.260> well<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.010> stream<00:00:44.460> depends

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
of course how well these stream depends

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
of course how well these stream depends
on<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.840> internet<00:00:46.140> connection<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:47.010> the

on your internet connection at the

from<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:51.000> work<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.629> well<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.170> long

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
from but these do work very well as long

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.020 
from but these do work very well as long
as<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> decent<00:00:53.190> internet<00:00:53.850> connection

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
as you have a decent internet connection

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.529 
as you have a decent internet connection
these<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:54.960> stream<00:00:55.410> 1080p<00:00:56.340> signals<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.180> major

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
these do stream 1080p signals the major

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.349 
these do stream 1080p signals the major
difference<00:00:58.260> between<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:58.949> boxes<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
difference between the two boxes is that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.609 
difference between the two boxes is that
the<00:01:00.870> higher-end<00:01:01.859> 500<00:01:02.670> has<00:01:03.000> built-in<00:01:03.570> Wi-Fi<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the higher-end 500 has built-in Wi-Fi it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.880 
the higher-end 500 has built-in Wi-Fi it
also<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.339> an<00:01:05.610> HDMI<00:01:06.420> pass-through<00:01:06.780> port<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
also has an HDMI pass-through port that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
also has an HDMI pass-through port that
allows<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> connect<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.210> cable

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
allows you to connect this to your cable

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
allows you to connect this to your cable
or<00:01:10.170> satellite<00:01:10.229> box<00:01:10.619> via<00:01:11.549> HDMI<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
or satellite box via HDMI one of the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
or satellite box via HDMI one of the
problems<00:01:13.680> however<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.070> those<00:01:14.430> boxes<00:01:14.939> often

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
problems however is those boxes often

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.590 
problems however is those boxes often
output<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.259> signal<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.430> copy-protected

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
output a signal that is copy-protected

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
output a signal that is copy-protected
which<00:01:19.049> prevents<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.490> seeing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
which prevents you from actually seeing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
which prevents you from actually seeing
the<00:01:21.060> video<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.080> Slingbox<00:01:22.560> recommends<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the video so Slingbox recommends that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
the video so Slingbox recommends that
you<00:01:23.310> also<00:01:23.610> connect<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> via<00:01:24.570> component

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you also connect this via component

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
you also connect this via component
video<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> 500<00:01:27.180> does<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
video because the 500 does have that

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.700 
video because the 500 does have that
HDMI<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> sling<00:01:30.930> projector

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
HDMI out and can do the sling projector

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.399 
HDMI out and can do the sling projector
it<00:01:32.189> does<00:01:32.549> come<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.180> remote<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.200> allows

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it does come with a remote that allows

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
it does come with a remote that allows
you<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> control<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.159> feature<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you to control that feature and to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
you to control that feature and to
control<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> on-screen<00:01:36.990> menus<00:01:37.439> both<00:01:38.310> these

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
control the on-screen menus both these

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.690 
control the on-screen menus both these
boxes<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.420> built-in<00:01:39.990> IR<00:01:40.290> blasters<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.610> if

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
boxes have built-in IR blasters so if

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.490 
boxes have built-in IR blasters so if
you<00:01:41.820> set<00:01:42.060> them<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.299> top<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.960> cable<00:01:43.290> box

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you set them on top of your cable box

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
you set them on top of your cable box
they<00:01:44.340> should<00:01:44.670> change<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.299> channels<00:01:45.720> remotely

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
they should change the channels remotely

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
they should change the channels remotely
so<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> big<00:01:46.950> question<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.549> which<00:01:47.909> box<00:01:48.390> should

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
so the big question is which box should

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.719 
so the big question is which box should
you<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> worth<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> step<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you get and is it worth it to step up to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.929 
you get and is it worth it to step up to
the<00:01:50.850> 500<00:01:51.360> model<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.770> say<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.700> some

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the 500 model I would say for some

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.760 
the 500 model I would say for some
people<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.420> won't<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.320> recommending

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
people it won't be we are recommending

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.340 
people it won't be we are recommending
300<00:01:56.729> does<00:01:56.850> everything<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> fiber<00:01:57.990> does

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
300 does everything that the fiber does

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
300 does everything that the fiber does
however<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.399> scenario<00:01:59.700> where<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> think

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
however the one scenario where I think

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.090 
however the one scenario where I think
it'd<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.600> important<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> step<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.009> the
