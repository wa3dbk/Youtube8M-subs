00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
going down pretty big in the loops and

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.900 
going down pretty big in the loops and
kind<00:00:27.580> of<00:00:27.670> brought<00:00:27.880> up<00:00:28.060> an<00:00:28.210> old<00:00:28.359> injury<00:00:28.720> and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.710 
kind of brought up an old injury and
struggled<00:00:30.910> with<00:00:30.939> that<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.359> little<00:00:31.630> bit

throughout the night third practice

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.390 
throughout the night third practice
wasn't<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.000> best<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.390> know<00:00:34.480> like<00:00:34.690> I<00:00:34.809> said<00:00:34.989> I

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
wasn't the best you know like I said I

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.640 
wasn't the best you know like I said I
kind<00:00:36.400> of<00:00:36.489> brought<00:00:37.150> up<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.480> an<00:00:37.840> old<00:00:38.050> injury<00:00:38.379> and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
kind of brought up a an old injury and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.130 
kind of brought up a an old injury and
sort<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.489> dealing<00:00:39.730> with<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.970> again<00:00:40.330> and<00:00:40.510> and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
sort of dealing with that again and and

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.290 
sort of dealing with that again and and
then<00:00:41.470> I've<00:00:42.430> needed<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.730> make<00:00:42.850> some<00:00:42.879> changes<00:00:43.120> to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
then I've needed to make some changes to

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.459 
then I've needed to make some changes to
the<00:00:43.390> bike<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:43.840> made<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.110> changes<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
the bike so we made the changes to the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.470 
the bike so we made the changes to the
bike<00:00:44.680> went<00:00:44.980> out<00:00:45.040> for<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.280> heat<00:00:45.430> race<00:00:45.579> awesome

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
starting the heat race good heat race

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.010 
starting the heat race good heat race
and<00:00:47.980> I<00:00:48.040> ran<00:00:48.219> second<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.090> I<00:00:49.270> was<00:00:49.750> happy

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
and I ran second that and I was happy

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.869 
and I ran second that and I was happy
with<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:51.129> whole<00:00:51.309> time<00:00:51.579> throughout

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
with that on the whole time throughout

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.459 
with that on the whole time throughout
the<00:00:52.030> heat<00:00:52.180> race<00:00:52.360> I<00:00:52.510> felt<00:00:52.960> like<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.170> got<00:00:53.200> better

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
the heat race I felt like I got better

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.900 
the heat race I felt like I got better
and<00:00:53.620> better<00:00:53.680> so<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.550> was<00:00:54.640> really<00:00:54.790> looking

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
and better so I was really looking

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.270 
and better so I was really looking
forward<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> main<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.750> then<00:00:56.039> main<00:00:57.039> event

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
forward to the main and then main event

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.979 
forward to the main and then main event
came<00:00:57.430> around<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.000> didn't<00:00:58.480> get<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.629> good<00:00:58.750> start

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
came around and didn't get a good start

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.130 
came around and didn't get a good start
which<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.649> shame<00:01:00.640> because<00:01:00.879> I<00:01:01.329> do<00:01:01.719> so<00:01:02.050> many

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
which is a shame because I do so many

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.170 
which is a shame because I do so many
starts<00:01:02.530> now<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:03.219> feel<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.789> god<00:01:03.940> I'm<00:01:04.030> so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
starts now and I feel like I god I'm so

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.520 
starts now and I feel like I god I'm so
good<00:01:04.390> but<00:01:04.570> obviously<00:01:04.930> has<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.140> have<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> few

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
good but obviously has to have a few

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.380 
good but obviously has to have a few
things<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.890> can<00:01:06.070> perfect<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.910> little<00:01:07.090> bit<00:01:07.210> more

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
things I can perfect a little bit more

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.290 
things I can perfect a little bit more
and<00:01:07.570> then<00:01:08.190> ended<00:01:09.190> up<00:01:09.250> jamming<00:01:09.729> my<00:01:09.820> wrist<00:01:10.000> again

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
and then ended up jamming my wrist again

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.840 
and then ended up jamming my wrist again
second<00:01:10.930> lap<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> main<00:01:11.530> event<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.130> then<00:01:12.820> I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
second lap of the main event and then I

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.070 
second lap of the main event and then I
had<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.149> struggle<00:01:13.360> with<00:01:13.570> that<00:01:13.690> throughout<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
had to struggle with that throughout the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.690 
had to struggle with that throughout the
main<00:01:14.259> so<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.560> think<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.950> few<00:01:15.130> things<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.460> should

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
main so I think a few things I should

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.030 
main so I think a few things I should
have<00:01:15.729> done<00:01:15.820> differently<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.920> little

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
have done differently to to be a little

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.469 
have done differently to to be a little
bit<00:01:18.159> more<00:01:18.280> prepared<00:01:18.400> for<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> main<00:01:18.970> event<00:01:19.000> but

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
bit more prepared for the main event but

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.179 
bit more prepared for the main event but
it<00:01:19.689> was<00:01:19.840> something<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.590> felt<00:01:20.890> like<00:01:21.010> I

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
it was something that I felt like I

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.210 
it was something that I felt like I
could<00:01:21.369> kind<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.090> manage<00:01:22.420> without<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
could kind of manage without it so you

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.070 
could kind of manage without it so you
know<00:01:24.340> go<00:01:24.549> back<00:01:24.700> home<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.030> week<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.540> do<00:01:26.049> a
