now when it comes to letting a tire
pressures<00:00:37.930> down<00:00:38.199> there's<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.860> number<00:00:39.010> of

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
pressures down there's a number of

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.829 
pressures down there's a number of
different<00:00:39.220> things<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.730> can<00:00:39.940> use<00:00:39.970> there's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
different things you can use there's

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.240 
different things you can use there's
nothing<00:00:41.110> wrong<00:00:41.260> with<00:00:41.470> using<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:41.860> cheap<00:00:42.040> tire

pressure<00:00:42.519> gauge<00:00:42.640> you'd<00:00:43.000> get<00:00:43.150> from<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.360> survey

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
pressure gauge you'd get from a survey

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.750 
pressure gauge you'd get from a survey
but<00:00:44.260> if<00:00:44.379> you<00:00:44.440> want<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.680> be<00:00:44.769> a<00:00:44.800> lot<00:00:45.010> quicker<00:00:45.309> with

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
but if you want to be a lot quicker with

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.250 
but if you want to be a lot quicker with
these<00:00:45.970> haider<00:00:46.239> flatters<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.050> great

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
these haider flatters the great

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.140 
these haider flatters the great
advantages<00:00:47.739> they<00:00:47.890> have<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.820> can<00:00:48.940> put

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
advantages they have is that you can put

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.970 
advantages they have is that you can put
all<00:00:49.329> four<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:49.989> let<00:00:50.140> all<00:00:50.260> four<00:00:50.500> tires<00:00:50.769> down

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
all four on and let all four tires down

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.099 
all four on and let all four tires down
at<00:00:51.159> once<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:51.579> it's<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.760> lot<00:00:51.940> quicker<00:00:52.210> but<00:00:52.899> when

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
at once so it's a lot quicker but when

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.510 
at once so it's a lot quicker but when
you're<00:00:53.230> using<00:00:53.440> them<00:00:53.680> make<00:00:53.949> sure<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.370> adjust

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
you're using them make sure you adjust

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.910 
you're using them make sure you adjust
each<00:00:54.969> one<00:00:55.239> identical<00:00:55.809> or<00:00:56.109> else<00:00:56.440> you'll<00:00:56.739> have

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
each one identical or else you'll have

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.799 
each one identical or else you'll have
one<00:00:57.129> tire<00:00:57.399> 8<00:00:57.609> psi<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.329> other<00:00:58.449> one<00:00:58.629> might
