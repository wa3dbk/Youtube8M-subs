00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
actually there they were originally

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.499 
actually there they were originally
started<00:00:25.869> they're<00:00:25.989> African<00:00:26.349> American

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
started they're African American

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.609 
started they're African American
originated<00:00:28.509> from<00:00:28.630> African<00:00:29.079> American<00:00:29.439> hair

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
originated from African American hair

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.460 
originated from African American hair
and<00:00:29.860> they<00:00:30.279> were<00:00:30.340> actually<00:00:30.939> first<00:00:31.660> started<00:00:32.200> for

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
and they were actually first started for

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.590 
and they were actually first started for
curl<00:00:32.710> Reformation<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.730> curls<00:00:34.059> are<00:00:34.210> too<00:00:34.360> tight

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
curl Reformation and curls are too tight

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.389 
curl Reformation and curls are too tight
this<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:34.989> supposed<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.260> help<00:00:35.410> loosen<00:00:35.860> them<00:00:36.220> up

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
this is supposed to help loosen them up

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.509 
this is supposed to help loosen them up
so<00:00:36.579> they're<00:00:36.790> not<00:00:36.970> so<00:00:37.210> tight<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.809> then<00:00:38.519> we've

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
so they're not so tight and then we've

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.180 
so they're not so tight and then we've
started<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:40.090> use<00:00:40.269> them<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.750> in<00:00:41.739> our<00:00:41.890> culture

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
started to use them and in our culture

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.069 
started to use them and in our culture
more<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.910> create<00:00:43.719> some<00:00:44.199> curl<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:45.839> think<00:00:46.839> it<00:00:46.929> does

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
more to create some curl I think it does

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.439 
more to create some curl I think it does
better<00:00:47.350> my<00:00:48.070> personal<00:00:48.670> opinion<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.179> it

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
better my personal opinion is that it

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.939 
better my personal opinion is that it
does<00:00:49.600> better<00:00:49.780> at<00:00:49.960> curl<00:00:50.140> Reformation<00:00:50.920> for

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
does better at curl Reformation for

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.069 
does better at curl Reformation for
curls<00:00:51.429> that<00:00:51.550> are<00:00:51.699> too<00:00:51.850> tight<00:00:52.149> I<00:00:52.510> don't

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
curls that are too tight I don't

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.079 
curls that are too tight I don't
necessarily<00:00:53.620> like<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.489> curls<00:00:54.789> that<00:00:54.940> it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
necessarily like the curls that it

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.430 
necessarily like the curls that it
creates<00:00:55.420> but<00:00:55.690> we're<00:00:55.809> going<00:00:55.899> to<00:00:55.960> go<00:00:56.109> ahead<00:00:56.199> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
creates but we're going to go ahead and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.930 
creates but we're going to go ahead and
do<00:00:56.589> this<00:00:56.739> tutorial<00:00:56.949> since<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.609> has<00:00:57.730> been

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
do this tutorial since it has been

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.290 
do this tutorial since it has been
requested<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.749> hopefully<00:00:59.429> you<00:01:00.429> can<00:01:00.640> decide

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
requested and hopefully you can decide

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700 
requested and hopefully you can decide
for<00:01:01.329> yourself<00:01:01.510> if<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:02.019> like<00:01:02.170> them<00:01:02.379> or<00:01:02.499> if<00:01:02.589> you

with like the bantu knots is your

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.240 
with like the bantu knots is your
parting<00:01:09.220> because<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:10.630> dries<00:01:11.250> you're

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
parting because when it dries you're

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.770 
parting because when it dries you're
going<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.460> have<00:01:12.670> those<00:01:12.850> partings<00:01:13.479> very

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
going to have those partings very

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.620 
going to have those partings very
definite<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.009> could<00:01:15.340> do<00:01:15.549> squares<00:01:16.180> you

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
definite so you could do squares you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.719 
definite so you could do squares you
could<00:01:16.840> do<00:01:17.020> diamond<00:01:17.799> shapes<00:01:18.100> we're<00:01:18.460> kind<00:01:18.670> of

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
doing it mostly just triangles so that

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.179 
doing it mostly just triangles so that
we<00:01:24.159> can<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.960> those<00:01:26.170> parts<00:01:26.590> hide<00:01:26.799> each<00:01:26.979> other

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
we can have those parts hide each other

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.260 
we can have those parts hide each other
and<00:01:27.430> all<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:27.790> do<00:01:28.079> you<00:01:29.079> part<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.439> out<00:01:29.969> you<00:01:30.969> twist

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
and all you do you part it out you twist

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630 
it you start to fold it down over itself
you<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.000> keep<00:01:37.180> twisting<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.399> her<00:01:39.399> hair

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
Redken crystal curls just to try to help

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.410 
Redken crystal curls just to try to help
give<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.469> some<00:01:50.649> curl<00:01:50.890> because<00:01:51.700> her<00:01:52.000> hair<00:01:52.240> as

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
using this to reform the curl and to

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.450 
using this to reform the curl and to
make<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.719> softer<00:02:08.170> curl<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:09.009> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> hold

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
make it a softer curl it's going to hold

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.710 
make it a softer curl it's going to hold
on<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.729> itself<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.149> don't<00:02:10.360> have<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.630> do

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
down so that you can see how much curl

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.770 
down so that you can see how much curl
this<00:02:35.500> creates<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.340> look<00:02:36.580> creates<00:02:36.940> that's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
this creates this look creates that's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.110 
this creates this look creates that's
one<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.050> my<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.710> not<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.610> my<00:02:39.760> favorite

one of my it's not one of my favorite
kinds<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.510> curl<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.050> not<00:02:41.200> very

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
kinds of curl because it's not very

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.050 
kinds of curl because it's not very
consistent<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.130> very<00:02:42.490> tight<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:42.970> it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
consistent it is very tight and it

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.330 
consistent it is very tight and it
requires<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.510> lot<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.960> kind<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.590> relaxing<00:02:45.190> to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
requires a lot of kind of relaxing to
