model<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:23.800> paid<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:26.199> 1200<00:00:27.199> for<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:27.529> my<00:00:28.220> first<00:00:28.489> bike

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
model I paid a 1200 for it my first bike

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.240 
model I paid a 1200 for it my first bike
so<00:00:30.020> my<00:00:30.169> first<00:00:30.380> bike<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:30.710> figured<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:31.040> would<00:00:31.160> get

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
so my first bike I figured I would get

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.889 
so my first bike I figured I would get
something<00:00:31.520> small<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.149> didn't<00:00:32.509> want<00:00:32.689> anything

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899

something small I didn't want anything
that<00:00:33.320> was<00:00:34.090> too<00:00:35.090> big<00:00:35.329> I<00:00:35.600> actually<00:00:36.110> wanted<00:00:36.559> a

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
that was too big I actually wanted a

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.750 
that was too big I actually wanted a
Suzuki<00:00:37.100> em-50

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
Suzuki em-50

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.639 
Suzuki em-50
actually<00:00:38.750> still<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.110> bike<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:39.469> actually

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
actually still the bike that I actually

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.660 
actually still the bike that I actually
really<00:00:40.190> want<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:41.530> um<00:00:42.530> being<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.370> beginning

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
really want but um being a beginning

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.060 
really want but um being a beginning
writer<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:44.239> know<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.530> would<00:00:45.620> just<00:00:45.710> be<00:00:45.829> too

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
writer I know that it would just be too

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.169 
writer I know that it would just be too
much<00:00:46.100> for<00:00:46.399> me<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.550> get<00:00:46.760> right<00:00:46.969> now

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
much for me to get right now

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.229 
much for me to get right now
so<00:00:49.780> figure<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:50.809> out<00:00:50.899> get<00:00:51.140> something<00:00:51.530> smaller

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
so figure it out get something smaller

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
so figure it out get something smaller

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
500 CC's 2001 model 3800 miles
and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.249 

it's<00:01:05.850> pretty<00:01:06.149> nice<00:01:08.750> thinking<00:01:09.750> maybe<00:01:09.899> I<00:01:10.020> might

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
it's pretty nice thinking maybe I might

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:26.529 
it's pretty nice thinking maybe I might
have<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> back<00:01:10.950> tire<00:01:21.619> belt<00:01:22.619> drive

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.330 

gotta<00:01:27.539> see<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.140> exactly<00:01:28.439> sure<00:01:28.679> how<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.039> is<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
gotta see not exactly sure how it is you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.300 
gotta see not exactly sure how it is you
know<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.970> measure<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.840> measure<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.829> tire<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
know I measure to measure the tire to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.730 
know I measure to measure the tire to
actually<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.939> whether<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.539> or<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
actually see whether or not or when I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.570 
actually see whether or not or when I
would<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.119> tire<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.580> that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
would need to put a tire on but that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.940 
would need to put a tire on but that
kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.709> does<00:01:40.890> look<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> little

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
kind of that kind of does look a little

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.940 
kind of that kind of does look a little
look<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.039> little<00:01:44.069> low<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.709> maybe<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:46.830> ought<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
look a little low so maybe it ought to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
look a little low so maybe it ought to
be<00:01:47.069> something<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.670> I'll<00:01:47.789> look<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.439> put<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
be something that I'll look into put a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.109 
be something that I'll look into put a
tire<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.039> there<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.429> front<00:01:50.610> tire<00:01:50.880> doesn't
