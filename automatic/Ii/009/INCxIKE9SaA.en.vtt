00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
ballpark figure so the ones I am going

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.420 
ballpark figure so the ones I am going
to<00:01:02.930> put<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.410> are<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.800> ones<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:04.159> recommend

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
to put in are the ones that I recommend

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.370 
to put in are the ones that I recommend
so<00:01:04.879> you<00:01:04.939> can<00:01:05.089> certainly<00:01:05.239> copy<00:01:05.600> them<00:01:05.869> see<00:01:06.320> how

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so you can certainly copy them see how

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.270 
so you can certainly copy them see how
it<00:01:06.530> goes<00:01:06.710> on<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:08.649> change<00:01:09.649> them<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.070> want

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
it goes on and change them if you want

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.620 
it goes on and change them if you want
to<00:01:10.460> see<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> first<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.119> is<00:01:11.329> ten<00:01:11.899> point<00:01:13.630> five

the<00:02:03.079> battery<00:02:03.409> it's<00:02:03.560> minimum<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.310> you'll

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
the battery it's minimum and you'll

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.399 
the battery it's minimum and you'll
wreck<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.909> battery<00:02:05.299> if<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.479> just<00:02:05.659> discharged

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
wreck the battery if you just discharged

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.790 
wreck the battery if you just discharged
it<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.889> low<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:08.090> these<00:02:08.619> values<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.830> said<00:02:10.340> at

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
it to low so these values I said at

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.220 
it to low so these values I said at
10.20<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.790> again<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.690> lot<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:16.420> 0.20<00:02:17.420> equals

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
10.20 and again a lot of 0.20 equals

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.970 
10.20 and again a lot of 0.20 equals
that<00:02:18.470> again<00:02:19.010> return

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that again return

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.210 
that again return
that's<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:21.379> Bogdan<00:02:22.379> another<00:02:22.800> things<00:02:23.069> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
that's that Bogdan another things you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
that's that Bogdan another things you
need<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.790> well<00:02:23.970> depending<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.629> how<00:02:24.840> many

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
need to do as well depending on how many

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.390 
need to do as well depending on how many
cells<00:02:25.560> you're<00:02:25.799> running<00:02:26.040> though<00:02:26.159> these

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
cells you're running though these

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080 
cells you're running though these
settings<00:02:26.819> are<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.360> three<00:02:27.840> cell<00:02:28.409> not<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.610> cell

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
settings are for three cell not for cell

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.210 
settings are for three cell not for cell
as<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:30.720> generally<00:02:31.230> build<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> models<00:02:31.860> on

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
as I generally build on the models on

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160 
as I generally build on the models on
three<00:02:32.549> cell<00:02:32.849> if<00:02:33.239> you're<00:02:33.420> running<00:02:33.599> for<00:02:33.900> sale

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
three cell if you're running for sale

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.350 
three cell if you're running for sale
what<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.159> is<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.549> tick<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
what you can do is you can tick the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.270 
what you can do is you can tick the
figures<00:02:36.720> I've<00:02:36.900> got<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:38.069> basically

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
figures I've got and you basically

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.280 
figures I've got and you basically
divide<00:02:38.879> them<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.150> work<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> extra

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
divide them and work out what the extra

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
divide them and work out what the extra
cell<00:02:40.470> would<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.099> can<00:02:41.190> drop<00:02:41.580> down<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
cell would be so you can drop down you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.640 
cell would be so you can drop down you
go<00:02:42.239> all<00:02:42.360> your<00:02:42.569> various<00:02:42.959> cell<00:02:43.170> types<00:02:43.200> but

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
go all your various cell types but

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.559 
go all your various cell types but
normally<00:02:44.010> might<00:02:44.220> multirotors<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.299> either

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
normally might multirotors it's either

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.110 
normally might multirotors it's either
three<00:02:45.810> or<00:02:45.840> four<00:02:46.200> cell<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.790> one

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
three or four cell and this is this one

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
three or four cell and this is this one
another<00:02:48.629> little<00:02:49.170> when<00:02:49.530> you've<00:02:49.680> got<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.040> is

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
another little when you've got here is

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.280 
another little when you've got here is
it<00:02:50.310> basically<00:02:50.909> our<00:02:51.000> battery<00:02:51.390> calibration

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it basically our battery calibration

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.990 
it basically our battery calibration
here<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.040> helps<00:02:53.430> calibrate<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
here and it just helps calibrate the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.110 
here and it just helps calibrate the
battery's<00:02:54.660> voltage<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.610> actual<00:02:56.940> voltage

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
battery's voltage and the actual voltage

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.740 
battery's voltage and the actual voltage
to<00:02:57.510> what<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:57.900> reading<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.819> that's<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.209> for

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
to what it's reading and that's that for

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.519 
to what it's reading and that's that for
the<00:03:01.049> battery<00:03:01.890> one
