look at I show you exactly how I do it
but<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> beautiful<00:00:41.100> rose<00:00:41.550> effect

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but this one is a beautiful rose effect

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.569 
but this one is a beautiful rose effect
I<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> most<00:00:43.559> realistic<00:00:44.100> Rose

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I think it's the most realistic Rose

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
I think it's the most realistic Rose
effect<00:00:45.950> there<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> Wilton

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
effect there we go so that is the Wilton

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.319 
effect there we go so that is the Wilton
2d<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.090> little

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
2d and this is the to see it's a little

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.580 
2d and this is the to see it's a little
bit<00:00:57.449> closer<00:00:57.690> together<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.760> it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.120> open

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
bit closer together so it's not as open

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.479 
bit closer together so it's not as open
it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.070> effect<00:01:03.979> there<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's not a pretty effect there we go and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's not a pretty effect there we go and
that's<00:01:05.549> absolutely<00:01:05.729> beautiful<00:01:06.060> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
