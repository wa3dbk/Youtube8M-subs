00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.020

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.200
 it does not reach the box in the house anymore 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.200
 my friend 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 it's so good that I take things we're going to 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.500
 catch elements for alchemy 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.500
 to catch my stolen items and know 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.240
 I can not take everything without taking the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.610
 portions that take the functions the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.210
 functions are useless they do not serve 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 nothing 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.409
 I continue without waiting 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.409
 and break my head and fuck fuck 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.020
 since I'm in a handsome handsome tutorial 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.020
 Let's see 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 you have seen how pretty the hermitage of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 nines you have seen how pretty 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.190
 good to do the alchemy tutorial 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 as you well know we need four 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.450
 objects are worth these four 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 mortars detonator this is not done 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.780
 this if it has another name is not 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 returned I think good mortar and March 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.800
 almost nador this and this has other 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.950
 names if I'm not wrong 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.870
 well this can be found 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 you can find in the caves and they weigh 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.580
 quite the truth that this a magician this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 it weighs a lot of friends after what 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 you always have a drawer in the house well 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.860
 so we click on this in any 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.600
 good thing these are 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.930
 the operation is practically the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.450
 same as with to create a weapon we put 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.450
 the potion ingredients effects 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.620
 well look let's add let's add 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.970
 an ingredient we are going to make them 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.640
 substitutes 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.220
 You see that it puts against fatigue and harm 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.260
 speed reset intelligence and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.500
 load 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 this is what the effects of the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.099
 position 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.200
 the more you put in let's put this this is 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.049
 to make poisons because they are cons and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.959
 damage this creates poisons restore d'or 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.260
 and charges are positions that you throw at 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.750
 yourself and yingjiang favor the people 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 that is not known what the hell is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.410
 aquatic breathing and against health this 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.320
 you can mix and what you do is 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.630
 puts a gun and when you hit it puts you 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.000
 aquatic breathing and fuck the health 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.060
 of the other or something of good soil we are going to 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.580
 do something simple, let's make a 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.200
 it detects life, you have seen that this 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.720
 has life detected once we put a 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.730
 object will put us possible positions 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.709
 because they can be created with the effects 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.360
 they have these you do not see restoration of 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.860
 resistance detects life restored 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.230
 of will and detects life as it 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.800
 will create a position is created detects life 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.590
 you see a potion detect life 52 and 180 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.920
 seconds is worth how much more things 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.440
 let's put better resistance this later 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.750
 we can go mixing not for example this 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.090
 He has photos and he has a will because 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.540
 we put will resistance or 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.540
 resistance 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.660
 we can put the two effects 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.360
 you have 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.100
 and you can call it detects life by the 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.750
 first name that has this goes for 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.819
 We can put the first name 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.599
 perfectly 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.599
 I know 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.550
 'us carchat creates a potion called 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.550
 frosty year today we can create several 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.979
 an example we were going to put now one 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.680
 random this 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.750
 this has lotus seeds have 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.020
 escartÃ­ resistance against health 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.740
 against health and against health we are going to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.639
 a poison for the health of the enemy is worth 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.330
 this what will do will be to take 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.310
 4 points this as it was against health I think 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.800
 which was that it reduced the other's life 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.770
 for 16 seconds your life goes down 4 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.810
 points for 16 seconds 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.810
 and me that we put on his name 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.580
 as if super original we put this 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.920
 name and it's already 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.180
 OK 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.940
 another example let's make a potion 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.680
 fuck more has left the game 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.170
 I do not know why I 'm really saying it because 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.760
 you do not notice it good and because oblivion is 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.770
 he snapped as more game entrepreneur 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.900
 well then 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.090
 I think it's clear what I mean 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.340
 if you have doubts leave it down I 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.330
 I will explain how to make potions of each 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.060
 type objects that you can use with objects 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.430
 ingredients 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.020
 there are lots of potions 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.680
 and they all serve to 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.470
 all serve for something specific the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.639
 best without doubts are the ones that cure 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.500
 poison and cure altered states or things 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.000
 A) Yes 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.540
 I hope that it has served you and until 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.540
 next video
