eating<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> form<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> fish<00:02:09.360> chicken<00:02:09.569> or

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
eating in the form of fish chicken or

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.070 
eating in the form of fish chicken or
beef<00:02:09.830> has<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> essential<00:02:12.300> amino<00:02:12.390> acids

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
beef has all the essential amino acids

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
beef has all the essential amino acids
all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.180 
all
because<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:15.450> already<00:02:15.690> muscle<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.070> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
because it's already muscle so if you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.610 
because it's already muscle so if you
eat<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.580> you're<00:02:18.270> golden<00:02:18.870> you're<00:02:19.260> good<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.590> go

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
eat that you're golden you're good to go

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.430 
eat that you're golden you're good to go
now<00:02:20.070> let's<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.150> about<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.660> if<00:02:21.960> we're

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
now let's think about this if we're

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.640 
now let's think about this if we're
talking<00:02:22.650> about<00:02:23.030> trying<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.270> eat<00:02:24.600> healthy<00:02:25.170> lose

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
talking about trying to eat healthy lose

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.890 
talking about trying to eat healthy lose
weight<00:02:25.950> build<00:02:26.400> muscle<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.090> make<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> world<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
weight build muscle and make the world a

weight build muscle and make the world a
better<00:02:27.930> place<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:29.340> want<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> think<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.850> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
better place we want to think of a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.520 
better place we want to think of a
well-balanced<00:02:30.890> low-fat<00:02:31.890> diet<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:34.080> we

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
well-balanced low-fat diet so if we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.520 
well-balanced low-fat diet so if we
begin<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.830> lower<00:02:35.550> our<00:02:35.880> fat<00:02:36.270> intake<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.230> means

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
begin to lower our fat intake that means

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.310 
begin to lower our fat intake that means
we<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.250> offset<00:02:38.790> those<00:02:39.300> calories<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.170> we

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
we have to offset those calories that we

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.040 
we have to offset those calories that we
lost<00:02:40.560> by<00:02:40.830> eating<00:02:41.220> fewer<00:02:41.490> fats<00:02:41.820> by<00:02:42.480> increasing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
lost by eating fewer fats by increasing

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.240 
lost by eating fewer fats by increasing
our<00:02:43.880> proteins<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.060> carbohydrates<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.250> if

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
our proteins and carbohydrates and if

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
our proteins and carbohydrates and if
you're<00:02:47.400> going<00:02:47.670> from<00:02:47.970> 1,800<00:02:48.600> calories<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:49.050> day

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170

to 2,200 calories a day because you're

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.060 
to 2,200 calories a day because you're
more<00:02:51.600> hungry<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.260> you're<00:02:52.470> working<00:02:52.920> out

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
more hungry because you're working out

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.760 
more hungry because you're working out
and<00:02:53.280> you're<00:02:53.640> training<00:02:53.910> harder<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.840> again

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
and you're training harder and again

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.470 
and you're training harder and again
you're<00:02:55.920> trying<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.310> lower<00:02:56.489> your<00:02:56.670> fat<00:02:56.910> intake

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
you're trying to lower your fat intake

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.600 
you're trying to lower your fat intake
you're<00:02:57.720> gonna<00:02:57.900> eat<00:02:57.989> additional<00:02:58.800> proteins<00:02:59.400> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you're gonna eat additional proteins and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.440 
you're gonna eat additional proteins and
carbohydrates<00:03:00.230> anyway<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:02.280> again<00:03:02.610> get<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
carbohydrates anyway to again get the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.780 
carbohydrates anyway to again get the
necessary<00:03:03.680> calories<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.310> additional

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
necessary calories and the additional

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.420 
necessary calories and the additional
nutrients<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.320> eat<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:07.980> additional

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
nutrients so just eat some additional

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.640 
nutrients so just eat some additional
food<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.850> don't<00:03:09.000> need<00:03:09.209> protein<00:03:09.750> shakes<00:03:10.050> save

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
food you don't need protein shakes save

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.420 
food you don't need protein shakes save
your<00:03:10.890> money

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
your money

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.660 
your money
there<00:03:11.760> ain't<00:03:11.880> no<00:03:12.060> magic<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.140> okay<00:03:14.100> if<00:03:14.430> you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
there ain't no magic to it okay if you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.570 
there ain't no magic to it okay if you
want<00:03:14.880> bigger<00:03:15.180> muscles<00:03:16.010> lift<00:03:17.010> bigger<00:03:17.280> weight

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
want bigger muscles lift bigger weight

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.340 
want bigger muscles lift bigger weight
lift<00:03:18.000> more<00:03:18.180> intensely<00:03:18.690> that's<00:03:18.989> why<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> always

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
lift more intensely that's why I always

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.220 
lift more intensely that's why I always
say<00:03:19.500> train<00:03:20.370> hard<00:03:20.610> train<00:03:20.970> smart<00:03:21.269> consistency

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
say train hard train smart consistency

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.610 
say train hard train smart consistency
intelligence<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:24.269> intensity<00:03:25.019> those<00:03:25.320> are<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
intelligence and intensity those are the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.020 
intelligence and intensity those are the
three<00:03:25.860> things<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.340> regards<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.850> training

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
three things with regards to training

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.380 
three things with regards to training
yes<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.660> need<00:03:27.840> protein<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.340> okay<00:03:30.030> just

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
yes we need protein I get it okay just

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.729 
yes we need protein I get it okay just
like<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.630> need<00:03:30.810> oxygen

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
like we need oxygen

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.220 
like we need oxygen
but<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.880> working<00:03:33.239> out<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.630> causes<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
but it's the working out that causes the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.080 
but it's the working out that causes the
body<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> utilize<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:34.950> protein<00:03:35.610> it's<00:03:35.820> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
body to utilize that protein it's the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.660 
body to utilize that protein it's the
carbohydrates<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.260> fuel<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.680> body<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:38.519> then

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
carbohydrates that fuel the body to then

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.270 
carbohydrates that fuel the body to then
utilize<00:03:39.209> those<00:03:39.570> proteins<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.100> most

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
utilize those proteins that's the most

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.150 
utilize those proteins that's the most
important<00:03:41.820> thing<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.290> personally<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.500> 50%

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
important thing I personally like 50%

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.690 
important thing I personally like 50%
complex<00:03:45.150> carbs<00:03:45.600> about<00:03:46.019> 30%<00:03:46.890> proteins<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
complex carbs about 30% proteins and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.930 
complex carbs about 30% proteins and
about<00:03:48.239> 20%<00:03:48.780> fat<00:03:49.380> obviously<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.579> lowered

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
about 20% fat obviously if you lowered

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.580 
about 20% fat obviously if you lowered
that<00:03:51.090> fat<00:03:51.540> percentage<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.680> 15<00:03:53.579> or<00:03:53.840> 10<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.410> then

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
that fat percentage to 15 or 10 you then

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.740 
that fat percentage to 15 or 10 you then
raise<00:03:55.980> your<00:03:56.090> carbohydrates<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.269> raise<00:03:57.540> your

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
raise your carbohydrates and raise your

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.319 
raise your carbohydrates and raise your
proteins<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:59.340> not<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.700> difficult

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
proteins it's not that difficult
