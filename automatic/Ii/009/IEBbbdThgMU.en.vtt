metal rescue fill the total metal rescue
plastic<00:01:45.790> metal<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:47.020> check<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:47.920> every<00:01:48.130> couple

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
plastic metal and check it every couple

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.370 
plastic metal and check it every couple
hours<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.970> as<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.480> see<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.750> rust<00:01:49.960> coming<00:01:50.230> off

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
hours and as you see the rust coming off

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.500 
hours and as you see the rust coming off
rotated<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.790> then<00:01:52.000> you'll<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.480> a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
rotated and then you'll have a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.280 
rotated and then you'll have a
completely<00:01:53.230> clean<00:01:53.500> rim<00:01:54.690> depending<00:01:55.690> on<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
completely clean rim depending on the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.230 
completely clean rim depending on the
time<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.620> takes<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:57.100> remove<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.640> rust<00:01:57.850> it's

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
time it takes to remove the rust it's

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.170 
time it takes to remove the rust it's
really<00:01:58.750> dependent<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.890> Ross<00:02:00.729> that's<00:02:01.030> on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
really dependent on the Ross that's on

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.390 
really dependent on the Ross that's on
your<00:02:01.390> metal<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:01.870> also<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.950> type<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.160> metal

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
your metal and also the type of metal

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.120 
your metal and also the type of metal
you<00:02:03.580> have<00:02:03.760> another<00:02:04.570> factor<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.350> plays<00:02:05.620> into

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
you have another factor that plays into

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.490 
you have another factor that plays into
the<00:02:06.550> whole<00:02:06.700> application<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.170> temperature

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the whole application is the temperature

doesn't do anything and it's so much

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.800 
doesn't do anything and it's so much
safer<00:02:33.430> than<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> acids<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.480> are<00:02:34.660> out<00:02:34.780> there

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
it out back in about six hours we

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.180 
it out back in about six hours we
checked<00:02:52.750> our<00:02:52.930> Wrentham<00:02:53.440> out<00:02:53.560> every<00:02:53.890> couple

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
checked our Wrentham out every couple

hours<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.850> as<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.720> see<00:02:56.550> metal<00:02:57.550> rescue

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
hours and as you can see metal rescue

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.420 
hours and as you can see metal rescue
took<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.540> rust<00:02:58.750> off<00:02:59.730> on<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.850> outside<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.530> on

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
took the rust off on the outside and on

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.869 
took the rust off on the outside and on
the<00:03:03.489> inside

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.630 

and<00:03:09.879> as<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.540> see<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.989> liquid<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:12.069> not

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
and as you can see the liquid is not

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.869 
and as you can see the liquid is not
black<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.050> not<00:03:14.230> spent<00:03:14.769> meaning<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.670> can

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
black so it's not spent meaning you can

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.820 
black so it's not spent meaning you can
put<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.269> back<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.690> your<00:03:16.720> bottle<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.290> use<00:03:17.650> it

put this back in your bottle and use it

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.600 
put this back in your bottle and use it
again<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:19.780> chisel<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.769> need<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.129> really

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
again now chisel you need to really

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.729 
again now chisel you need to really
remember<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.120> temperature<00:03:23.050> can<00:03:23.319> play<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
remember that temperature can play a

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.420 
remember that temperature can play a
part<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.340> how<00:03:25.299> quickly<00:03:25.569> it<00:03:26.110> de<00:03:26.230> rust<00:03:26.440> apart<00:03:26.830> if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
part in how quickly it de rust apart if

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.369 
part in how quickly it de rust apart if
it's<00:03:27.610> really<00:03:27.879> warm<00:03:28.150> outside<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.319> to

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
it's really warm outside it's going to

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's really warm outside it's going to
work<00:03:29.830> better<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.549> warmer<00:03:30.940> temperatures<00:03:31.239> if

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
work better in warmer temperatures if
