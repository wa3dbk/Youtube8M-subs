you're not used to riding these type of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
you're not used to riding these type of
boards<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.570> easily<00:02:36.020> fall<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.380> when<00:02:36.560> I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
boards you can easily fall like when I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.680 
boards you can easily fall like when I
first<00:02:36.860> started<00:02:37.130> writing<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.580> started<00:02:38.300> falling

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
first started writing I started falling

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.930 
first started writing I started falling
with<00:02:39.140> my<00:02:39.290> derringer<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.250> didn't<00:02:40.850> if

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
with my derringer because I didn't if

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.870 
with my derringer because I didn't if
you<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.150> know<00:02:41.480> how<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.780> ride<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.110> until<00:02:42.410> like

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
you like know how to ride it until like

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.060 
you like know how to ride it until like
like<00:02:43.880> 10<00:02:44.570> minutes<00:02:44.780> 15<00:02:45.290> years<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.590> practicing

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
like 10 minutes 15 years of practicing

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.670 
like 10 minutes 15 years of practicing
so<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.540> an<00:02:47.660> actually<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.110> great<00:02:48.290> board

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
so but it's an actually a great board

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.840 
so but it's an actually a great board
it's<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.520> great<00:02:49.730> car<00:02:49.970> over<00:02:50.240> good<00:02:51.200> cruiser<00:02:51.850> um

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's a great car over good cruiser um

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.690 
it's a great car over good cruiser um
you<00:02:53.720> can<00:02:53.870> get<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.560> six<00:02:54.800> trucks<00:02:55.100> will<00:02:55.670> work

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
you can get it that six trucks will work

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.520 
you can get it that six trucks will work
on<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.390> know<00:02:56.630> some<00:02:56.960> people<00:02:57.020> who<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
on it I know some people who have the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.920 
on it I know some people who have the
Essex<00:02:57.950> trucks<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:59.030> still<00:02:59.210> find<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.720> just

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
Essex trucks and it's still find it just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.410 
Essex trucks and it's still find it just
gives<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.230> sharper<00:03:00.590> turns<00:03:00.830> on<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:02.180> essay

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
gives you sharper turns on the essay

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.450 
gives you sharper turns on the essay
trucks<00:03:02.690> give<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.960> more<00:03:03.140> stability<00:03:03.920> though

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
trucks give you more stability though

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.000 
trucks give you more stability though
meaning<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.240> can<00:03:05.390> go<00:03:05.540> faster<00:03:06.050> bomb<00:03:06.320> hills<00:03:06.620> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
meaning you can go faster bomb hills and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.690 
meaning you can go faster bomb hills and
as<00:03:07.730> tenis<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.500> wouldn't<00:03:09.500> recommend<00:03:10.130> us<00:03:10.430> tens

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
as tenis I wouldn't recommend us tens

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.800 
as tenis I wouldn't recommend us tens
for<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.000> um<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.770> just<00:03:13.240> I'm<00:03:14.240> saying<00:03:14.630> that

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
for this um I just I'm saying that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.530 
for this um I just I'm saying that
because<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.520> think<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.090> essays<00:03:17.390> are

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
because the I think the essays are

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.360 
because the I think the essays are
perfect<00:03:17.930> size<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.590> end<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:18.800> think<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.250> s

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
perfect size and the end I think the s

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.430 
perfect size and the end I think the s
times<00:03:19.640> would<00:03:19.760> be<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.060> bait<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.930> board<00:03:21.230> I

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
times would be to bait this board I

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.990 
times would be to bait this board I
don't<00:03:22.370> know<00:03:22.460> it's<00:03:22.700> really<00:03:23.030> up<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:23.900> ah

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
don't know it's really up to you so ah

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.650 
don't know it's really up to you so ah
yeah<00:03:26.000> that's<00:03:26.870> basically<00:03:27.170> my<00:03:27.500> review<00:03:28.070> uh

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
yeah that's basically my review uh

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.120 
yeah that's basically my review uh
sometimes<00:03:29.660> also<00:03:30.140> you're<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.770> want<00:03:30.830> to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
sometimes also you're going to want to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.000 
sometimes also you're going to want to
uh<00:03:32.290> sometimes<00:03:33.290> you're<00:03:33.500> going<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.770> want<00:03:33.920> to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
uh sometimes you're going to want to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.400 
uh sometimes you're going to want to
maybe<00:03:34.280> loosen<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.880> trucks<00:03:35.240> or<00:03:35.660> tighten<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
maybe loosen the trucks or tighten the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.230 
maybe loosen the trucks or tighten the
trucks<00:03:36.740> because<00:03:37.220> sometimes<00:03:37.730> they<00:03:38.060> come

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
trucks because sometimes they come

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.420 
trucks because sometimes they come

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
tightened or loosened and you are

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.890 
tightened or loosened and you are
sometimes<00:03:40.790> clean<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.360> trucks<00:03:41.630> that's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
sometimes clean the trucks that's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.960 
sometimes clean the trucks that's
actually<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.500> good<00:03:43.010> thing<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.370> do<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.730> clean

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.470 
actually a good thing to do and clean
their<00:03:44.150> bearings<00:03:44.510> um<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:46.580> unless<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.240> got<00:03:47.330> the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
their bearings um so unless I got the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.780 
their bearings um so unless I got the
selfless<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.310> don't<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.520> they're<00:03:49.700> in

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
selfless I don't know if they're in

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.110 
selfless I don't know if they're in
stock<00:03:49.820> for<00:03:50.270> any<00:03:50.420> board<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:50.840> but<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:52.670> got<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
stock for any board now but I I got the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.870 
stock for any board now but I I got the
sauce<00:03:53.300> with<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.830> wheel<00:03:55.100> goes<00:03:55.130> for<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.670> while

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
sauce with so the wheel goes for a while

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.410 
sauce with so the wheel goes for a while
actually<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:57.550> so<00:03:58.550> sometimes<00:03:58.880> you're<00:03:59.270> gonna

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
actually and so sometimes you're gonna

have to clean your bearings clean the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
have to clean your bearings clean the
inside<00:04:02.270> of<00:04:02.300> your<00:04:02.570> trucks<00:04:02.930> stuff<00:04:03.680> like<00:04:03.830> that
