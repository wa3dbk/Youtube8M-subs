that<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:30.779> off<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.410> vsync<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.920> off<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that one or off like vsync is off so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.610 
that one or off like vsync is off so
it's<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.180> pretty<00:00:33.390> low<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> i'm<00:00:34.290> getting<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's all pretty low and i'm getting a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.920 
it's all pretty low and i'm getting a
frame<00:00:34.860> rate<00:00:35.040> between<00:00:35.390> six<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.770> twenty<00:00:37.770> five

sometimes<00:00:39.930> even<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> 30<00:00:40.590> averaging

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
sometimes even up to 30 averaging

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
sometimes even up to 30 averaging
probably<00:00:41.730> somewhere<00:00:42.480> between<00:00:42.829> 12<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> 15<00:00:44.129> I'd

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
probably somewhere between 12 and 15 I'd

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.410 
probably somewhere between 12 and 15 I'd
say<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.170> getting<00:00:46.289> 17<00:00:47.210> time<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
say right now I'm getting 17 time to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.490 
say right now I'm getting 17 time to
enter<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.910> right<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.260> vehicle

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
enter and right now this is the vehicle

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
now I'm getting the frame rate is not

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.010 
now I'm getting the frame rate is not
the<00:01:26.950> right<00:01:27.070> i'm<00:01:27.250> getting<00:01:27.490> about<00:01:27.579> 13<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.390> 15<00:01:28.570> as

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
can't believe I'm actually getting

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.010 
can't believe I'm actually getting
decent<00:01:57.380> framerate<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.400> thing

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
decent framerate on this thing

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.090 
decent framerate on this thing
ridiculous<00:02:00.020> i'm<00:02:00.140> getting<00:02:00.350> almost<00:02:00.470> up<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.770> 20

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
ridiculous i'm getting almost up to 20

ridiculous i'm getting almost up to 20
right<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:01.430> i'm<00:02:01.550> getting<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> 14

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.570 

long<00:02:07.360> scar

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580 

I'm<00:02:16.180> struggling<00:02:16.540> i'm<00:02:16.780> getting<00:02:17.020> only<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.290> 10

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
I'm struggling i'm getting only a 10

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.370 
I'm struggling i'm getting only a 10
sometimes<00:02:18.400> into<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.700> 9<00:02:21.810> i'm<00:02:22.810> pretty<00:02:23.230> sure<00:02:23.350> that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
sometimes into a 9 i'm pretty sure that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.310 
sometimes into a 9 i'm pretty sure that
the<00:02:23.560> cpu<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.160> maxed<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.270> min

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.280 

hmm<00:02:29.320> I'll<00:02:30.070> see<00:02:30.370> much<00:02:30.520> like<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.880> foot<00:02:31.210> on<00:02:31.960> foot

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
hmm I'll see much like on foot on foot

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.820 
hmm I'll see much like on foot on foot
is<00:02:32.410> about<00:02:32.830> similar<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.460> frame<00:02:33.730> rate

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.580 

he's<00:02:42.640> going<00:02:43.120> bragging

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.140 

just<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.370> over<00:02:47.400> about<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> minute

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
just going to go over about a minute

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.220 
just going to go over about a minute
more<00:02:48.860> see<00:02:49.860> what's<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.900> let<00:02:55.140> me<00:02:55.170> show

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
more see what's like so now let me show

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.190 
more see what's like so now let me show
you<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> textures

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.630 

nothing<00:02:59.830> fantastic

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
nothing fantastic

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.000 
nothing fantastic
so<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.660> thought<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.990> kind<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.319> got<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.770> stuck

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so I thought that I kind of got it stuck

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.490 
so I thought that I kind of got it stuck
there<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.400> second<00:03:04.730> i<00:03:04.760> was<00:03:04.850> getting<00:03:05.030> shot<00:03:05.240> at

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
there for a second i was getting shot at

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.690 
there for a second i was getting shot at
should<00:03:06.500> probably<00:03:06.680> pay<00:03:07.100> more<00:03:07.130> attention<00:03:07.670> to

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
should probably pay more attention to

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.090 
should probably pay more attention to
the<00:03:07.819> game<00:03:11.050> over<00:03:12.050> here<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:14.920> should<00:03:15.920> probably

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
the game over here I should probably

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.040 
the game over here I should probably
move<00:03:16.580> back<00:03:16.850> then

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.700 

oh<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.620> should<00:03:20.920> probably<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.280> TFT<00:03:21.790> person<00:03:22.710> that

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
oh I should probably a TFT person that

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.180

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
may be a good idea I guess I'm just

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.590 
may be a good idea I guess I'm just
going<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.490> for<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> few<00:03:30.970> more<00:03:31.150> seconds<00:03:31.510> it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
going to go for a few more seconds it

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.500 
going to go for a few more seconds it
