hello<00:00:08.120> fellas<00:00:08.630> and<00:00:08.900> welcome<00:00:09.680> to<00:00:10.040> part<00:00:10.580> eight<00:00:11.540> I

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
hello fellas and welcome to part eight I

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.549 
hello fellas and welcome to part eight I
think<00:00:13.219> I<00:00:13.490> can't<00:00:13.790> really<00:00:13.910> remember

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
think I can't really remember

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.150 
think I can't really remember
of<00:00:15.559> our<00:00:16.570> what<00:00:17.570> is<00:00:17.689> it<00:00:17.840> called<00:00:18.050> platform<00:00:19.040> of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
of our what is it called platform of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.570 
of our what is it called platform of
tutorial<00:00:19.670> series<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:21.770> one<00:00:22.130> we<00:00:22.550> are

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
tutorial series and this one we are

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.960 
tutorial series and this one we are
going<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.300> do<00:00:23.480> bounce<00:00:24.040> for<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.340> camera

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
going to do bounce for the camera

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.049 
going to do bounce for the camera
movement<00:00:27.099> so<00:00:28.099> let's<00:00:28.820> just<00:00:29.270> jump<00:00:29.450> right<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:30.050> and

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
movement so let's just jump right in and

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.920 
movement so let's just jump right in and
now<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:32.119> are<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.660> script<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:35.360> what<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.840> are

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
now we are in the script so what we are

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.380 
now we are in the script so what we are
going<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.410> do<00:00:36.670> is<00:00:38.680> limiting<00:00:39.680> where<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.910> camera

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
going to do is limiting where the camera

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.140 
going to do is limiting where the camera
can<00:00:41.420> go<00:00:41.800> for<00:00:42.800> example<00:00:42.950> by<00:00:43.910> limiting<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.890> maybe

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
can go for example by limiting the maybe

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.750 
can go for example by limiting the maybe
so<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.420> camera<00:00:47.960> can't<00:00:48.290> go<00:00:48.650> down<00:00:49.630> under<00:00:50.630> this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
so the camera can't go down under this

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.610 
so the camera can't go down under this
platform<00:00:52.760> for<00:00:52.940> example<00:00:53.079> so<00:00:54.079> we<00:00:54.410> are<00:00:54.500> just

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
platform for example so we are just

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
platform for example so we are just
going<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.980> do<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.370> for<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.790> tutorial<00:00:56.050> and

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
going to do that for this tutorial and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.319 
going to do that for this tutorial and
the<00:00:58.640> way<00:00:58.820> we're<00:00:59.030> going<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.360> do<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.810> is<00:00:59.989> by<00:01:01.329> this

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
the way we're going to do it is by this

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.340 
the way we're going to do it is by this
so<00:01:03.670> first<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.939> all<00:01:05.149> we<00:01:05.299> need<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.630> create<00:01:06.079> some

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
so first of all we need to create some

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.230 
so first of all we need to create some
new<00:01:06.590> new<00:01:07.399> our<00:01:08.200> variables

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
new new our variables

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.710 
new new our variables
first<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.600> are<00:01:11.630> going<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.260> boom<00:01:12.860> called

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
first we are going to boom called

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.680 
first we are going to boom called
and<00:01:15.220> bounce<00:01:16.540> just<00:01:17.540> if<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.590> check/uncheck<00:01:19.690> if

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
and bounce just if to check/uncheck if

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.530 
and bounce just if to check/uncheck if
you<00:01:20.810> want<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.850> make<00:01:22.850> boundaries<00:01:23.330> for<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
you want to make boundaries for the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.600 
you want to make boundaries for the
camera<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.260> then<00:01:24.799> we're<00:01:24.979> going<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.280> create

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
camera and then we're going to create

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:45.510 
camera and then we're going to create
two<00:01:25.700> more<00:01:26.180> called<00:01:38.440> maximum

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.510 

so<00:01:46.810> let's<00:01:47.810> go<00:01:47.990> down<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.439> fixed<00:01:48.829> update<00:01:48.979> again

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
so let's go down to a fixed update again

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.179 
so let's go down to a fixed update again
and<00:01:50.560> then<00:01:51.560> check<00:01:52.009> if<00:01:52.340> we<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:53.649> enabled<00:01:54.649> pounce

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
and then check if we have enabled pounce

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:55.719 
and then check if we have enabled pounce
on<00:01:55.340> us

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
on us

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.910 
on us
so<00:01:56.090> if<00:01:56.329> we<00:01:56.539> have<00:01:56.630> found<00:01:57.250> let's<00:01:59.229> let's<00:02:00.229> make

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
so if we have found let's let's make

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.440 
so if we have found let's let's make
boundaries<00:02:01.369> for<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.610> camera<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.710> um<00:02:04.299> let's<00:02:05.299> do

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
boundaries for the camera so um let's do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.969 
boundaries for the camera so um let's do
this<00:02:05.689> um<00:02:05.960> try<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.340> set<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.670> transform<00:02:08.269> dot

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
this um try this set the transform dot

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.020 
this um try this set the transform dot
position<00:02:10.900> equals<00:02:11.900> two<00:02:12.370> new<00:02:13.480> vector3<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:16.340> we're

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
position equals two new vector3 so we're

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.900 
position equals two new vector3 so we're
going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.299> say<00:02:17.569> math<00:02:17.959> if<00:02:18.580> top<00:02:19.580> clamp<00:02:21.910> clamp

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
going to say math if top clamp clamp

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.720 
going to say math if top clamp clamp
that<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.959> doesn't<00:02:24.290> exceed<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.810> value<00:02:27.730> so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that so it doesn't exceed a value so

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.650 
that so it doesn't exceed a value so
let's<00:02:29.120> set<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:30.250> transform<00:02:31.299> wait<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.329> minute

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
let's set the transform wait a minute

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.000 
let's set the transform wait a minute
yeah<00:02:34.090> transform<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.720> position<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:37.400> X

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
yeah transform that position that X

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.030 
yeah transform that position that X
minimum<00:02:40.010> camera<00:02:40.610> position<00:02:41.209> X<00:02:42.079> and<00:02:44.769> then<00:02:45.769> we

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
minimum camera position X and then we

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.150 
minimum camera position X and then we
are<00:02:46.220> going<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.670> say<00:02:49.030> max<00:02:50.030> camera<00:02:50.630> position<00:02:51.350> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
are going to say max camera position to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.910 
are going to say max camera position to
max<00:02:52.340> character<00:02:52.790> position<00:02:53.239> buttocks<00:02:53.780> um<00:02:54.079> then

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
max character position buttocks um then

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.099 
max character position buttocks um then
we're<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.370> say<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:56.690> out<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
we're going to say get out of the

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.210 
we're going to say get out of the
brackets<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.930> make<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> new<00:03:00.200> comer<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.739> go

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
brackets and make a new comer and go

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520 
brackets and make a new comer and go
down<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.489> line<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:02.090> here<00:03:03.079> we're<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
down the line and here we're going to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.550 
down the line and here we're going to
say<00:03:03.769> map<00:03:04.220> F<00:03:04.840> clamp<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.139> this<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.769> what<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.040> y

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
say map F clamp and this is what the y

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.039 
say map F clamp and this is what the y
transform<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.230> top<00:03:12.530> position<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> wine

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
transform is on top position the wine

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.050 
transform is on top position the wine
and<00:03:15.049> we're<00:03:15.440> going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.829> clamp<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.489> minim

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and we're going to clamp it to minim

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.410 
and we're going to clamp it to minim
camera<00:03:18.519> position<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.750> doctored<00:03:20.750> wine<00:03:21.019> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
camera position and doctored wine and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.059 
camera position and doctored wine and
maximum<00:03:23.680> camera<00:03:24.680> position<00:03:25.280> Y<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.769> then<00:03:27.920> we're

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
maximum camera position Y and then we're

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.150 
maximum camera position Y and then we're
gonna<00:03:28.250> sitcom<00:03:28.849> again<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.750> go<00:03:30.319> down<00:03:30.349> line<00:03:30.829> and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
gonna sitcom again and go down line and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.509 
gonna sitcom again and go down line and
say<00:03:31.459> math<00:03:34.569> transform<00:03:35.569> position<00:03:36.170> dot<00:03:36.950> C

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.289 

minimum<00:03:40.519> camera<00:03:40.970> position<00:03:41.419> does<00:03:41.599> C<00:03:41.840> and

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
minimum camera position does C and

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.670 
minimum camera position does C and
maximum<00:03:44.299> camera<00:03:44.989> position

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:56.680 

so<00:03:48.680> yeah<00:03:51.970> when<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.120> go<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.570> here<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.330> see

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
so yeah when we go in here we can see

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.930 
so yeah when we go in here we can see
that<00:03:56.720> we<00:03:57.230> got<00:03:57.410> two<00:03:57.860> new<00:03:58.540> variables<00:03:59.540> and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
that we got two new variables and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.240 
that we got two new variables and
actually<00:04:01.940> three<00:04:02.320> bounds<00:04:03.320> film<00:04:03.650> camera<00:04:04.040> pose

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
actually three bounds film camera pose

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.060 
actually three bounds film camera pose
and<00:04:04.490> maximum<00:04:05.000> camera<00:04:05.390> pose<00:04:05.710> pose<00:04:06.710> position<00:04:09.070> so

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
and maximum camera pose pose position so

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.880 
and maximum camera pose pose position so
we<00:04:10.340> are<00:04:10.430> going<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.790> enable<00:04:11.240> bounce<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.680> we're

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
we are going to enable bounce so we're

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.229 
we are going to enable bounce so we're
going<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.190> set<00:04:16.460> the<00:04:16.610> minimum<00:04:16.940> camera<00:04:17.870> position

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
going to set the minimum camera position

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.570 
going to set the minimum camera position
which<00:04:20.239> we're<00:04:20.570> going<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:21.020> set<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.290> this<00:04:22.280> right

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
which we're going to set to this right

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.480 
which we're going to set to this right
here<00:04:22.820> or<00:04:22.970> we<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.380> find<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.680> minimum<00:04:25.070> counter

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
here or we can find the minimum counter

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.860 
here or we can find the minimum counter
position<00:04:25.640> by<00:04:26.830> placing<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.250> camera<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.390> then

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
position by placing the camera and then

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.700 
position by placing the camera and then
see<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.920> works<00:04:31.220> for<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.960> set<00:04:33.560> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
see if it works for you and then set the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.600 
see if it works for you and then set the
minimum<00:04:33.980> camera<00:04:34.370> position<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:40.010> one

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
minimum camera position to this so one

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
minimum camera position to this so one
one<00:04:41.240> point<00:04:41.510> four<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:43.750> two<00:04:44.750> point<00:04:45.020> nine<00:04:45.230> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
one point four and two point nine and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.200 
one point four and two point nine and
minus<00:04:47.630> ten<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:48.860> actually<00:04:49.220> also<00:04:49.370> be<00:04:49.610> minus<00:04:50.060> in

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
minus ten can actually also be minus in

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.180 
minus ten can actually also be minus in
here<00:04:50.450> because<00:04:50.750> we<00:04:50.870> won't<00:04:51.080> change<00:04:51.440> DC<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:54.710> what

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
here because we won't change DC so what

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.410 
here because we won't change DC so what
we<00:04:55.460> are<00:04:55.670> doing<00:04:55.700> here<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.950> we've<00:04:57.950> set<00:04:58.220> the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
we are doing here is we've set the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.500 
we are doing here is we've set the
minimum<00:04:59.420> x<00:05:00.260> position<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:01.190> one<00:05:01.640> point<00:05:01.940> four<00:05:02.240> and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
minimum x position to one point four and

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.070 
minimum x position to one point four and
I<00:05:03.350> guess<00:05:03.590> we<00:05:04.160> won't<00:05:04.580> do<00:05:04.910> that<00:05:05.150> because<00:05:05.480> then<00:05:05.930> we

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
I guess we won't do that because then we

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.150 
I guess we won't do that because then we
can<00:05:06.350> move<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.860> left<00:05:07.450> which<00:05:08.450> would<00:05:08.750> be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
can move to the left which would be

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.720 
can move to the left which would be
pretty<00:05:10.160> annoying

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
pretty annoying

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.110 
pretty annoying
I<00:05:10.760> guess<00:05:11.980> so<00:05:12.980> let's<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.580> put<00:05:13.850> that<00:05:13.910> to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
I guess so let's just put that to

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120 
I guess so let's just put that to
another<00:05:17.120> number<00:05:17.390> like<00:05:17.720> -<00:05:18.170> hundred<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:18.800> we<00:05:18.950> can

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
another number like - hundred so we can

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.570 
another number like - hundred so we can
go<00:05:19.420> go<00:05:20.420> away<00:05:20.510> way<00:05:21.320> over<00:05:21.590> here<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:23.360> then<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:25.280> the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
go go away way over here and then so the

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.180 
go go away way over here and then so the
minimum<00:05:26.030> Y<00:05:26.150> position<00:05:26.420> is<00:05:26.870> here<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:27.560> we<00:05:27.590> are<00:05:27.740> not

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
minimum Y position is here so we are not

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.080 
minimum Y position is here so we are not
going<00:05:28.730> to<00:05:28.910> get<00:05:29.120> below<00:05:29.720> this<00:05:30.290> point<00:05:30.650> here<00:05:31.090> which

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
going to get below this point here which

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.850 
going to get below this point here which
is<00:05:32.120> nice<00:05:32.420> and<00:05:34.690> here<00:05:35.690> we<00:05:35.870> are<00:05:35.900> going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.410> set<00:05:36.710> the

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
is nice and here we are going to set the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.600 
is nice and here we are going to set the
max<00:05:37.190> position<00:05:37.970> for<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.660> X<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.170> we<00:05:40.070> also<00:05:40.220> want

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
max position for the X and we also want

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.760 
max position for the X and we also want
to<00:05:40.700> go<00:05:41.030> like<00:05:41.740> far<00:05:42.740> away<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.790> x<00:05:43.940> axis<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.770> we

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
to go like far away and the x axis so we

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.580 
to go like far away and the x axis so we
are<00:05:46.280> going<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.730> set<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:48.880> mm<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.170> doesn't

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
are going to set that mm so it doesn't

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.760 
are going to set that mm so it doesn't
actually<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:53.270> have<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.570> go<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.750> long<00:05:54.050> way<00:05:54.290> for

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
actually you have to go a long way for

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.520 
actually you have to go a long way for
it<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:54.950> clamp<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.910> X<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:58.070> for<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.520> Y<00:05:58.700> also

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
it to clamp the X and for the Y also

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.390 
it to clamp the X and for the Y also
mm<00:06:01.530> because<00:06:03.170> we<00:06:04.170> don't<00:06:04.710> have<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:05.070> do<00:06:05.220> that

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
mm because we don't have to do that

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.840 
mm because we don't have to do that
right<00:06:05.670> now

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
right now

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.880 
right now
you<00:06:06.330> can<00:06:06.510> do<00:06:06.630> it<00:06:06.660> if<00:06:06.870> you<00:06:07.020> have<00:06:07.230> another<00:06:07.560> level

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
you can do it if you have another level

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:16.520 
you can do it if you have another level
so<00:06:09.200> let's<00:06:10.280> see<00:06:11.280> if<00:06:11.460> this<00:06:11.730> works<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:15.290> it<00:06:16.290> does

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
so let's see if this works and it does

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.090 
so let's see if this works and it does
as<00:06:16.800> you<00:06:16.980> can<00:06:17.100> see<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:18.750> player<00:06:19.110> is<00:06:19.410> under<00:06:19.770> the

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
as you can see the player is under the

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.720 
as you can see the player is under the
camera<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:21.390> camera<00:06:21.720> should<00:06:21.870> actually<00:06:22.050> be

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
camera and the camera should actually be

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.240 
camera and the camera should actually be
attached<00:06:23.730> or<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.930> right<00:06:25.470> at<00:06:25.650> the<00:06:25.800> center<00:06:26.220> of

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
attached or the right at the center of

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.970 
attached or the right at the center of
the<00:06:26.400> player<00:06:26.640> but<00:06:27.600> we<00:06:27.960> have<00:06:28.200> created

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
the player but we have created

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.660 
the player but we have created
boundaries<00:06:29.580> so<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:30.360> doesn't<00:06:30.750> can<00:06:31.250> but<00:06:32.250> it<00:06:32.370> so

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
boundaries so it doesn't can but it so

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.210 
boundaries so it doesn't can but it so
thus<00:06:33.680> what<00:06:34.680> am<00:06:34.770> I<00:06:34.830> saying

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
thus what am I saying

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.290 
thus what am I saying
so<00:06:35.760> I<00:06:35.790> cannot<00:06:36.240> go<00:06:37.190> under<00:06:38.190> these<00:06:38.460> values<00:06:41.300> so

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
so I cannot go under these values so

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.520 
so I cannot go under these values so
yeah<00:06:43.040> it<00:06:44.040> looks<00:06:44.250> good<00:06:44.930> we<00:06:45.930> have<00:06:46.080> double

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
yeah it looks good we have double

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.420 
yeah it looks good we have double
jumping<00:06:46.950> and<00:06:47.750> it's<00:06:48.750> nice<00:06:50.930> so<00:06:52.040> for<00:06:53.040> the<00:06:53.130> next

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
jumping and it's nice so for the next
