was God and that word became flesh and

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.660 
was God and that word became flesh and
dwelt<00:02:09.450> among<00:02:09.840> us<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.769> we<00:02:11.099> say<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
dwelt among us right if we say that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.860 
dwelt among us right if we say that
Jesus<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.870> Word<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.440> God<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.750> we

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
Jesus the Word is God then are we

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.280 
Jesus the Word is God then are we
suddenly<00:02:16.110> worshipping<00:02:16.890> more<00:02:17.190> than<00:02:17.459> one<00:02:17.730> God

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
suddenly worshipping more than one God

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.720 
suddenly worshipping more than one God
took<00:02:19.290> Christians<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.799> long<00:02:20.040> time<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.489> settle

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
took Christians a long time to settle

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.699 
took Christians a long time to settle
that<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.359> of<00:02:21.540> those<00:02:21.719> discussions<00:02:22.200> came

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that and out of those discussions came

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.970 
that and out of those discussions came
to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.619 
to
then<00:02:23.099> we<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.400> call<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.819> doctrine<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
then we now call the doctrine of the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.899 
then we now call the doctrine of the

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
Trinity now we're not in this course

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.670 
Trinity now we're not in this course
going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.239> spend<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.629> lot<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.870> time<00:02:28.049> with<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.380 
going to spend a lot of time with the
Trinity<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:29.610> what's<00:02:29.790> important<00:02:30.299> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
Trinity but what's important to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.030 
Trinity but what's important to
recognize<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.560> Christians

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
recognize is that what Christians

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.180 
recognize is that what Christians
decided<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.180> fact<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.720> Biblical

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
decided was that in fact the Biblical

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.420 
decided was that in fact the Biblical
witness<00:02:35.190> testifies<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> single<00:02:37.319> God<00:02:37.560> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
witness testifies to a single God that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.150 
witness testifies to a single God that
we<00:02:38.610> experience<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.870> made<00:02:40.110> manifest<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.920> us

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
we experience or is made manifest to us

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.089 
we experience or is made manifest to us
in<00:02:41.400> three<00:02:42.150> distinct<00:02:42.810> persons<00:02:43.349> Father<00:02:43.650> Son<00:02:44.069> and

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
in three distinct persons Father Son and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.550 
in three distinct persons Father Son and
Holy<00:02:44.250> Spirit<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.900> reason<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.440> was

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
Holy Spirit and the reason it was

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.400 
Holy Spirit and the reason it was
important<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.099> confess<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.910> Jesus<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.629> part

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
important to confess that Jesus as part

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.369 
important to confess that Jesus as part
of<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> Trinity<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.160> fully<00:02:50.790> God<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
of the Trinity is fully God is so that

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.800 
of the Trinity is fully God is so that
we<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> trust<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.250> promises<00:02:53.940> God<00:02:54.180> makes<00:02:54.569> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
we can trust the promises God makes to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.460 
we can trust the promises God makes to
us<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.650> through<00:02:55.920> Jesus<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:57.720> some<00:02:58.170> early

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
us in and through Jesus if some early

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.490 
us in and through Jesus if some early
church<00:02:58.709> leaders<00:02:59.069> said<00:02:59.579> if<00:02:59.870> Jesus<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.019> only<00:03:01.260> an

church leaders said if Jesus is only an

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
super mortal that means that there was a

super mortal that means that there was a
time<00:03:07.950> before<00:03:07.980> Jesus<00:03:08.940> began<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.629> they'll<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.349> a

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
time before Jesus began and they'll be a

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.699 
time before Jesus began and they'll be a
time<00:03:10.709> after<00:03:11.340> Jesus<00:03:11.790> comes<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.359> an<00:03:12.450> end<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.840> if

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
time after Jesus comes to an end and if

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.920 
time after Jesus comes to an end and if
that's<00:03:13.950> true<00:03:14.370> if<00:03:14.670> Jesus<00:03:15.359> is<00:03:15.480> part<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
that's true if Jesus is part of the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.660 
that's true if Jesus is part of the
created<00:03:16.410> world<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.980> eventually<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.519> be

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
created world that eventually will be

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.990 
created world that eventually will be
uncreated<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:19.739> trust<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.370> promises

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
uncreated then can we trust the promises

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.059 
uncreated then can we trust the promises
that<00:03:21.239> God<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.140> making<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> us<00:03:22.739> through<00:03:23.040> Jesus

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
that God is making to us through Jesus

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.150 
that God is making to us through Jesus
so<00:03:23.670> church<00:03:23.940> leaders<00:03:24.299> like<00:03:24.569> athanasius<00:03:25.379> but<00:03:26.040> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so church leaders like athanasius but it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.550 
so church leaders like athanasius but it
was<00:03:26.250> vitally<00:03:26.790> important<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.540> confess<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.349> in

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
was vitally important to confess that in

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.539 
was vitally important to confess that in
Jesus<00:03:29.340> we<00:03:29.519> receive<00:03:30.000> God<00:03:30.560> really<00:03:31.560> God<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.430> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
Jesus we receive God really God so that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.089 
Jesus we receive God really God so that
we<00:03:32.639> can<00:03:32.790> trust<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.750> promises<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.470> God<00:03:34.859> makes

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
we can trust the promises that God makes

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.420 
we can trust the promises that God makes
us<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.730> us<00:03:35.940> through<00:03:36.209> Jesus<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.919> second

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
us to us through Jesus the second

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.729 
us to us through Jesus the second
concern<00:03:38.849> was<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> more<00:03:39.569> basic<00:03:39.810> or<00:03:40.200> human<00:03:40.560> one

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
concern was a more basic or human one

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.009 
concern was a more basic or human one
that<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.230> doesn't<00:03:43.650> seem<00:03:43.950> God<00:03:44.849> like<00:03:45.269> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
that is it just doesn't seem God like to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.830 
that is it just doesn't seem God like to
talk<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.410> God<00:03:46.769> becoming<00:03:47.220> human<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.849> you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
talk about God becoming human if you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360 
talk about God becoming human if you
think<00:03:49.109> particularly<00:03:49.680> about<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.190> other

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
think particularly about the other

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.220 
think particularly about the other
notions<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.060> God<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.569> we're<00:03:51.720> floating

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
notions of God that we're floating

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.599 
notions of God that we're floating
around<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.889> world<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.340> time

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
around the world of this time

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.210 
around the world of this time
particularly<00:03:54.090> greco-roman<00:03:54.690> notions<00:03:55.560> think

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
particularly greco-roman notions think

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.409 
particularly greco-roman notions think
about<00:03:56.400> what<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.730> remember<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.150> Greek

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
about what you remember of Greek

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.349 
about what you remember of Greek
philosophy<00:03:57.569> God<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.560> unmoved<00:03:59.160> mover<00:03:59.910> God

philosophy God is the unmoved mover God

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.589 
philosophy God is the unmoved mover God
is<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.780> first<00:04:01.139> cause<00:04:01.590> God<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.639> behind<00:04:03.120> all

is the first cause God is behind all
things<00:04:04.190> then<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.370> hard<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.849> imagine<00:04:06.120> or

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
things then it's hard to imagine or

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.930 
things then it's hard to imagine or
square<00:04:06.989> those<00:04:07.260> ideas<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:08.040> God<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.579> sort<00:04:08.849> of
