projection over here

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.330 
projection over here
fancy<00:00:57.750> ERL<00:00:58.200> looking<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:58.740> not<00:00:58.860> like<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.220> be

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
fancy ERL looking and not like to be

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.530 
fancy ERL looking and not like to be
6,000<00:00:59.880> case<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.200> a<00:01:01.440> turn<00:01:02.250> signal

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
6,000 case then we got a turn signal

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.609 
6,000 case then we got a turn signal
vesicle<00:01:03.540> for<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.720> cutoff

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
vesicle for the cutoff

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.530 
vesicle for the cutoff
look<00:01:06.130> at<00:01:06.250> that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
extremely strong scatter of light

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.520 
extremely strong scatter of light
everywhere<00:01:26.280> that's<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.790> flare<00:01:27.120> everyone

so<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.310> no<00:01:42.580> turn<00:01:42.820> signals<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.270> here<00:01:43.480> this

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
so there is no turn signals in here this

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.510 
so there is no turn signals in here this
is<00:01:43.840> straight<00:01:44.110> up<00:01:44.140> headlights<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.820> find<00:01:46.120> me

more time

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.350 
more time
