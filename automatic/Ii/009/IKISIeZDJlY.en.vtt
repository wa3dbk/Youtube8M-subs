00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
when you make a job you better use sour

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.109

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
one you know this one called cold yogurt

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.279 
one you know this one called cold yogurt
and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.259> favorite<00:01:15.140> but<00:01:16.140> the

and this is my favorite but the

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.850 
and this is my favorite but the
seasoning<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.220> short<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.619> sometimes<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
seasoning is really short so sometimes I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:32.330 
seasoning is really short so sometimes I
missed<00:01:20.220> goodbye<00:01:25.640> I'm<00:01:26.640> succeeding<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:32.130> my

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
missed goodbye I'm succeeding it's my

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:45.469 
missed goodbye I'm succeeding it's my
first<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.330> make

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 

because<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.430> Apple<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
because I really like this Apple so I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.440 
because I really like this Apple so I
always<00:01:49.170> eat<00:01:49.860> by<00:01:50.610> itself<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.990> by<00:01:55.259> manager

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
always eat by itself but this by manager

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.969 
always eat by itself but this by manager
yeah<00:01:57.740> anyway<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.799> changed<00:01:59.340> my<00:01:59.490> glasses

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
yeah anyway I changed my glasses

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:14.570 
yeah anyway I changed my glasses
so<00:02:01.979> then<00:02:02.250> cut<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> Apple<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.689> pieces<00:02:13.580> so

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so then cut the Apple in the pieces so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.509 
so then cut the Apple in the pieces so
this<00:02:14.760> Apple<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.450> small<00:02:16.099> compared<00:02:17.099> with<00:02:17.250> other

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
this Apple is small compared with other

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.759 
this Apple is small compared with other
Apple<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.269> Japan<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.560> bigger<00:02:22.560> than

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
Apple in Japan but so it's bigger than

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:36.410 
Apple in Japan but so it's bigger than
you<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:34.190> European<00:02:35.190> any<00:02:35.430> chain<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.150> cut<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you and European any chain is cut like

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.520 
you and European any chain is cut like
this

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.920 

I<00:02:44.600> like<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.870> way<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:46.950> good<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.910> but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.850 

simple<00:02:53.660> right<00:02:54.660> refer<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.350> way<00:02:57.830> because<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
simple right refer this way because I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.240 
simple right refer this way because I
have<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.430> take<00:02:59.700> care<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:00.300> finger<00:03:00.980> not<00:03:01.980> gonna

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
have to take care of my finger not gonna

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.760 
have to take care of my finger not gonna
be<00:03:02.430> cut<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.110> also<00:03:04.880> cut<00:03:05.880> them<00:03:06.600> soft<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.230> me

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:20.000 

gentle<00:03:10.770> gentle<00:03:11.640> way<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:18.350> really<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.980> make

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
gentle gentle way I really like to make

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.680 
gentle gentle way I really like to make
jump<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.830> don't<00:03:23.310> need<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.480> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
jump so you don't need to because you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.690 
jump so you don't need to because you
don't<00:03:24.840> need<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.290> hurry<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:26.459> make<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.310> can

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
don't need to hurry to make it so I can

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:51.979 
don't need to hurry to make it so I can
take<00:03:29.940> time<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.799> sugar<00:03:50.630> from<00:03:51.630> sugar

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
take time to this is a sugar from sugar

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.220 
take time to this is a sugar from sugar
cane<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.620> from<00:03:52.980> honey<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.420> beef<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:54.900> kind

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
cane up from honey it's a beef it's kind

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:10.980 
cane up from honey it's a beef it's kind
of<00:03:56.360> radish<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.190> good<00:03:59.610> for<00:03:59.959> digestion

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.960 

so<00:04:11.990> no<00:04:12.140> more<00:04:12.319> sugar<00:04:13.060> can<00:04:14.060> be<00:04:14.090> digest<00:04:15.639> for<00:04:16.639> short

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
so no more sugar can be digest for short

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.890 
so no more sugar can be digest for short
time<00:04:17.269> but<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.959> one<00:04:18.400> keeps<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.669> long<00:04:20.180> time<00:04:20.540> for

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
time but this one keeps a long time for

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.230 
time but this one keeps a long time for
digest<00:04:23.590> anyway<00:04:24.620> foundation<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.669> not<00:04:25.970> good

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
digest anyway foundation is not good

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:43.350 
digest anyway foundation is not good
then<00:04:27.139> live<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.980> for<00:04:28.280> one<00:04:29.210> or<00:04:29.240> two<00:04:29.630> hours<00:04:41.770> so

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
then live it for one or two hours so

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.390 
then live it for one or two hours so
later<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.200> see<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.800> water<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.190> little

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
later and you can see the water a little

00:04:46.400 --> 00:05:13.620 
later and you can see the water a little
bit<00:04:56.470> with<00:04:57.470> Japanese<00:04:58.510> tradition

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:23.160 

fire<00:05:17.730> so<00:05:18.730> just<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.210> sugar<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:19.930> apple<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.870> cook

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
fire so just a sugar and apple so cook

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:41.669 
fire so just a sugar and apple so cook
for<00:05:24.720> about<00:05:25.720> 40<00:05:26.230> minutes<00:05:26.590> I<00:05:26.740> think

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:41.679 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:06:15.429 

already<00:05:42.679> down<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:59.889> Boojum<00:06:02.439> 2011<00:06:13.419> finish<00:06:14.439> its

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
already down a Boojum 2011 finish its

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:24.789 
already down a Boojum 2011 finish its
same<00:06:15.769> average<00:06:18.490> it<00:06:21.490> recycle<00:06:22.490> is
