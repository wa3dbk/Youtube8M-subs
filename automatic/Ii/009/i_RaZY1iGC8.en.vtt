00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
seems to be a secret passage well it's

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.560 
seems to be a secret passage well it's
not<00:01:17.259> very<00:01:17.320> secret<00:01:17.950> it's<00:01:18.130> fairly<00:01:18.369> obvious

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
not very secret it's fairly obvious

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.480 
not very secret it's fairly obvious

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
it I certainly wouldn't be thinking

he has seemed to clear most of these

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.550 
he has seemed to clear most of these
buildings<00:02:03.549> now<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:03.939> he<00:02:04.000> just<00:02:04.330> has<00:02:04.570> his<00:02:05.140> Queen

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have done really well but he's waiting

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.530 
have done really well but he's waiting
now<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:30.160> probably<00:02:30.549> would<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:30.910> deployed<00:02:31.329> my

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
now I probably would have deployed my

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.300 
now I probably would have deployed my
queen<00:02:31.810> already<00:02:32.200> whilst<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.680> Expo<00:02:33.130> was

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
queen already whilst that Expo was

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.370 
queen already whilst that Expo was
distracted<00:02:34.060> might<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.750> been<00:02:34.900> an<00:02:34.989> idea<00:02:35.260> but

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
distracted might have been an idea but

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.199 
distracted might have been an idea but
here<00:02:35.530> she<00:02:35.680> goes<00:02:35.890> he's<00:02:36.549> placed<00:02:36.910> her<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.180> the

go in from the right-hand side here

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.930 
go in from the right-hand side here
we'll<00:06:11.469> try<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.800> get<00:06:11.919> to<00:06:12.130> those<00:06:12.310> two<00:06:12.580> splash
