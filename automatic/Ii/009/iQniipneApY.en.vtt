00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everyone welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.190
 video today we see create a selection 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.640
 perfect using the channels of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.640
 photoshop 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.699
 here we are with our photograph 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.160
 assuming you want to make a selection 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.699
 of ours and we see it how to do it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 with photoshop channels 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 I warn you immediately that with say 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 the advent of new versions of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 photoshop and then with the addition of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 best button on board we have seen 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.100
 also in a video that then last on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 channel this method of selections with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.290
 the channels in photoshop you went a little 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.719
 losing because the opportunity anyway 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 of the best on board that offers us photos 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.120
 this allows us to make selections 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 almost perfect however we see how 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.390
 use this method because often e 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 gladly it can still be useful 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.969
 however, to make the selections is a bit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 as in all things know the various 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.489
 methods then allows us to obtain the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.649
 greater mastery of the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.240
 of the software in question therefore there 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.369
 we transfer to the channel palette e 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.850
 we see that using the channels of the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.080
 red green and blue we get some 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.289
 let's say some black and white photos if 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.970
 so we want different and right up 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.580
 this black and white we're going to act 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.850
 to get a selection I tell you all 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.049
 immediately we will not work 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.640
 directly on these channels because 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.890
 working on these channels then we will go to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000
 modify our overall 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.819
 photography therefore there will be variations 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 of color of shades and anything else but 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.789
 we're going to create on copies 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.979
 we're going to work studying copies 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.720
 of the channel in question by going to 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.580
 look so before that the red 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.979
 green then down 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.929
 let's try to understand what the structure is 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.709
 best to work on ours 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.530
 sky 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.330
 we see that red is already a good channel 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.939
 however the sky is a shade a 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.459
 that goes from black to white 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.569
 so let's see if we get anything from 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.360
 better 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.149
 already the green presents a situation is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 different we have a central white e 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.090
 a black shade on the edges as if 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.130
 a radial blur was a school 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.359
 a shade to the other 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.549
 as for blue instead 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.380
 surely we get more heaven 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.720
 more white than the others 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.510
 but let's analyze the mountains 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.829
 under the mountains below and the lake then 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.440
 we don't care because we will eliminate it 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.329
 directly they said mountain below 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.500
 here they are black enough 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 uniform so easy to change 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.340
 the same cannot be said of the green in 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.430
 when there are patches 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.600
 white in these mountains 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.389
 as for red still 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.819
 worse because they still appear 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.260
 areas even clearer than that 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.250
 to the green channel so I would say of 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.170
 work on the canal 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 therefore it seems to me the most suitable therefore 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.280
 let's drag to take the left button 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.310
 the bottom icon sings 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.540
 trash can to create a copy layer a 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.530
 caterpillar which we therefore try to 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.150
 select the sky then do it 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.730
 become white because as we have 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 seen in the level masks what 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.750
 it is white what black is shown 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.970
 is hidden 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.530
 so we can use the channels of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.840
 checks we get from the menu 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.430
 image adjustments or brightness 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 the contrast value for a value 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.690
 curve channel and anything else but 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.550
 above all we can use the voice 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.600
 then apply image as far as 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.090
 concerns the adjustments using tele 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.739
 then make the changes, for example 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.900
 tonal values allow us to act 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.090
 as you can see on ours 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.040
 photography going to clear certain 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.319
 areas and dark others is already in this 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.549
 so we'll have it anyway 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.379
 the modification of the sky and the mountains 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.090
 quite good 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.730
 but what I recommend to the 10 of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.530
 touch them as little as possible because they go into 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.219
 a certain kind and without ruining the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.689
 our image of the copy channel 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.819
 therefore it adds risk of starting the 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.590
 more often than not with the command apply 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.719
 image ie in the pleated command 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.209
 image we will use the overlay item 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:11.040
 which basically makes it clearer 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.540
 what is clear is to make it darker 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.489
 what is safe 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.989
 as you can see the mountains 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.459
 they were dark they become even darker 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.070
 the sky that was clear still becomes 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.789
 brighter and we're going to apply it 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.199
 precisely on the blue channel copies of course 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.430
 with a level just because we do n't have 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.800
 we did not have other levels 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.750
 in the relative palette and obviously the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.630
 source one because we are working on 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.699
 this image then we give ok e 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.370
 compared to before we had a 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.789
 intensification of highlights and lights 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.270
 darker areas in ours in ours 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.250
 image 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.789
 then we take a selection tool 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.539
 in this case our rectangle e 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.639
 we make a selection of this kind 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:58.289
 all along we say the horizon of the lake 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:00.659
 and let's fill up then fill up with 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:06.060
 black all our selection going 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:09.330
 on modification it filled black content then 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.520
 we choose black and we give ok it's all this 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.860
 area is obviously filled true 15 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.599
 only the mountains remain 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.789
 and we should go and change how 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.710
 thanks to the use of the brush then 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.069
 take b from the keyboard or select the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.340
 brush and make sure we put it in 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.979
 then the method overlaps 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.669
 let's zoom in on our photo there 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.590
 we move to the mountains with white 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.189
 in the foreground we are going to brush the 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:42.349
 heaven and then we make it what it is 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:43.939
 white we make it more white in this 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.599
 so be careful not to take too much 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:50.620
 mountains and this process we do it 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.620
 all over the sky 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.699
 in this way 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.699
 I repeat, paying attention not to 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.330
 affect the mountains too much then 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.330
 this way 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.140
 later with keyboard hicks 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.250
 let's put the black in the foreground 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.380
 as you can see 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.730
 and we pass in the mountains you see that the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.980
 mountains become even more black 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.860
 while the sky remains white therefore 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.450
 made this pass of black on 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.550
 mountains to define the contour well 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:36.040
 we put the white in the foreground e 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.040
 let's move on to remove the halo of jo 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.760
 in this way 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:51.240
 and then last pass of white for 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.550
 make virtually the whole uniform 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.770
 white of the sky at this point against 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.300
 by keyboards click on our mask 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.980
 of selection we have selected the 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.480
 so why do we click on schemes 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.890
 to see our image 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.170
 we have the sky situation on which 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.890
 then we can apply the various levels of 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.910
 filling and adjustment and how you can 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.180
 see we made a selection 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.590
 perfect for our side dishes 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.940
 mountains 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.570
 if we go to zoom we can also 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.680
 note in some cases not always a 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.730
 depending on how the was made 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.780
 selection of a very light halo 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:33.170
 so let's say it's not a big deal 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.400
 because we could go with double click 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.730
 on our mask to increase the 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.750
 shade of a few pixels and see that 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.010
 the halo already disappears compared to before 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.750
 very well we saw how to create a 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.940
 selection mask thanks 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.960
 to use channel in photoshop not 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.390
 you just have to try and experiment 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.620
 this new method of selection if the 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.760
 video you enjoyed sharing it 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.440
 social network 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.390
 put a thumb up the name 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.860
 like and maybe even sign up at 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.480
 channel if you didn't 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.010
