00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 borscht and air even the most juicy 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.679
 the latest news from the world of tanks and today 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 what happens to the slippers on the seventh 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.570
 level which tanks can be entered into 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 game soon and also a lot 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 interesting news related here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:29.670
 fuck it go poor miserable vk 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 4502 n who is known in common 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 how sneakers will be moved to the seventh 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520
 level and will not be given just like that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.590
 but this is not really for anyone 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.969
 not news however became known 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 some new details regarding 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.399
 his particular characteristics are talking about 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 armor 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.820
 well, everything else you can too 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 see right now on their screens and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.500
 moving the tank by two 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.570
 the level below will not pass without a trace 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 armor as you see will be frankly 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 weak for the seventh level however 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.300
 tiger 1 with it lives and quite well 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 copes and is at the same time one of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.760
 the best is 7 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 and all thanks yes to this gun 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 quite good heavy tank speed rather 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.369
 not even the maximum 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 speed how many acceleration dynamics are so 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.530
 or else in all these parameters new 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 bkp also not deprived this concerns and dpm 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.500
 about of despite the fact that the guns 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 almost the same does not punch too 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.610
 the same damage but still quick- 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350
 much worse here and it concerns 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.939
 top speed even though the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.780
 the fact that the engines here are the same as on 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.790
 the first tiger 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.229
 but due to the fact that the tank itself weighs a little 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 more power density is obtained 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.189
 respectively less from here and below 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 maximum speed so why me 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.159
 it seems that this car will 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.409
 play just to honor 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.119
 the memory of the old sneaker is not yet known 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.610
 how many people in this car 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.119
 be able to go okay let's go 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.430
 farther 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.320
 rumors appeared i emphasize this rumors 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.930
 that such machines will be introduced into the game 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 as object 701 hyphen one which 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.800
 There are prototypes of 4 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.570
 as well as the German standard until panzer 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.400
 that it is absolutely unclear whether these 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.840
 information at least some truthful 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.430
 so it is worth waiting for the official 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 developer statements 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.110
 but by the way, I wouldn't be surprised at all 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.850
 if a similar car appeared in the game 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.729
 next news world of tanks blitz in 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 one year and therefore the developers of this 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.330
 the project decided to share answers to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.250
 some questions so for example absolutely 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.410
 It is known for sure that by the end of the year this 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.870
 the game will be visible and the new nation is true 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.010
 What exactly it is not specified as 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.380
 planned to enter this game 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 training rooms backend 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.280
 Already ready to finish 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.050
 the interface is also planned 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.980
 appearance of dynamic characteristics 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.220
 equipment in the hangar 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 as well as reducing the client of the game itself but 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 and perhaps worth adding a little 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.470
 information that in wot blitz 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.300
 It is planned to introduce voice communication and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 it is even possible that this feature in this game 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 much more than the version on 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 PC. 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.270
 but for now I can only say one thing 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 I personally would like to see a version for now. 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.959
 wot blitz and I know it's pretty ridiculous 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.790
 and wishes but still 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.070
 probably mainly because in 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.720
 This version does not have art and as they say 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.120
 the developers themselves are not you and because they do not 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.530
 it would play quite not comfort but I 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.299
 I think this is not about management because 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.430
 what really where-where she tablets depth arte 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.320
 playing is just perfect but really 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.660
 it was not introduced because I popped it would be 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.430
 nowhere to get out of nowhere to throw it 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.430
 quickly discovered and of course 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.019
 have contained also added that the variety tests 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.630
 and held but in the final result 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.239
 decided to completely abandon it but 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.310
 Well done and on this optimistic note I 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.200
 finish today's issue 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.120
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel here 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.959
 fan as well as on my own channel where 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.329
 you will find lots 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.820
 most interesting video and it was the transfer 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.230
 easy digests and leading borges layer 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.230
 I say goodbye to new meetings
