00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
bushings in them there are univille

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.179 
bushings in them there are univille
bushings<00:00:14.450> to<00:00:14.929> get<00:00:15.349> rid<00:00:15.500> of<00:00:15.530> our<00:00:15.709> compliance

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
bushings to get rid of our compliance

bushings to get rid of our compliance
bushings<00:00:17.200> basically<00:00:18.200> the<00:00:18.500> rubber<00:00:18.710> factory

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
bushings basically the rubber factory

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.460 
bushings basically the rubber factory
bushings<00:00:19.310> have<00:00:20.119> given<00:00:20.570> them<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.050> under<00:00:21.230> heavy

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
bushings have given them so under heavy

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.859 
bushings have given them so under heavy
braking<00:00:21.710> heavy<00:00:22.340> loaded<00:00:22.759> suspension<00:00:23.390> you'll

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
braking heavy loaded suspension you'll

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.170 
braking heavy loaded suspension you'll
get<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> lot<00:00:24.289> of<00:00:24.470> change<00:00:25.279> in<00:00:25.490> geometry<00:00:25.640> of<00:00:26.090> your

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
get a lot of change in geometry of your

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.120 
get a lot of change in geometry of your
suspension<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:27.500> wanted<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.770> get<00:00:27.890> rid<00:00:27.950> of

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
suspension so we wanted to get rid of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.589 
suspension so we wanted to get rid of
these<00:00:28.250> bushings<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:28.910> go<00:00:29.059> something<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:29.419> little

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
these bushings and go something a little

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.859 
these bushings and go something a little
bit<00:00:29.689> more

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
bit more

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.160 
bit more
well<00:00:30.470> track<00:00:31.279> setup<00:00:31.790> cool<00:00:32.750> part<00:00:32.930> about<00:00:33.020> these

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
well track setup cool part about these

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.590 
well track setup cool part about these
bushings<00:00:33.680> well<00:00:34.040> as<00:00:34.130> installing<00:00:34.550> them<00:00:34.700> is<00:00:34.850> if

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
bushings well as installing them is if

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.299 
bushings well as installing them is if
you<00:00:35.690> notice<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:36.260> bushing<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:37.010> bottom

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
you notice that this bushing the bottom

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.400 
you notice that this bushing the bottom
piece<00:00:37.520> has<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.880> chamfer<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.600> end<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:39.050> it

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
piece has a chamfer at end on it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.830 
piece has a chamfer at end on it
actually<00:00:40.100> there<00:00:40.730> was<00:00:40.790> designed<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.480> when<00:00:41.660> I<00:00:41.690> go

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
actually there was designed so when I go

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.119 
actually there was designed so when I go
to<00:00:41.870> press<00:00:42.110> these<00:00:42.260> bushings<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:42.739> they<00:00:42.890> drop

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
to press these bushings and they drop

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.470 
to press these bushings and they drop
right<00:00:43.309> in<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.520> hole<00:00:43.700> they<00:00:44.000> automatically

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
right in the hole they automatically

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.540 
right in the hole they automatically
line<00:00:44.809> up<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.199> they<00:00:45.559> pressed<00:00:45.859> in<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.100> lot<00:00:46.219> easier

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
line up and they pressed in a lot easier

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.639 
line up and they pressed in a lot easier
due<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.030> actual<00:00:47.449> Ridge<00:00:47.690> cut<00:00:48.019> in<00:00:48.170> tomb

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
due to this actual Ridge cut in tomb

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.680 
due to this actual Ridge cut in tomb
I'm<00:00:49.129> also<00:00:49.339> looking<00:00:49.730> at<00:00:49.879> these<00:00:49.969> Ginga<00:00:50.539> ball

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
I'm also looking at these Ginga ball

hopefully<00:01:21.680> on<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.829> track<00:01:22.189> we<00:01:22.399> can<00:01:22.490> actually

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
hopefully on the track we can actually

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.480 
hopefully on the track we can actually
see<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.479> great<00:01:24.259> difference<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:25.009> how<00:01:25.430> the

under heavy braking and in cornering

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.240 
under heavy braking and in cornering
that<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.210> guitar<00:01:32.539> alignment<00:01:33.140> would<00:01:33.320> change

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
that the guitar alignment would change

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.969
