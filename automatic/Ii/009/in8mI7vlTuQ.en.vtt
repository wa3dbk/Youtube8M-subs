kind always try to get a board that has

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.310 
kind always try to get a board that has
FCS<00:01:25.070> because<00:01:25.610> there's<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.840> readily<00:01:27.200> available

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
FCS because there's so readily available

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.100 
FCS because there's so readily available
but<00:01:28.130> also<00:01:28.310> there's<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.240> many<00:01:29.360> companies<00:01:29.899> out

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
there that the duplicate or make you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.260 
there that the duplicate or make you

know their non name-brand fins or their
name-brand<00:01:35.719> fins<00:01:36.140> even<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.520> know<00:01:37.640> are

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
name-brand fins even that you know are

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.080 
name-brand fins even that you know are
an<00:01:37.850> FCS<00:01:38.299> base<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.649> just<00:01:40.040> have<00:01:40.219> a<00:01:40.250> huge

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
an FCS base so you just have a huge

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.520 
an FCS base so you just have a huge
variety<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.840> fins<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.229> can

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
variety of fins you can

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
variety of fins you can

lock box and glass ons and it literally

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.700 
lock box and glass ons and it literally
changed<00:02:01.850> my<00:02:02.360> surfing<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.960> don't<00:02:03.170> think<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
changed my surfing I don't think that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.730 
changed my surfing I don't think that
the<00:02:04.009> way<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.369> fin<00:02:04.550> was<00:02:04.729> attached<00:02:05.590> kind<00:02:06.590> of

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the way the fin was attached kind of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740 
the way the fin was attached kind of
either<00:02:06.799> like<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.070> border<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.549> didn't<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.600> know

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
either like a border I didn't you know

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.630 
either like a border I didn't you know
but<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.500> FCS<00:02:12.500> has<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.770> great<00:02:13.400> variety

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
but up you know FCS has a great variety

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.720 
but up you know FCS has a great variety
of<00:02:14.090> fins<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.870> they<00:02:15.080> definitely<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.730> their

don't<00:02:23.540> exist<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.260> FCS<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.209> really

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
don't exist in FCS so you can really

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.990 
don't exist in FCS so you can really
just<00:02:27.019> go<00:02:27.380> nuts<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.010> play<00:02:28.190> with<00:02:28.400> fins<00:02:28.670> so

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
just go nuts and play with fins so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.170 
just go nuts and play with fins so
that's<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.420> prime<00:02:29.900> macaco<00:02:30.560> fins<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
that's a prime macaco fins this is a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.449 
that's a prime macaco fins this is a

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
where we should start probably then

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.270 
where we should start probably then
everyone's<00:02:34.910> seen<00:02:35.269> before<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:36.500> standard

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
Long Wharf in all fins kind of work

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.270 
Long Wharf in all fins kind of work
together<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.840> same<00:02:42.080> way<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.250> doesn't

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
together in the same way so it doesn't

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.390 
together in the same way so it doesn't
matter<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:45.110> know<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.500> thing<00:02:45.830> or

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
matter if it's a you know one thing or

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.699 
matter if it's a you know one thing or
as<00:02:47.120> many<00:02:47.329> things<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.840> want<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.200> little<00:02:48.530> board

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
as many things you want a little board

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.770 
as many things you want a little board
but<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.790> all<00:02:50.030> works<00:02:50.329> on<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.900> fins<00:02:51.590> rake<00:02:52.450> how<00:02:53.450> far

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
but it all works on a fins rake how far

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.729 
but it all works on a fins rake how far
rakes<00:02:54.079> back<00:02:54.489> fins<00:02:55.489> lengths<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.049> fins<00:02:57.320> base

rakes back fins lengths the fins base

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.030 
rakes back fins lengths the fins base
which<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.820> wide<00:02:59.510> mister<00:02:59.959> here<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.920> know

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
which is the wide mister here you know

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
which is the wide mister here you know
those<00:03:01.220> things<00:03:01.519> all<00:03:01.910> determine<00:03:02.720> how<00:03:02.840> far<00:03:03.110> it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
those things all determine how far it's

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.289 
those things all determine how far it's
going<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.470> ride<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.030> same

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
going to ride so if you have the same

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.410 
going to ride so if you have the same
fit<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.750> imagine

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
fit and imagine

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.690 
fit and imagine
and<00:03:06.540> being<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.380> box<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.490> could

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
and being in the box but you could

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.120 
and being in the box but you could
adjust<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> state<00:03:09.840> Finn's<00:03:10.230> ranked<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.860> this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
adjust the state Finn's ranked like this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
adjust the state Finn's ranked like this
it<00:03:11.849> would<00:03:12.030> make<00:03:12.180> your<00:03:12.300> turns<00:03:12.569> longer<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.260> more

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it would make your turns longer and more

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.309 
it would make your turns longer and more
drawn<00:03:13.680> out<00:03:13.880> if<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.090> took<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.300> same<00:03:15.480> Finn<00:03:16.020> you

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
drawn out if you took that same Finn you

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.370 
drawn out if you took that same Finn you
drop<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.130> rake<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.640> like<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.989> would<00:03:19.170> now

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
drop the rake up like this it would now

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.070 
drop the rake up like this it would now
take<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.980> make<00:03:20.130> your<00:03:20.310> turns<00:03:20.580> closer<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.660> you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
take and make your turns closer and you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.190 
take and make your turns closer and you
know<00:03:22.230> tighter<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.780> those<00:03:25.020> are

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
know tighter like this and so those are

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.100 
know tighter like this and so those are
just<00:03:25.830> some<00:03:26.250> real<00:03:26.459> simple<00:03:26.880> things<00:03:27.150> then<00:03:28.020> you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
just some real simple things then you

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.540 
just some real simple things then you
start<00:03:28.350> playing<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.739> bends<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.310> can

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
start playing with bends and you can

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
start playing with bends and you can
start<00:03:29.760> adjusting<00:03:29.880> widths<00:03:30.690> kind<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.230> got<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> few

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
start adjusting widths kind of got a few

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.960 
start adjusting widths kind of got a few
examples<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.519> we'll<00:03:35.640> hold<00:03:35.790> these

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
examples here see and we'll hold these

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.990 
examples here see and we'll hold these
up<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.860> want<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.160> start<00:03:38.340> with<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.580> fin<00:03:38.790> like

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
up if you want to start with a fin like

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.729 
up if you want to start with a fin like
this<00:03:39.300> which<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> looking<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.260> pretty<00:03:40.500> long

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
this which is looking a pretty long

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.370 
this which is looking a pretty long
Ricky<00:03:41.310> fans<00:03:41.610> got<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.910> little<00:03:42.060> flex<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.630> but

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
Ricky fans got a little flex to it but

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.330 
Ricky fans got a little flex to it but
it's<00:03:43.530> got<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> pretty<00:03:43.980> big<00:03:44.190> base<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:47.010> little

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
it's got a pretty big base it's a little

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's got a pretty big base it's a little
more<00:03:47.459> stable<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.150> will<00:03:48.239> also<00:03:48.360> be<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> little

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
more stable and it will also be a little

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.680 
more stable and it will also be a little
better<00:03:49.350> for<00:03:49.590> nose<00:03:49.769> riding<00:03:50.069> as<00:03:50.640> as<00:03:51.390> well<00:03:51.569> as

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
better for nose riding as as well as

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.420 
better for nose riding as as well as
keeping<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.110> board<00:03:52.380> loose<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.890> giving

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
keeping the board loose and giving

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
keeping the board loose and giving
maneuverable<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.540> single<00:03:54.900> fin<00:03:55.049> scenario

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
maneuverable in a single fin scenario

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.860 
maneuverable in a single fin scenario
but<00:03:56.489> if<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.760> want<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.209> get<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> little<00:03:57.630> more

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
but if you want to get a little more

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.140 
but if you want to get a little more
performance<00:03:58.290> out<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.459> can<00:03:59.610> take<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.819> fin

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
performance out of it you can take a fin

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.140 
performance out of it you can take a fin
similar<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.930> one<00:04:01.310> which<00:04:02.310> isn't<00:04:02.700> quite<00:04:02.910> as

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
similar to this one which isn't quite as

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.449 
similar to this one which isn't quite as
long<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:04.080> shows<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.590> where<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.799> base<00:04:05.430> is

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
long but it shows you where the base is

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.390 
long but it shows you where the base is
been<00:04:05.880> chopped<00:04:06.150> down<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:07.350> my<00:04:07.590> best<00:04:07.860> example

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
been chopped down and my best example

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.670 
been chopped down and my best example
for<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:11.570> in<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.750> setup<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.470> board

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
for that is this in a setup and a board

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.490 
for that is this in a setup and a board
I'm<00:04:13.829> riding<00:04:14.220> now<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> do<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.329> I've<00:04:16.260> been

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
I'm riding now I do this I've been

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.140 
I'm riding now I do this I've been
riding<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:17.209> glass<00:04:18.209> fin<00:04:18.600> here<00:04:19.970> because<00:04:20.970> it's

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
riding this glass fin here because it's

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.140 
riding this glass fin here because it's

the same fin template but it's missing a
lot<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.690> through<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:26.160> what

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
lot of this through here and so what

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.150 
lot of this through here and so what
it's<00:04:26.460> done<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.910> where<00:04:27.600> I've<00:04:27.780> gone<00:04:27.990> up<00:04:28.229> off<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
it's done is where I've gone up off the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.730 
it's done is where I've gone up off the
bottom<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.729> done<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> floater<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.380> I'm<00:04:31.470> trying

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
bottom and done a floater and I'm trying

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.170 
bottom and done a floater and I'm trying
to<00:04:31.800> get<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.010> board<00:04:32.220> back<00:04:32.280> around<00:04:32.729> it<00:04:32.940> seems

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
to get the board back around it seems

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.870 
to get the board back around it seems
like<00:04:33.450> up<00:04:33.690> in<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.200> all<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.890> base<00:04:35.160> kind<00:04:35.760> of

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
like up in here all this base kind of

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.390 
like up in here all this base kind of
hangs<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.539> little<00:04:36.690> bit<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.620> by<00:04:37.830> taking<00:04:38.100> a

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
hangs you up a little bit so by taking a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.210 
hangs you up a little bit so by taking a
fin<00:04:38.669> very<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:40.050> know<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.229> same<00:04:40.470> template<00:04:41.010> but

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
fin very you know the same template but

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.159 
fin very you know the same template but
getting<00:04:41.460> rid<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.419> allows<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.810> board

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
getting rid of that it allows the board

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.620 
getting rid of that it allows the board
to<00:04:43.229> kind<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.620> drop<00:04:44.490> freely<00:04:45.060> through<00:04:45.360> there<00:04:45.479> I

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
to kind of drop freely through there I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.900 
to kind of drop freely through there I
find<00:04:46.020> those<00:04:46.560> riding<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.400> know<00:04:47.490> these<00:04:47.640> are

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
find those riding you know these are

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.969 
find those riding you know these are
something<00:04:48.780> they've<00:04:49.410> been<00:04:49.440> around<00:04:49.800> forever

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
something they've been around forever

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.710 
something they've been around forever
but<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.820> they<00:04:51.120> weren't<00:04:51.270> readily<00:04:51.539> available

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
but you they weren't readily available

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.110 
but you they weren't readily available
on<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.350> market<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:52.890> they<00:04:53.039> are<00:04:53.160> today<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.729> lot

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
on the market like they are today a lot

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.060 
on the market like they are today a lot
of<00:04:54.270> fun<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:55.500> by<00:04:55.680> simply<00:04:56.070> going<00:04:56.310> from

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
of fun just by simply going from

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.310 
of fun just by simply going from
you<00:04:57.130> know<00:04:57.280> fins<00:04:58.090> like<00:04:58.330> this<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.810> fins<00:04:59.080> like

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
you know fins like this the fins like

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.200 
you know fins like this the fins like
this<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.800> can<00:04:59.950> take<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.280> same<00:05:00.520> board<00:05:00.940> and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
this you can take the same board and

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.920 
this you can take the same board and
make<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.350> feel<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:03.070> know<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.570> can<00:05:04.570> just<00:05:04.750> went

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
make it feel you know I can just went

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.350 
make it feel you know I can just went
through<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.140> time<00:05:05.350> warp<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.920> back<00:05:06.520> in<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.850> 60s

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
through a time warp and back in the 60s

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.380 
through a time warp and back in the 60s
with<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> fin<00:05:07.810> like<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.500> lot<00:05:09.070> of<00:05:09.130> fun<00:05:09.390> you

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
with a fin like this a lot of fun you

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.140 
with a fin like this a lot of fun you
know<00:05:10.510> different<00:05:11.110> templates<00:05:12.010> but<00:05:12.730> you<00:05:12.880> got<00:05:13.000> to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
know different templates but you got to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.090 
know different templates but you got to
realize<00:05:13.270> when<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:13.750> play<00:05:13.960> with<00:05:14.170> fins<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.860> is

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
realize when you play with fins to is

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.550 
realize when you play with fins to is
you<00:05:15.490> know<00:05:15.610> just<00:05:15.850> because<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:17.140> put<00:05:17.530> a

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
you know just because you put a

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.390 
you know just because you put a
different<00:05:17.920> fit<00:05:18.070> in<00:05:18.190> your<00:05:18.310> box<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:19.510> know<00:05:20.400> the

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
different fit in your box you know the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.450 
different fit in your box you know the
way<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.550> fence<00:05:21.910> sits<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.630> Box<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:24.340> know

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
way a fence sits in the Box you know

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000 
way a fence sits in the Box you know
your<00:05:24.820> fin<00:05:25.150> might<00:05:25.600> sit<00:05:25.870> in<00:05:25.900> the<00:05:25.990> same<00:05:26.200> place<00:05:26.260> but

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
your fin might sit in the same place but

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.880 
your fin might sit in the same place but
where<00:05:27.730> it<00:05:27.910> templates<00:05:28.720> its<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.320> completely

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
where it templates its is completely

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.920 
where it templates its is completely
different<00:05:30.370> so<00:05:30.640> that's<00:05:31.120> going<00:05:31.390> to<00:05:31.480> change<00:05:31.750> the

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
different so that's going to change the

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.570 
different so that's going to change the
way<00:05:32.050> your<00:05:32.200> board<00:05:32.440> rides<00:05:32.740> dramatically

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
way your board rides dramatically

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.360 
way your board rides dramatically
because<00:05:34.150> you've<00:05:34.480> got<00:05:34.890> you<00:05:35.890> know<00:05:35.980> two<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.340> a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
because you've got you know two and a

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.370 
because you've got you know two and a
half<00:05:36.520> inch<00:05:36.820> difference<00:05:37.720> in<00:05:37.870> where<00:05:37.990> your<00:05:38.140> fence

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
half inch difference in where your fence

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.570 
half inch difference in where your fence
is<00:05:38.620> which<00:05:38.890> is<00:05:39.040> huge

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
is which is huge

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.870 
is which is huge
if<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.390> fin<00:05:40.870> was<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.110> lot<00:05:41.380> able<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:42.160> sit<00:05:42.490> in<00:05:42.670> the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
if the fin was a lot able to sit in the

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.780 
if the fin was a lot able to sit in the
box<00:05:43.090> like<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.290> you<00:05:45.010> probably<00:05:45.250> wouldn't<00:05:45.640> feel

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
box like this you probably wouldn't feel

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.660 
box like this you probably wouldn't feel
such<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.120> dramatic<00:05:46.330> change<00:05:47.250> but<00:05:48.250> definitely

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
such a dramatic change but definitely

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.240 
such a dramatic change but definitely
would<00:05:48.820> get<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.000> looser<00:05:49.750> feel<00:05:50.470> compared<00:05:51.010> to<00:05:51.100> this

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
would get a looser feel compared to this

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.470 
would get a looser feel compared to this
big<00:05:51.550> guy<00:05:52.620> in<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.800> way<00:05:53.920> it<00:05:54.070> turns<00:05:54.370> but<00:05:54.850> these

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
big guy in the way it turns but these

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.780 
big guy in the way it turns but these
big<00:05:55.780> fins<00:05:56.110> are<00:05:56.320> fun<00:05:56.530> I've<00:05:56.830> found<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:57.490> fins

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
big fins are fun I've found that fins

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.600 
big fins are fun I've found that fins
with<00:05:58.000> this<00:05:58.150> rounded<00:05:58.600> back<00:05:58.810> edge<00:05:59.080> have<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.830> weird

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
with this rounded back edge have a weird

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.260 
with this rounded back edge have a weird
little<00:06:00.910> way<00:06:01.750> they<00:06:01.990> they<00:06:02.290> kind<00:06:02.560> of<00:06:03.270> manipulate

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
little way they they kind of manipulate

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.390 
little way they they kind of manipulate
through<00:06:04.540> a<00:06:04.570> turn<00:06:04.900> that's<00:06:05.590> kind<00:06:06.010> of<00:06:06.070> hard<00:06:06.310> to

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
through a turn that's kind of hard to

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.600 
through a turn that's kind of hard to
explain<00:06:06.850> but<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.540> enjoy<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.500> it's<00:06:09.280> really

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
explain but I enjoy that it's really

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.010 
explain but I enjoy that it's really
cool<00:06:09.850> to<00:06:10.000> write<00:06:10.150> authority<00:06:10.330> of<00:06:10.720> whatever

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
cool to write authority of whatever

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.830 
cool to write authority of whatever
weird<00:06:11.230> rides<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:12.460> know<00:06:12.670> looking<00:06:13.360> at<00:06:13.540> fins

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
weird rides you know looking at fins

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.280 
weird rides you know looking at fins
it's<00:06:14.110> good<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.560> kind<00:06:15.400> of<00:06:15.630> grab<00:06:16.630> fins<00:06:17.020> and

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
it's good to kind of grab fins and

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.050 
it's good to kind of grab fins and
compare<00:06:17.650> them<00:06:17.800> like<00:06:17.980> this<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:18.280> know<00:06:18.610> hold<00:06:18.910> the

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
compare them like this you know hold the

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.290 
compare them like this you know hold the
tabs<00:06:19.300> together<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:21.040> now<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.550> can<00:06:21.760> see<00:06:22.060> in

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
tabs together and now you can see in

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.510 
tabs together and now you can see in
your<00:06:22.780> board<00:06:23.140> where<00:06:23.410> the<00:06:23.620> fins<00:06:23.860> going<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.250> sit

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
your board where the fins going to sit

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.330 
your board where the fins going to sit
so<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:25.270> can<00:06:25.660> see<00:06:25.870> you<00:06:26.350> know<00:06:26.500> a<00:06:26.530> pretty<00:06:27.040> drastic

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
so you can see you know a pretty drastic

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.750 
so you can see you know a pretty drastic
change<00:06:27.940> there<00:06:28.360> you<00:06:29.140> know<00:06:29.290> to<00:06:30.100> people<00:06:30.430> that

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
change there you know to people that

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.730 
change there you know to people that
don't<00:06:31.030> know<00:06:31.210> much<00:06:31.390> about<00:06:31.420> fins<00:06:31.990> they<00:06:32.260> look<00:06:32.620> at

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
don't know much about fins they look at

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.560 
don't know much about fins they look at
that<00:06:32.890> and<00:06:33.040> they<00:06:33.100> go<00:06:33.130> that's<00:06:33.400> not<00:06:33.610> very<00:06:33.880> drastic

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
that and they go that's not very drastic

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.960 
that and they go that's not very drastic
but<00:06:34.930> put<00:06:35.890> that<00:06:35.920> in<00:06:36.190> your<00:06:36.220> board<00:06:36.520> and<00:06:36.700> try<00:06:36.910> it

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
but put that in your board and try it

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.970 
but put that in your board and try it
and<00:06:37.210> you'll<00:06:37.330> definitely<00:06:37.840> feel<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.110> drastic

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
and you'll definitely feel a drastic

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.030 
and you'll definitely feel a drastic
difference<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:40.780> same<00:06:41.050> rules<00:06:41.320> apply<00:06:41.470> to<00:06:41.680> these

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
difference the same rules apply to these

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.680 
difference the same rules apply to these
fins<00:06:42.460> as<00:06:42.730> these<00:06:43.300> fins<00:06:43.630> you<00:06:44.410> know<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:45.190> base<00:06:45.690> the

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
fins as these fins you know the base the

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.810 
fins as these fins you know the base the
rake<00:06:46.930> back<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.800> length<00:06:48.070> of<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:48.370> fin<00:06:48.580> all

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
rake back the length of the fin all

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.510 
rake back the length of the fin all
makes<00:06:49.060> a<00:06:49.240> difference<00:06:49.980> there's<00:06:50.980> a<00:06:51.070> lot<00:06:51.340> that

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
makes a difference there's a lot that

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.520 
makes a difference there's a lot that
goes<00:06:51.550> into<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:52.480> where<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.780> fins<00:06:53.050> are<00:06:53.230> actually

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
goes into to where the fins are actually

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.110 
goes into to where the fins are actually
positioned<00:06:54.040> in<00:06:54.190> your<00:06:54.370> you<00:06:54.640> know<00:06:54.760> the<00:06:54.850> plugs

you first get a boarder should ask the

you first get a boarder should ask the
guy<00:07:00.520> a<00:07:00.550> little<00:07:00.850> bit<00:07:01.090> about<00:07:01.300> it<00:07:01.540> and<00:07:01.600> what<00:07:01.960> kind

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
guy a little bit about it and what kind

guy a little bit about it and what kind
of<00:07:02.200> fins<00:07:02.410> they<00:07:02.650> might<00:07:02.860> recommend<00:07:03.190> for<00:07:03.670> you<00:07:03.820> you

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
of fins they might recommend for you you

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.290 
of fins they might recommend for you you
know<00:07:04.690> because<00:07:04.960> if<00:07:05.110> you

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
know because if you
