00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello everyone, how are you doing? 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.010
 find very well today I bring you the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 part 3 of curiosities but this time already 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 they will not be pokemon x and now they will be 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 I'll try old curiosities 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.699
 bring little-known curiosities 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's start with the video always in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.660
 some pokemon video games is nor the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 chs blocks the routes and prevents you from passing 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.220
 and for this you need to fight against him 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.830
 also in the pokemon videogame 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.990
 stadium pokemon stadium 2 pokemon 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 colosseum xd and pokemon battle the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 revolution in animation when it is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 weakened opens his eyes in the anime he 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.410
 presents this he did as one of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660
 faster pokemon is even reached 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.079
 to know as the red lightning though 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 his speed in games is very low 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 according to the guinness world records n occupies 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 the twentieth place of the best 50 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 video game villains of all 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 times and this I think is the best 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.100
 decision for me he has the best 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.480
 story of a villain an appearance 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 smart to me is the best villain 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 of pokemon along the chain 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 evolution of torch and its statistics 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 strongest offensive changes 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 if you have the special attack greater than 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 physical attack with seek have in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.120
 balance both and vlasic in has a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.920
 greater attack than special attack good 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.229
 this is because vlasic in is kind 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 fight as a secondary and fight guys 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
 they are usually physical rather than special 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 besides that the various color of blas 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.619
 and that does not change much just the colors 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 they become darker their anpert is the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.580
 most powerful initial pokemon of all and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.320
 with fewer weaknesses followed by 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.410
 hellish but being the pokemon 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.300
 stronger initials as step 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.090
 of time people wonder why 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.770
 is still 10 years good this is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 because he is censored the age 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.619
 making him look like a child but in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 Japanese would come to be 16 years old 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.729
 anime can be a legendary pokémon 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 there are many clues that reveal it by 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.840
 example in pokemon pokédex 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.920
 yellow says is a legendary pokemon 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.899
 in China 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.390
 there they adore the grace and beauty that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.100
 exhibits when running in the pokédex of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.710
 silver pokemon this chinese pokemon 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
 legendary is considered magnificent to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 many people love their big mane 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.620
 good in pokémon heartgold says the same 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.049
 than in the Pokemon Pokédex 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.670
 also in chapter 2 of the anime 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.280
 pokemon is shown the table where 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 appear the three legendary birds what 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.970
 rare is that arca nine also appears 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.890
 while in its place I would have to 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
 be wearing not only that in the first 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.780
 opening of pokemon looks to article zar 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.060
 2 and instead of 3 appears arca nine other 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.720
 thing is that their stats are pretty 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.549
 good ones 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.709
 not to match the best pokemon 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.810
 but it has a magnificent power this you 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.599
 let's think arca nine was going to be 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.450
 legendary maybe it's semi legendary 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.730
 as it is only here lúcar yo en pokémon 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.709
 black and white and also black 2 and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.470
 white 2 victim is placed ahead 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.750
 with respect to old generations 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.849
 being the number 000 in the pokédex 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 bikini what I think could have 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.720
 I was going to come out in the fourth 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.849
 generation but having no time do not 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.599
 implemented and waited for the fifth 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.640
 generation by putting the number 000 to 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.590
 fight against legendary birds in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.409
 pokemon red fire and green leaf all 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.239
 they will say arctic being that this cry alone 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.340
 belongs to the article except when 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.500
 fight with today it looked like they would scream 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.110
 characteristic subjects 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940
 in pokémon mysterious world a world the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.130
 chs appears walking through the square 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.680
 pokemon sporadically and without saying 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.720
 nothing when talking to him what is remarkable is that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.760
 this game would belong to the third 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.710
 generation when many laxes of the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.470
 fourth generation just like I place 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.390
 ni juniors web and law bones reads that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.200
 they also appear in this title as 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 statues are the same as p 0 8 in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.010
 pokemon stadium 2 when you choose 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.720
 cruel attentive in the ultra by occupy the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.300
 tell or say narrator is a tentacle 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.510
 this error and I found it playing pokemon 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.090
 stadium 2 and I wanted to put it in the fourth 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.860
 Fan generation feet an exclusive Pokémon 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.690
 from pokémon gold heartgold but in the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.850
 second generation it was pokemon 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.800
 Silver happens the same with tedious but 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.980
 this is exclusive to pokémon soulsilver 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.110
 and of pokémon gold in the intro of pokémon 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.660
 heartgold and soul silver when the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.850
 photos of being raikou and su and kun are 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.829
 pushed by 11 that represent the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.579
 initial letter of cadhac have been 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.380
 raikou and re between each other and kun s very well 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.100
 I think it's time to start with a 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.780
 theory 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.100
 postdata the information I took it from a 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.580
 youtuber that makes videos 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.950
 this man 3000 very well in the intro of 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.660
 pokemon crystal appears I ran up and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.030
 you also see the 11 is chasing him 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.220
 when the 11 approach him he does 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.230
 flash putting us on the screen of 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.540
 start what I think is that I'm culé 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.850
 may be related to the 111 to 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.700
 just like in you and rayco this is my 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.440
 theory many years ago when the ceus 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.690
 created the pokemon world I need help 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.550
 of some pokemon that already lived in that 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.680
 planet and coexisted with humans 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.810
 thanks to these Arcelús pokemon could give 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.910
 life to the pokemon world by going from the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.070
 years the Huns were replaced by 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.140
 other pokemon being so they stayed 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.330
 locked in caves are some exit 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.670
 since the light affected them a short time 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.010
 after the 11 decided to face 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.230
 before the world as you know the 11 are 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.570
 can create life without them to zeus not 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.760
 could have created the world pokemon the 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.800
 legendary dogs king with his cradle and 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.570
 entity and that they defended the cave union 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.910
 they realized that the 11 wanted 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.160
 destroy everything in its path so the three 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.440
 legendary dogs faced each other 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.450
 when they are attached are one 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.760
 able to destroy everything in its path 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.490
 defeating rayco people these are 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.320
 to a pokémon and that was his and kun ones 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.510
 they pursued them endlessly throughout the 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.700
 night when the sun hid its and cune 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.070
 I knew that the 11 was weak in light 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.560
 then when the 11 were around 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.440
 defeat his and kun he overcomes them using 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.330
 as the years go by, the 11 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.610
 they were in the union cave trapped 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.850
 knowing that his son watched over them 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.860
 all this together with raikkonen of good 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.840
 I hope you like it and with this 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.490
 I want to send a big hello to this man 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.920

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.780
 theory very well do not forget to leave your league
