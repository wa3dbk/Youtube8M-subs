know<00:02:11.039> why<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.489> thought<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> would<00:02:11.849> take<00:02:11.970> me

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
know why but I thought it would take me

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.110 
know why but I thought it would take me
a<00:02:12.209> while<00:02:13.019> longer<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.890> didn't<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.790> okay

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
a while longer but it didn't that's okay

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.059 
a while longer but it didn't that's okay
more<00:02:16.110> time<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.319> other<00:02:16.530> projects

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.670 

so<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.150> basically<00:02:20.689> give<00:02:21.109> through<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.439> I<00:02:21.499> either

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
so I basically give through and I either

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.970 
so I basically give through and I either
painted<00:02:22.189> in<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.480> draw<00:02:24.109> it<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.379> I<00:02:24.650> draw<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
painted in or I draw it in I draw the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.369 
painted in or I draw it in I draw the
cells<00:02:25.370> ideal<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.939> shadow<00:02:26.180> shape<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:27.349> to

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
cells ideal the shadow shape I like to

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.649 
cells ideal the shadow shape I like to
work<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.739> triangles<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.700> squares<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.510> my

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
work with triangles and squares and my

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.780 
work with triangles and squares and my
shadows<00:02:30.139> especially<00:02:30.859> like<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.249> the<00:02:31.340> hair<00:02:31.579> and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
shadows especially like in the hair and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.050 
shadows especially like in the hair and
on<00:02:31.909> fabric<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.829> just<00:02:34.159> I<00:02:34.459> don't<00:02:34.939> know

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
on fabric I think it just I don't know

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.470 
on fabric I think it just I don't know
it<00:02:35.269> looks<00:02:35.420> good<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.019> me<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.500> don't<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.480> just

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
it looks good to me I don't know I just

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.220 
it looks good to me I don't know I just
do<00:02:38.840> art<00:02:39.079> I<00:02:39.409> don't<00:02:39.650> know<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.040> looks<00:02:40.340> good

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
do art I don't know it just looks good

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.470 
do art I don't know it just looks good
so<00:02:42.230> here<00:02:42.500> I'm<00:02:42.760> selecting<00:02:43.760> all<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:43.969> warm

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
so here I'm selecting all the warm

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.520 
so here I'm selecting all the warm
colors<00:02:44.719> and<00:02:45.200> i'm<00:02:45.969> using<00:02:46.969> the<00:02:47.239> saturation<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
colors and i'm using the saturation and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.599 
colors and i'm using the saturation and
huge<00:02:48.919> phul<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.459> change<00:02:49.999> the<00:02:50.180> colors<00:02:50.480> around<00:02:50.749> to

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
huge phul to change the colors around to

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.530 
huge phul to change the colors around to
fit<00:02:52.609> a<00:02:52.639> little<00:02:52.969> better

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.780 

so<00:02:56.140> I'm<00:02:56.290> going<00:02:56.590> back<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.219> forth<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.730> I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so I'm going back and forth and I'm

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.209 
so I'm going back and forth and I'm
checking<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.540> make<00:02:58.599> sure<00:02:58.719> everything<00:02:59.349> looks

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219 
checking to make sure everything looks

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.520 
checking to make sure everything looks
pretty<00:03:00.579> good<00:03:00.819> some<00:03:01.180> colors<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:01.629> too<00:03:01.780> dark<00:03:02.079> to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
pretty good some colors are too dark to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.559 
pretty good some colors are too dark to
light<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.069> I'm<00:03:03.129> kind<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.549> adjusting<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
light so I'm kind of like adjusting and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.759 
light so I'm kind of like adjusting and
coloring<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.769> I'm<00:03:06.129> shading<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.760> teeth

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
coloring or I'm shading in the teeth

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.440 
coloring or I'm shading in the teeth
some<00:03:08.769> people<00:03:09.040> tend<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> shade<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.939> teeth<00:03:10.150> with

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
some people tend to shade the teeth with

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.339 
some people tend to shade the teeth with
yellow<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.519> light<00:03:12.760> yellow<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.720> would

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
do that for a more realistic painting or

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.819 
do that for a more realistic painting or
portrait<00:03:17.109> but<00:03:18.329> with<00:03:19.329> cel-shaded<00:03:20.319> characters

even though i know the bones and teeth
are<00:03:41.590> kind<00:03:41.889> of<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.450> marrow<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.540> color<00:03:43.930> still<00:03:44.889> I

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159
