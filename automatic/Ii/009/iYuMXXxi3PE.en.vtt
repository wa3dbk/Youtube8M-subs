00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of my past videos where I had some

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
of my past videos where I had some
really<00:01:18.630> cheap<00:01:18.869> foam<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.799> was<00:01:19.979> closed-cell

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
really cheap foam that was closed-cell

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.530 
really cheap foam that was closed-cell
foam<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.380> stuff<00:01:22.860> isn't<00:01:23.310> rated<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.390> be

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
foam and that stuff isn't rated to be

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
foam and that stuff isn't rated to be
used<00:01:24.780> under<00:01:25.049> water<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.340> poly<00:01:26.670> ether

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
used under water but this poly ether

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
used under water but this poly ether
foam<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.780> definitely<00:01:28.500> rated<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.310> used

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
foam is definitely rated to be used

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
foam is definitely rated to be used
under<00:01:30.030> water<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:31.430> you'll<00:01:32.430> notice<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.320> just

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
under water and you'll notice that just

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.410 
under water and you'll notice that just
by<00:01:34.439> looking<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.310> especially<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:36.060> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
by looking at it and especially if you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
by looking at it and especially if you
look<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> edge<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:38.360> how<00:01:39.360> much

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
look at the edge you can see how much

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
look at the edge you can see how much
air<00:01:39.900> volume<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.950> within<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.880> foam<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.070> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
air volume is within the foam and this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.210 
air volume is within the foam and this
stuff<00:01:44.399> basically<00:01:45.149> lasts<00:01:45.750> forever<00:01:46.220> underwater

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
stuff basically lasts forever underwater

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.460 
stuff basically lasts forever underwater
and<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.060> got<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.630> surface<00:01:49.079> area<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and it's got so much surface area that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.109 
and it's got so much surface area that
it<00:01:49.920> makes<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> perfect<00:01:51.049> aquarium<00:01:52.049> filter<00:01:52.500> pad

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
it makes a perfect aquarium filter pad

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.310 
it makes a perfect aquarium filter pad
you<00:01:54.119> may<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:56.930> canister<00:01:57.930> filter

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you may if you have a canister filter

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.200 
you may if you have a canister filter
notice<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.219> they<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.659> similar

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
notice that they do use similar

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.109 
notice that they do use similar
materials<00:02:03.210> within<00:02:03.600> those<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.909> this<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
materials within those and this is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.580 
materials within those and this is
definitely<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.719> stuff<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> you'd<00:02:07.290> want<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
definitely the stuff that you'd want to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.120 
definitely the stuff that you'd want to
use<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.340> made

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
use if you made

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.720 
use if you made
Matt<00:02:09.490> filter<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.220> same<00:02:12.430> stuff

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
Matt filter and this is the same stuff

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.090 
Matt filter and this is the same stuff
that<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.970> lot<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.300> people<00:02:13.540> use<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:14.320> bubble

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
that a lot of people use for bubble

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.970 
that a lot of people use for bubble
filters<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.630> great<00:02:16.930> stuff<00:02:17.200> you'll<00:02:17.770> see

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
filters so it's great stuff you'll see

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.590 
filters so it's great stuff you'll see
there<00:02:18.160> are<00:02:18.220> different<00:02:18.490> numbers<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:18.850> them

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
there are different numbers on them

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.450 
there are different numbers on them
and<00:02:20.580> that's<00:02:21.580> basically<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.900> PPI<00:02:23.460> rating

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
and that's basically the the PPI rating

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.840 
and that's basically the the PPI rating
for<00:02:25.120> each<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.570> these<00:02:25.660> foams<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.850> that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
for each one of these foams and that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.110 
for each one of these foams and that
stands<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.300> pores<00:02:28.750> per<00:02:29.260> inch<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.730> you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
stands for pores per inch so if you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.680 
stands for pores per inch so if you
start<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.230> T<00:02:32.440> 20<00:02:32.860> or<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.580> PPI<00:02:33.910> 20<00:02:34.510> is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
start here the T 20 or the the PPI 20 is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.290 
start here the T 20 or the the PPI 20 is
20<00:02:35.680> pores<00:02:35.920> per<00:02:36.190> inch<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.790> means<00:02:37.000> they're

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
20 pores per inch that means they're

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.410 
20 pores per inch that means they're
they're<00:02:37.750> fairly<00:02:38.200> large<00:02:38.500> pores<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:40.360> are

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
they're fairly large pores there are

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.440 
they're fairly large pores there are
only<00:02:40.570> 20<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.110> them<00:02:41.260> per<00:02:41.470> inch<00:02:41.710> you<00:02:42.490> start<00:02:43.330> to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
only 20 of them per inch you start to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.010 
only 20 of them per inch you start to
step<00:02:43.720> into<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.830> PPI<00:02:45.190> or<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.240> T<00:02:46.480> 30

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
step into the the PPI or the the T 30

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.220 
step into the the PPI or the the T 30
here<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.730> pore<00:02:48.970> start<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.510> get<00:02:49.660> smaller

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
here and the pore start to get smaller

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.650 
here and the pore start to get smaller
and<00:02:50.410> when<00:02:51.280> they<00:02:51.430> get<00:02:51.580> smaller<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.240> means<00:02:52.300> you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and when they get smaller that means you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.800 
and when they get smaller that means you
have<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.290> them<00:02:53.440> per<00:02:53.740> inch<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.630> can

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
have more of them per inch so you can

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.690 
have more of them per inch so you can
you<00:02:56.350> can<00:02:56.380> start<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.010> see<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.370> difference

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
you can start to see the difference

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.200 
you can start to see the difference
there<00:02:57.970> between<00:02:58.830> between<00:02:59.830> these<00:03:00.130> two<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.640> it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
there between between these two and it

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.630 
there between between these two and it
starts<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.750> really<00:03:01.900> get<00:03:02.200> noticeable<00:03:02.950> when<00:03:03.490> you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
starts to really get noticeable when you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.060 
starts to really get noticeable when you
get<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.390> PPI<00:03:04.690> 40<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.290> you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
get to the the PPI 40 and this is you

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.970 
get to the the PPI 40 and this is you
know<00:03:09.160> pretty<00:03:09.430> dense<00:03:09.820> compared<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.980> compared

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
know pretty dense compared to compared

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.580 
know pretty dense compared to compared
to<00:03:12.010> these<00:03:12.220> two<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:12.760> are<00:03:12.940> fairly<00:03:13.330> open<00:03:13.750> when

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
to these two these are fairly open when

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.290 
to these two these are fairly open when
you<00:03:14.680> when<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.040> touch<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.580> feel<00:03:15.610> these<00:03:16.060> ones

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
you when you touch and feel these ones

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.540 
you when you touch and feel these ones
you<00:03:16.420> can<00:03:16.450> tell<00:03:16.900> how<00:03:17.200> much<00:03:17.320> air<00:03:17.560> volume<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.310> is

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
you can tell how much air volume is is

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.310 
you can tell how much air volume is is
within<00:03:18.820> them<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:19.660> when<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.110> down<00:03:20.260> here

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
within them but when you get down here

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.680 
within them but when you get down here
this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.730> more<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.240> your<00:03:22.420> your

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
this is this is more of like your your

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.960 
this is this is more of like your your
standard<00:03:23.200> foam<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.250> would<00:03:24.520> expect<00:03:24.910> to

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
standard foam that you would expect to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.830 
standard foam that you would expect to
see<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.890> know<00:03:27.010> packaging<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.420> whatnot

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
see in you know packaging and whatnot

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.070 
see in you know packaging and whatnot
like<00:03:29.110> high-end<00:03:30.030> packaging<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.750> stuff<00:03:32.050> that

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
like high-end packaging not stuff that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.720 
like high-end packaging not stuff that
you<00:03:32.260> would<00:03:32.380> throw<00:03:32.590> away<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:33.190> stuff<00:03:33.460> that's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
you would throw away but stuff that's

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.990 
you would throw away but stuff that's
meant<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.120> be<00:03:34.270> used<00:03:35.200> over<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.770> over<00:03:35.890> again<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
meant to be used over and over again and

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.440 
meant to be used over and over again and
then<00:03:37.150> when<00:03:37.300> you<00:03:37.390> get<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> PPI<00:03:38.610> 50<00:03:39.610> that's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
then when you get to the PPI 50 that's

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.890 
then when you get to the PPI 50 that's
really<00:03:41.110> really<00:03:41.410> fun<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:43.180> stuff<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.630> is

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
really really fun and this stuff is is

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.030 
really really fun and this stuff is is
okay<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:45.160> aquarium<00:03:45.970> use<00:03:46.180> but<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
okay for aquarium use but this is the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.360 
okay for aquarium use but this is the
most<00:03:48.340> pores<00:03:48.880> per<00:03:49.180> inch<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.870> would<00:03:50.110> go<00:03:50.370> in

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
most pores per inch that I would go in

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.490 
most pores per inch that I would go in
an<00:03:51.550> aquarium<00:03:51.820> situation<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.020> go<00:03:53.260> any

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
an aquarium situation if you go any

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.700 
an aquarium situation if you go any
higher<00:03:54.210> this<00:03:55.210> is<00:03:55.390> likely<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.930> get<00:03:56.080> clogged<00:03:56.440> up

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
higher this is likely to get clogged up

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.760 
higher this is likely to get clogged up
really<00:03:57.130> fast<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.140> especially<00:03:59.140> if<00:03:59.380> it's<00:03:59.500> used

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
really fast and especially if it's used

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.120 
really fast and especially if it's used
in<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.010> high<00:04:00.220> flow<00:04:00.670> rate<00:04:00.970> situation<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.920> could

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
in a high flow rate situation you could

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.730 
in a high flow rate situation you could
have<00:04:03.370> an<00:04:03.520> overflow<00:04:03.820> or<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:05.080> could<00:04:05.260> have<00:04:05.410> you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
have an overflow or you could have you

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.220 
have an overflow or you could have you
know<00:04:05.800> something<00:04:06.040> clogged<00:04:06.400> up<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.960> burn<00:04:07.960> out

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
know something clogged up and burn out

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.150 
know something clogged up and burn out
because<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:10.020> because<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.500> pores<00:04:11.770> are

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
because of it because the the pores are

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.470 
because of it because the the pores are
so<00:04:12.880> close<00:04:13.180> together<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.640> they<00:04:15.640> tend<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.330> get

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
so close together that they tend to get

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.420 
so close together that they tend to get
clogged<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:17.049> lot<00:04:17.229> faster<00:04:17.739> than<00:04:17.770> something<00:04:18.280> like

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
clogged a lot faster than something like

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.969 
clogged a lot faster than something like

with<00:04:36.500> different<00:04:37.340> additives<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.389> you<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.840> get

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
with different additives and you can get

it free of additives which i believe is
what<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.760> stuff<00:04:43.970> is<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:44.419> but<00:04:45.290> I'm<00:04:45.380> not

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
what this stuff is here but I'm not

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.560 
what this stuff is here but I'm not

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
add like fun fungicide to it so that it

itself and any of that stuff is probably

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.290 
itself and any of that stuff is probably
not<00:05:18.410> aquarium<00:05:19.190> safe<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:19.850> what<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.210> would

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
not aquarium safe so what you would

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.150 
not aquarium safe so what you would
definitely<00:05:20.479> want<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.930> make<00:05:21.050> sure<00:05:21.350> of<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.680> that

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
a factor of how quickly it clogs up so

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
the 20 and the 30 is good for pretty

much any all-purpose aquarium use it's

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.150 
much any all-purpose aquarium use it's
not<00:06:05.780> going<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.139> get<00:06:06.260> clogged<00:06:06.560> up<00:06:06.740> as<00:06:06.950> fast

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
not going to get clogged up as fast

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.490 
not going to get clogged up as fast
there's<00:06:07.880> plenty<00:06:08.300> of<00:06:08.330> surface<00:06:08.630> area<00:06:09.139> there<00:06:09.470> and

you move into like the the PPI 50 it

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.440 
you move into like the the PPI 50 it
might<00:06:15.710> have<00:06:15.919> more<00:06:16.130> surface<00:06:16.669> area<00:06:16.850> than<00:06:17.090> that

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
clogged up faster you're probably not

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.460 
clogged up faster you're probably not

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
going to make much use of that

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.040 
going to make much use of that
additional<00:06:24.710> surface<00:06:25.280> area<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.419> would

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
additional surface area so I would

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.490 
additional surface area so I would
recommend<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:28.370> T<00:06:28.610> 20<00:06:29.000> or<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.210> T<00:06:29.479> 30<00:06:29.840> if<00:06:30.169> you

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
recommend the T 20 or the T 30 if you

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.839 
recommend the T 20 or the T 30 if you
