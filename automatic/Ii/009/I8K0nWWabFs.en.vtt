00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.580
 Future coder 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.490
 Nishihana Shiren 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 It is not such a story 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 Will be to cut the video to Bawakaru so we'll watch that today who see you more than you are 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.450
 A little more but it is the first time Well 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.420
 It's great that this is the top 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:31.000
 Even bonus 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.380
 At the top you are brain-dead in your age 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 It is also my bangs 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.470
 It is an incident 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 It's completely possible to see you here It's here too Hanar 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.690
 I 'm about six years old 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 A and I should try to shorten the hair a little bit today 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 I think there are a lot of people who know my channel who I think 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.899
 But I have never been to a hospital room 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.100
 I'm a one-second student, but I've never been to that booth , even in a beauty school 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.680
 It is a very good example type 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.950
 Well On the other hand hair has come on their own from the time of about hearing fifth grade 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 Is but I have a two roughly divided because how Anne to cut the hair 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.850
 It is a scissor say this is the first one 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.659
 Scissors for cutting this kind of normal hair 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.159
 Say I Another one this is I might be too everyone's do not know 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.390
 I'd to feel you like a 9 c to be those of a laser to the portion of the distal end 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.159
 that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.840
 In this and comes with leaves feel like discouraging the waistcoat Inoki 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.509
 In the direction of changing the hair length 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 Use of is is by far the easier of here I'd say even 4 servings You of the laser this time 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.360
 So I will use this laser this time 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.370
 It is normal to 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:55.460
 Because lasers such as made of plastic say this also to 100 Toka average has sold 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:59.960
 Turn off all means that the arm hair because Well there are things that I blade will cut is not easily paper with 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.240
 There is a thing called leather at all even if you think that it is likely to see it, so this is here 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.650
 The try to use I think it may be appreciated 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.910
 This video is a tutorial video I think I'm going to cut off just a little 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.390
 Like 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.160
 I explained that-me 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.390
 In that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 It is not in the video I say get to try I think you will like this way 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.070
 Well Anotada as copper usually that horse because I had happened to think that I should to cut the time or date 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.360
 That's why I'm cutting my hair 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.270
 What does it mean? 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.780
 It's a long- running video, so it's a kind of video that you think you should watch 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.990
 I am 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:43.060
 That I alter ego also I'll be concentrated over here because they bought their own God 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.380
 Please note that I am not particularly responsible for anything, but I feel like this 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.950
 If there is a person who has a temporary sleep 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.010
 I think that you should think 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.340
 So first of all this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.060
 Helplessly long 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.030
 It is the top 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.790
 I have a feeling that I'm not getting into the corner now 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.790
 Well I think I should try to lightly top 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.010
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.670
 I do not fit with the spin 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.810
 Normally 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.620
 Than a such example is when can really leather 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 Well yourself 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.450
 Ask them carried out by the edges of the leather at the length Tteyuu I wish I want to do is 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.710
 Well I feel like Somu 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.660
 The cutline of the child feels more natural than a scissor 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.970
 Even the white one 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.330
 I think it's easy to wear 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.960
 I usually do evo completely with dry cut 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.390
 It does not matter if it is above , but just doing it alone 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.090
 It is troubled, or it is something that this paper is attached to 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.260
 So I usually 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.710
 I'm also wearing the above clothes but 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.420
 Because it is the animation which goes to youtube today 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.420
 I am getting dressed today 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.350
 Basically, you just have to do what you want 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.430
 Well pull out the whole panel 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.430
 I think I will cut long places 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 truly 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:28.030
 As it feels like an interval, regarding the length 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.030
 I think that I am used to it I think at first I might have failed for a while 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:41.229
 This was my first time to cut my hair by myself in the fifth grade of elementary school until then 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.229
 But my uncle I have dexterity wins 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.790
 I I had been asked to come all the way to 5 people 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.910
 But after all that 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:56.580
 There is death, so that use is not 's hairdresser 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.400
 Feeling so much fashionable because the guy of those who are around Kano round and round and red Toka blue Toka white 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.680
 It wasn't just like it would be shortened 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.139
 I don't really like it anymore 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.880
 I didn't want to hate it 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.240
 a 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.750
 I thought it would be early if I had already cut it myself 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.990
 Just my sister too 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.729
 Because there was that or a part-time job in this industry 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.490
 While being taught a little 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:29.470
 After all, surely I feel say standing start off on their own 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:34.539
 Gaee to say 100% of the hairstyle you want to be yourself is not it known only to yourself 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.440
 If you get someone else's valley, you will not be 100% of what you want to do 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.110
 Is not there 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.910
 It's a bit unconvincing 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:47.370
 Did you allow yourself 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.370
 It is such a mon, Top has become a little short 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.479
 Ah 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.479
 It is a little long one 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.930
 Isn't it like this? 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.169
 I think I do not know if it is not set, but this is set 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.300
 I'm sorry 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.409
 Ummm 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.409
 Is it the difference in length? 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.930
 I think that such a part will be understood 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.060
 I will go around a few turns next time 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.610
 If the turnaround is too long 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.599
 Weight is 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.599
 I'm going out with Ghan 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.950
 I want to 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.960
 I am not completely silent though 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.230
 Hey, it looks like Is 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.020
 I want to cut bang forever 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:03.370
 I think it's okay to look at the monitor if it is about bang 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.370
 I guess let's come over here 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.830
 For now we are 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.220
 For now this always divided Terutoko 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.370
 Put it in place 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.400
 This is the original bangs of the blow 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.300
 Because there are many people who are dark m 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.300
 Know this 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:33.729
 I guess that's probably another thing 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:33.729
 I think that want to go 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.910
 me 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:48.749
 me
