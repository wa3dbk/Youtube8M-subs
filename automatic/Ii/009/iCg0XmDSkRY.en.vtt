worldcom and I was recently introduced

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.450 
worldcom and I was recently introduced
to<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> new<00:00:08.280> software<00:00:08.639> called<00:00:08.940> DVD<00:00:09.900> Ranger<00:00:10.460> and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
to a new software called DVD Ranger and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.539 
to a new software called DVD Ranger and
I<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:11.820> wanted<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> go<00:00:12.269> over<00:00:13.190> real<00:00:14.190> briefly

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
I just wanted to go over real briefly

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.700 
I just wanted to go over real briefly
exactly<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.780> software<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> what

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
exactly what this software is and what

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.820 
exactly what this software is and what
makes<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> different<00:00:18.680> compared<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> other

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
makes it different compared to other

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.870 
makes it different compared to other
software<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.300> type<00:00:22.699> from<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
software of this type from what I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.170 
software of this type from what I
understand<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.990> development<00:00:25.859> team<00:00:26.039> has<00:00:26.880> been

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
understand the development team has been

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
understand the development team has been
around<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.689> least<00:00:27.750> 10<00:00:28.230> years<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.769> they've

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
around for at least 10 years so they've

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.420 
around for at least 10 years so they've
been<00:00:29.189> working<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.920> type<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.099> software

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
been working on this type of software

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.290 
been working on this type of software
for<00:00:32.730> quite<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> while<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.460> they<00:00:35.460> were

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
for quite a while and they were

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.750 
for quite a while and they were
originally<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.140> developers<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.370> software

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
originally the developers for a software

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.760 
originally the developers for a software
called<00:00:38.850> DVD<00:00:39.329> next<00:00:39.629> copy<00:00:39.960> which<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:42.649> if<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
called DVD next copy which was the if I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
called DVD next copy which was the if I
remember<00:00:44.129> correctly<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.879> successor

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
remember correctly it was the successor

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
remember correctly it was the successor
to<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.730> software<00:00:47.730> called<00:00:48.230> DVD<00:00:49.230> X<00:00:49.469> copy<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to a software called DVD X copy if you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.930 
to a software called DVD X copy if you
remember<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.930> 10<00:00:52.289> years<00:00:52.410> ago

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
remember that from about 10 years ago

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
remember that from about 10 years ago
that's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.480> caused<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> big<00:00:55.800> scene

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that's the one that caused a big scene

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.970 
that's the one that caused a big scene
with<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.910> movie<00:00:57.480> studios<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> copying<00:00:58.590> DVDs

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
with the movie studios and copying DVDs

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
with the movie studios and copying DVDs
and<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.030> basically<00:01:00.359> what

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and all that it's basically what

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.140 
and all that it's basically what
launched<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.199> entire<00:01:03.080> line<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.290> software

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
launched this entire line of software

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.780 
launched this entire line of software
that's<00:01:06.150> still<00:01:06.450> around<00:01:06.659> today<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.369> DVD<00:01:08.369> Ranger

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that's still around today so DVD Ranger

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's still around today so DVD Ranger
kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> takes<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.689> next<00:01:10.170> level<00:01:10.700> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
kind of takes it to the next level and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
kind of takes it to the next level and
I'm<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.270> their<00:01:12.420> site<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I'm on their site here and it kind of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.020 
I'm on their site here and it kind of
goes<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:16.070> exactly<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
goes over exactly what it is

one nice thing to have about it is a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.440 
one nice thing to have about it is a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's lightweight similar to VLC player
now<00:01:36.840> here's<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.200> example<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.570 

there's<00:01:44.590> nothing<00:01:44.920> fancy<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.370> it<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.550> just

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
there's nothing fancy to it it just

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.000 
there's nothing fancy to it it just
basically<00:01:45.910> plays<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.810> video<00:01:47.230> files<00:01:47.620> that<00:01:47.800> you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
basically plays the video files that you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.480 
basically plays the video files that you
want<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.390> nice<00:01:50.250> compact<00:01:51.250> viewing<00:01:52.000> area<00:01:52.410> okay

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
want in a nice compact viewing area okay

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.380 
want in a nice compact viewing area okay
other<00:01:54.490> than<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:55.530> they've<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:57.390> included

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
other than that they've just included

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.140 
other than that they've just included
blu-ray<00:01:58.780> transcoding<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.490> basically<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:00.970> can

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
blu-ray transcoding so basically you can

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.080 
blu-ray transcoding so basically you can
rip<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.570> copy<00:02:01.750> blu-ray<00:02:02.260> movies<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.090> either
