 percent 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.720
 Mix 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.550
 this indistinct way 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.370
 totally fantastic images 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.340
 it is the product of the imagination co 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 real world elements 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.749
 how long can it take you 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.280
 there are a couple of examples this aser an investment trade

 honor cadet in a stretch like 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.450
 it costs me a lot or quite ample that in per place 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.929
 To several people 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.639
 always try an example that to be 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.279
 a 10-second commercial with a team of five people

 it was third place 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.840
 what stimulates the investment a place where responds was taken in the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.000
 credibility places in the studies for example of pixar forgot gidus or 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.739
 either the big ones 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.839
 they are places 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.599
 that look like ramis seem 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.199
 the game site 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.559

 now in new colastiné as it has been passed to the computer 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:34.829
 I hope it is but having a PC this you can apply these techniques without having

 this study more 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.400
 in the survey there are many applications there are even calculation that are free 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.340
 of license in the USA the license as the one and is not totally free for

 the learning and honest way in a barbarian 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.130
 what leaves everyone behind is not that it says that the 40 person tray does not 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.919

 the post can do 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.969
 in a wonderful world like this one having fun 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.150
 as for the first
