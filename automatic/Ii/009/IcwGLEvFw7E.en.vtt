00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
so we can straighten out our trajectory

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.530 
so we can straighten out our trajectory
and<00:01:45.160> then<00:01:45.820> we're<00:01:45.910> gonna<00:01:46.000> straighten<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.450> out

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
and then we're gonna straighten it out

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.910 
and then we're gonna straighten it out
we're<00:01:46.840> gonna<00:01:46.900> go<00:01:47.080> back<00:01:47.230> level<00:01:47.560> there<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:47.770> go

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
we're gonna go back level there you go

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.060 
we're gonna go back level there you go
and<00:01:48.190> just<00:01:48.730> manage<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.330> go<00:01:49.450> straight<00:01:49.980> so<00:01:50.980> if

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
and just manage it to go straight so if

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.230 
and just manage it to go straight so if
you<00:01:51.190> see<00:01:51.370> it<00:01:51.460> going<00:01:51.610> one<00:01:51.850> way<00:01:51.880> or<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.210> other

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
flying is remember the wind wind

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.740 
flying is remember the wind wind
conditions<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.490> also<00:04:32.699> alter<00:04:33.120> your<00:04:33.270> flight

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
at this point right now this plane is

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.939 
at this point right now this plane is
fully<00:04:39.449> trimmed<00:04:39.780> out<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.379> not<00:04:40.590> touching
