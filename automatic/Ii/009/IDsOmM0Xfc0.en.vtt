00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello with you again max and in this video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.770
 I would like to share with you about what 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 I chose the sports nutrition for myself 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.109
 I want to immediately say that before this 4 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 half a year of training in the gym 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.170
 I never took sports nutrition and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.019
 right now when the moment came and when 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.469
 there is a desire for more achievements 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.469
 great results I came to the fact that 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 need to seek help from 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.739
 sports nutrition and go straight to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.140
 to business 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.829
 1 acre was the first thing I didnâ€™t think about 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 to choose for themselves so that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.129
 best suited to my goals 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.350
 my goals are to maximize 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.320
 visual as a visual muscle growth 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.500
 not even the masses like this so that I weigh there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.990
 90 100 kilogram yes I can even 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 look better on and i can look 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 more visually than there we say 90 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.840
 pound and yes there is Barney at least you 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.860
 not there 80 will i exactly seek 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.159
 visually maximum muscle volume 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.990
 so long thinking and thinking first 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.689
 what I stopped at is amino acids bc 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.299
 a64 machine tools 175 tablets chose this 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.579
 go grandma for sale 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.570
 I chose the company with this nutrition 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.240
 I know it is good or bad, I just 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.430
 even kind of chose for myself 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.030
 such pills 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 amino acids they province of the blend and 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 such here if you can see enough 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.960
 big 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.829
 I'll tell you right away why I chose 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.930
 amino acids 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.689
 firstly they prevent it 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.009
 complete muscle that is mycel 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.280
 non catholic process of muscles and skin 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.200
 card is a logical process in the muscles this is something 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.970
 that the muscles during the workout concluded that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.180
 begin the very destruction of the muscles so 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.160
 to prevent this process i 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.920
 I accept amino acids 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.310
 I take 3 pills before training 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.860
 when I undress changing clothes 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.319
 dressing room and when I train I go in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.110
 in the locker room in the bank I deserve 3 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.720
 pills and drink and the next day 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.530
 when i wake up i also drink three 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 pills and precisely amino acids help 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.010
 me save 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.230
 muscles and also gain - 1 cirrhosis give 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.049
 I even do not have the muscles, you can not say 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.260
 muscle mass and just give muscle growth 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.870
 exactly amino acids 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.500
 I chose the next idiot 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.989
 cretin 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.640
 biotech company do not know good or 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.840
 bad 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.450
 write in the comments what you think 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.380
 about this for this for this company 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.390
 and 300 grams 100 percent creatine 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.940
 monohydrate on here it goes 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.850
 powder 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 I accept it without the loading phase 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.530
 there have snacks you can phase it 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.200
 loading and without spare wheel I accept without 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.550
 firstly to save product during 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.150
 secondly, the consideration is that the results 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.650
 will be the same as the boot phase 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.290
 just the boot phase is done in order 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.030
 to achieve faster results and without 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.490
 loads and results will be the same 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.700
 but after a longer time span 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.510
 so I accept the rating right away 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.180
 after training along with amino acids 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.430
 drink amino acids and cretin and also 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.520
 the next day i wake up drink 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.720
 amino acid drink tablets and drink 5 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.550
 gram creatine creatine what gives me it 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.900
 gives me strength he gives me stamina 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.300
 according to this i can more 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.100
 I can train hard in the gym 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.610
 to train him in the hall more weight 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.940
 female 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.310
 and according to this goes more 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.799
 load on the muscles and they are better 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.169
 wiggles and with this with increasing 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.780
 load load on muscles muscles grow 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.030
 from this therefore since my goal 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.640
 increase strength increase the load on 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.300
 muscle and increase muscle volumes 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.070
 I took amino acids in order to muscle 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.690
 not the most destroyed and took 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.020
 pleasant to increase your 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.700
 forces and thereby increase the load on 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.919
 muscles 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:56.919
 here and since I believe that my goals and 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.419
 The means for this coincide gives strength and 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:05.230
 to give the amino acids do not give 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.590
 muscles to break me very important then 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.969
 What do you think about this? 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.279
 what combination with such 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.279
