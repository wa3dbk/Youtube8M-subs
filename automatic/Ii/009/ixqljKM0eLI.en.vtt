00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.710 
fine details you can go check that out
and<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.129> know<00:00:49.640> sit<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.090> compare<00:00:50.480> them

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
and you know sit and compare them

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.810

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
exactly but you'll see that they are

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.479

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
quite different on the glam glow has a

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.119 
quite different on the glam glow has a
bunch<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.239> exfoliating<00:00:56.989> acids<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.650> it<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.010> it

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
bunch of exfoliating acids in it so it

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.000 
bunch of exfoliating acids in it so it
has<00:00:58.309> like<00:00:58.460> lactic<00:00:58.910> acid<00:00:59.390> salicylic<00:01:00.080> acid

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
has like lactic acid salicylic acid

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.760 
has like lactic acid salicylic acid
glycolic<00:01:01.309> acid<00:01:02.239> whereas<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.500> more<00:01:03.680> of

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
glycolic acid whereas this the more of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.439 
glycolic acid whereas this the more of
it<00:01:03.890> someone<00:01:04.190> doesn't<00:01:04.640> have<00:01:04.850> all<00:01:05.210> those<00:01:05.390> things

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
it someone doesn't have all those things

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.780 
it someone doesn't have all those things
it<00:01:06.170> does<00:01:06.380> have<00:01:06.590> some<00:01:06.770> fruit<00:01:07.040> extracts<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
it does have some fruit extracts and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670 
it does have some fruit extracts and
things<00:01:08.000> which<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:08.420> does<00:01:08.690> as<00:01:08.899> well<00:01:09.110> but

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
things which this does as well but

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.440 
things which this does as well but
they're<00:01:09.950> different<00:01:10.369> in<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.729> way<00:01:11.090> definitely

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
they're different in that way definitely

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.150 
they're different in that way definitely
so<00:01:12.170> I'm<00:01:12.259> gonna<00:01:12.380> talk<00:01:12.619> about<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.890> little<00:01:13.009> bit

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
really love there's the black one I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.810 
really love there's the black one I
actually<00:01:24.229> didn't<00:01:24.860> like<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.250> tried<00:01:25.640> that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
actually didn't like that I tried that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.870 
actually didn't like that I tried that
as<00:01:26.000> well<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:27.009> don't<00:01:28.009> think<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.460> worked<00:01:28.670> as

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
as well and I don't think it worked as

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.029 
as well and I don't think it worked as
well<00:01:29.270> as<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.690> does<00:01:30.020> first<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.740> all<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.979> don't

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
well as this does first of all I don't

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.760 
well as this does first of all I don't
like<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.460> texture<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.140> black<00:01:33.439> one

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
like the texture of it the black one

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.820 
like the texture of it the black one
literally<00:01:34.340> feels<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.180> you're<00:01:35.330> putting<00:01:35.830> tree

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
literally feels like you're putting tree

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.800 
literally feels like you're putting tree
branches<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.369> twigs<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.150> face<00:01:38.450> it's

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
branches and twigs on your face it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.560 
branches and twigs on your face it's
like<00:01:38.990> stuff<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.189> massive<00:01:40.729> chunks<00:01:41.390> like

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
like stuff is in massive chunks like

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.390 
like stuff is in massive chunks like
there's<00:01:41.810> leaves<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.500> twigs<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.040> they<00:01:43.220> just

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
there's leaves and twigs and they just

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.670 
there's leaves and twigs and they just
fall<00:01:43.700> off<00:01:43.850> your<00:01:44.090> face<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.350> makes<00:01:45.470> an

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
fall off your face and it just makes an

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.910 
fall off your face and it just makes an
absolute<00:01:45.890> stinking<00:01:46.700> mess<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.900> didn't<00:01:48.770> like

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
absolute stinking mess and I didn't like

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.830 
absolute stinking mess and I didn't like
that<00:01:48.950> at<00:01:49.280> all<00:01:49.460> basically<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.390> comes<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.750> two

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
that at all basically it comes in two

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.539 
that at all basically it comes in two
pods<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.259> feels<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.650> aluminium<00:01:52.220> it's<00:01:52.430> not

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
pods it feels like aluminium it's not

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.940

things<00:03:02.489> before<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.420> they<00:03:04.319> hadn't<00:03:04.680> worked<00:03:04.800> for

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
things before and they hadn't worked for

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.949 
things before and they hadn't worked for
me<00:03:05.250> but<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.459> hadn't<00:03:05.850> tried<00:03:06.030> gland<00:03:06.390> glow<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:06.870> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
me but I hadn't tried gland glow so I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.900 
me but I hadn't tried gland glow so I
did<00:03:07.140> end<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.410> trying<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.640> works

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
did end up trying it and it works

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.930 
did end up trying it and it works
beautifully<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.920> put<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.400> layer<00:03:11.640> all

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
beautifully I just put it a layer all

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.809 
beautifully I just put it a layer all
over<00:03:11.970> my<00:03:12.330> face<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.430> leave<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.760> for

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
over my face I like to leave it on for

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.009 
over my face I like to leave it on for
20<00:03:15.150> minutes<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.709> dries<00:03:17.660> really<00:03:18.660> really

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
20 minutes and it dries really really

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.590 
20 minutes and it dries really really
hard<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.860> skin<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.910> that's<00:03:21.329> one

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
hard on the skin so that's one

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.770 
hard on the skin so that's one
difference<00:03:21.709> between<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.160> glam<00:03:23.970> glow<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.570> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
difference between the glam glow and the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.640 
difference between the glam glow and the
more<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.110> its<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.380> bit<00:03:25.560> more<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.829> its<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.820> retain

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
more of its a bit more of its you retain

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.100 
more of its a bit more of its you retain
the<00:03:28.650> ability<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.370> move<00:03:29.820> your<00:03:29.880> face<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.750> mean<00:03:30.930> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
the ability to move your face I mean it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.860 
the ability to move your face I mean it
does<00:03:31.350> feel<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.519> tight<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.150> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
does feel a little bit tight but it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.530 
does feel a little bit tight but it
doesn't<00:03:34.290> dry<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.160> way<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.940> does<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.480> is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
doesn't dry the way this does this is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.720 
doesn't dry the way this does this is
just<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.320> stiff<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.310> can't<00:03:38.579> even

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
just really stiff like you can't even

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.640 
just really stiff like you can't even
talk<00:03:39.120> by<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.570> end<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.079> you're<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.260> kind

talk by the end of it you're just kind
of<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.070> can't<00:03:41.430> say<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> word<00:03:42.109> it's<00:03:43.109> just

color almost it goes on black and then
dry<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.380> great<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.030> weird

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
