00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.600 
well there's a new particle system
there's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> new<00:01:15.210> car<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.840> muscle<00:01:16.140> car<00:01:16.610> for

there's a new car the muscle car for
those<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> us<00:01:18.000> who<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> retro

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
those of us who have sort of a retro

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
those of us who have sort of a retro
fondness<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.649> muscle<00:01:19.950> cars<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.520> brought<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
fondness for muscle cars we brought in a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.870 
fondness for muscle cars we brought in a
bunch<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.240> xbox<00:01:21.600> 360<00:01:22.229> gamers<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.729> them

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bunch of xbox 360 gamers to have them

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.609 
bunch of xbox 360 gamers to have them
sort<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.119> review<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> control<00:01:25.020> layout<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
sort of review the control layout I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.760 
sort of review the control layout I
think<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:27.479> basically<00:01:28.140> reflects<00:01:28.560> what

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
think that it's basically reflects what

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.100 
think that it's basically reflects what
they'd<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.659> out<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> console<00:01:33.110> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
they'd like to see out of a console so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.940 
they'd like to see out of a console so
there<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.289> nine<00:01:34.409> character<00:01:34.740> classes

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there are nine character classes

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
there are nine character classes
basically<00:01:35.550> what<00:01:35.729> we're<00:01:35.880> looking<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
basically what we're looking to do is to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.930 
basically what we're looking to do is to
accommodate<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> wide<00:01:37.890> variety<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.429> play<00:01:38.640> style

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
accommodate a wide variety of play style

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.270 
accommodate a wide variety of play style
so<00:01:39.149> somebody<00:01:39.450> who<00:01:39.569> likes<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.929> play<00:01:40.220> as<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so somebody who likes to play as a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.950 
so somebody who likes to play as a
sniper<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.600> differently

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
sniper is going to play very differently

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
sniper is going to play very differently
than<00:01:43.170> somebody's<00:01:43.500> playing<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> medic<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.580> as

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
than somebody's playing as a medic or as

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
than somebody's playing as a medic or as
a<00:01:45.479> spy<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.710> looked<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.130> were<00:01:47.340> those

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a spy so what we looked at were those

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149 
a spy so what we looked at were those
different<00:01:48.240> kinds<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> player<00:01:49.560> types<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
different kinds of player types and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.590 
different kinds of player types and
tried<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.610> sure<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> type

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
tried to make sure that there was a type

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.620 
tried to make sure that there was a type
for<00:01:51.840> each<00:01:51.869> different<00:01:52.140> person<00:01:52.679> so<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.630> art

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
for each different person so the art

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.029 
for each different person so the art
direction<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> choices<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.740> made<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
direction and the choices we made that

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.039 
direction and the choices we made that
were<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.429> driven<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.450> gameplay

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
were really driven out of the gameplay

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.800 
were really driven out of the gameplay
so<00:01:58.679> for<00:01:58.830> example<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.850> had<00:01:59.970> stuck<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.299> sort

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so for example if we had stuck with sort

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.969 
so for example if we had stuck with sort
of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> hyper<00:02:01.170> realistic<00:02:01.440> style

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of the hyper realistic style

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
of the hyper realistic style
counter-strike<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.240> makes<00:02:03.420> readability<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
counter-strike it makes readability of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.199 
counter-strike it makes readability of
classes<00:02:04.679> much<00:02:04.890> more<00:02:05.099> difficult<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.060> by

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
classes much more difficult but by

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.320 
classes much more difficult but by
moving<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:07.679> more<00:02:07.830> stylized<00:02:08.310> approach<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
moving to more stylized approach you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.910 
moving to more stylized approach you
know<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> being<00:02:09.959> able<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:10.739> on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
know and being able to take on

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
know and being able to take on
non-realistic<00:02:11.790> dimensions<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
non-realistic dimensions for the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.479 
non-realistic dimensions for the
characters<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.470> makes<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.920> readability<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
characters that makes the readability of

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.970 
characters that makes the readability of
those<00:02:14.970> silhouettes<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.690> lot<00:02:16.319> greater<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.890> you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
those silhouettes a lot greater so you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
those silhouettes a lot greater so you
can<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:18.060> easy<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.720> tell<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
can it's it's easy to tell the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
can it's it's easy to tell the
difference<00:02:19.019> between<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.620> heavy<00:02:19.860> weapons<00:02:20.280> guy

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
difference between a heavy weapons guy

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.690 
difference between a heavy weapons guy
and<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:21.180> spy<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.739> critical<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.370> such

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and a spy and that is critical to such

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.759 
and a spy and that is critical to such
of<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.000> tactics<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.690> choices<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.560> make

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
of the tactics and choices that you make

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
of the tactics and choices that you make
when<00:02:25.920> you're<00:02:26.040> playing<00:02:26.250> against<00:02:26.730> them<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.060> team

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
when you're playing against them so team

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.190 
when you're playing against them so team
fortress<00:02:27.690> 2<00:02:27.840> will<00:02:27.989> ship<00:02:28.200> with<00:02:28.379> six<00:02:28.650> levels

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
fortress 2 will ship with six levels

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800 
fortress 2 will ship with six levels
and<00:02:30.530> then<00:02:31.250> we'll<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.910> adding<00:02:32.030> new<00:02:32.300> levels<00:02:32.629> over

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and then we'll be adding new levels over

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.949 
and then we'll be adding new levels over

portal<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.050> one<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.349> really<00:02:48.470> gets<00:02:48.709> me

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
portal is the one that really gets me

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.979 
portal is the one that really gets me
going<00:02:48.950> because<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:50.269> such<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> different<00:02:50.750> way

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
going because it's such a different way

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.890 
going because it's such a different way
of<00:02:51.019> experiencing<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.010> world<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:53.090> seems<00:02:53.420> it
