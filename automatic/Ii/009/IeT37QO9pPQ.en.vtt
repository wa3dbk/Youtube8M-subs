what you think you see when we did our

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.890 
what you think you see when we did our
bag<00:00:13.920> drawings<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> day<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.690> had<00:00:15.870> a

I'm<00:00:18.779> not<00:00:19.220> coming<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.340> uses<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I'm not coming down uses the way that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
I'm not coming down uses the way that
you<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:21.990> were<00:00:22.470> thinking<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.890> were

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you that you were thinking you were

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.150 
you that you were thinking you were
thinking<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.400> left<00:00:23.670> brain<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
thinking with your left brain and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.620 
thinking with your left brain and
instead<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.250> drawing<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.640> phone<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> saw

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
instead of drawing a phone that you saw

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.429 
instead of drawing a phone that you saw
like<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.170> you're<00:00:28.890> drawing<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
like this you're drawing it like this

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.389 
like this you're drawing it like this
that<00:00:31.439> makes<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.859> drawing<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that makes it your drawing what you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
that makes it your drawing what you
thought<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.930> wanted<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
thought was there what you wanted to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.180 
thought was there what you wanted to
perceive<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> were<00:00:35.070> actually

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
perceive not what you were actually

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.430 
perceive not what you were actually
looking<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.630> we're<00:00:36.809> gonna<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.020> working<00:00:37.170> on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
looking at but we're gonna be working on

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
looking at but we're gonna be working on
is<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> right<00:00:37.920> side<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> brain<00:00:38.430> drawing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is the right side of the brain drawing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.740 
is the right side of the brain drawing
what<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.480> actually<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:43.920> blind<00:00:44.460> contour

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
what you actually see so a blind contour

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
what you actually see so a blind contour
we're<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> draw<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.230> hand<00:00:47.270> you're

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we're going to draw our hand you're

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.590 
we're going to draw our hand you're
going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> draw<00:00:49.219> what<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.300> for

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going to draw what you see so for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
going to draw what you see so for
example<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> draw<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
example right here I'm going to draw my

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.459 
example right here I'm going to draw my
thumb<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.949> then<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.670> finger<00:00:57.469> okay

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
thumb and then up to my finger okay

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
thumb and then up to my finger okay
we're<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.120> one-minute

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
we're going to do it in a one-minute

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.579 
we're going to do it in a one-minute
increment<00:01:02.510> but<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:03.930> i'm<00:01:04.049> looking<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.409> my

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
increment but when i'm looking at my

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.880 
increment but when i'm looking at my
hand<00:01:05.450> i'm<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.689> drawing<00:01:06.960> where<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> think<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.650> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
hand i'm not drawing where I think I see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
hand i'm not drawing where I think I see
which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> thumb<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
which is I see a thumb so I'm going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
which is I see a thumb so I'm going to
draw<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:11.840> thumb<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.890> finger<00:01:14.960> okay<00:01:15.960> can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
draw a thumb and then a finger okay can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
draw a thumb and then a finger okay can
you<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.909> too<00:01:17.909> light<00:01:23.930> thumb<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.790> then<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you see that too light thumb and then a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.219 
you see that too light thumb and then a
finger<00:01:27.259> okay<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.640> see

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
finger okay that's what I think I see

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.910 
finger okay that's what I think I see
what<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> actually<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:34.409> knuckle

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
what I actually see is this knuckle

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.850 
what I actually see is this knuckle
right<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.200> creases<00:01:37.710> up

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
right here and then there's creases up

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.460 
right here and then there's creases up
here<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> knuckle<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.350> up

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
here in this knuckle and when I get up

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
here in this knuckle and when I get up
here<00:01:40.740> there's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> thumbnail<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.530> I'm

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
here there's a thumbnail right so if I'm

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
here there's a thumbnail right so if I'm
going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> draw<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.189> enough<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> show<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
going to draw this enough to show the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.260 
going to draw this enough to show the
thumbnail<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.740> come<00:01:46.950> back<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
thumbnail and then I come back and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
thumbnail and then I come back and
connect<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.470> other<00:01:49.680> thing<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.040> drawing

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
connect it the other thing about drawing

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.560 
connect it the other thing about drawing
a<00:01:50.820> contour<00:01:51.360> line<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.490> your<00:01:53.490> pencil<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.299> pen

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
a contour line is your pencil your pen

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
a contour line is your pencil your pen
whatever<00:01:54.930> you're<00:01:55.110> using<00:01:55.140> doesn't<00:01:56.009> leave<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
whatever you're using doesn't leave the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.990 
whatever you're using doesn't leave the
paper<00:01:57.200> okay<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.340> those<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.790> have

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
paper okay so for those of you that have

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
paper okay so for those of you that have
this<00:02:00.149> tendency<00:02:00.390> which<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.049> definitely<00:02:01.469> do<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this tendency which I definitely do so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.679 
this tendency which I definitely do so
it's<00:02:02.579> hard<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.210> away<00:02:03.270> from<00:02:03.450> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it's hard for me to get away from this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's hard for me to get away from this
you're<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.619> drawing<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:08.270> trying<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you're not drawing like this trying to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
you're not drawing like this trying to
sketch<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.750> whatever<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.229> drawing<00:02:10.530> it's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
sketch out whatever your drawing it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.340 
sketch out whatever your drawing it's
one<00:02:11.610> continuous<00:02:11.640> line

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
one continuous line
