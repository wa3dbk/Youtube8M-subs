leather<00:00:07.109> case<00:00:07.440> from<00:00:07.680> Zeena's<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.400> I'll<00:00:08.460> just

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
leather case from Zeena's so I'll just

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.709 
leather case from Zeena's so I'll just
give<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.820> quick<00:00:09.030> look<00:00:09.179> around<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.510> case

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
give you a quick look around the case

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.039 
give you a quick look around the case
before<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.990> pop<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.260> phone<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:11.570> it's<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.750> here

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
before I pop the phone in it's on here

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.259 
before I pop the phone in it's on here
we've<00:00:13.200> got<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> pattern<00:00:14.250> that's<00:00:14.429> obvious

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
we've got the pattern that's obvious

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.529 
we've got the pattern that's obvious
where<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> phone<00:00:15.750> fits<00:00:16.049> itself<00:00:17.150> this<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.210> pop

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
where the phone fits itself this is pop

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.019 
where the phone fits itself this is pop
so<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.109> either<00:00:19.619> put<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.160> credit<00:00:20.640> card

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
so you can either put a credit card

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.660 
so you can either put a credit card
debit<00:00:21.330> card<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> year<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> note<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:23.430> kind

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
debit card or a year a note of some kind

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
debit card or a year a note of some kind
in<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.060> you've<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> slot<00:00:25.260> down

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
in there you've also got a slot down

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.810 
in there you've also got a slot down
here<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.830> that's<00:00:25.980> probably<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.400> bad<00:00:26.550> for

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
here so that's probably gonna be bad for

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.390 
here so that's probably gonna be bad for
a<00:00:26.849> row<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.180> putting<00:00:27.480> money<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.160> just<00:00:29.160> give<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
a row for putting money in just give you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
a row for putting money in just give you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
a quick look at this probably easy to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
a quick look at this probably easy to
show<00:00:30.869> from<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> back<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:32.219> yes

fine<00:00:33.420> cause<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> stop<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
fine cause on there so just to stop it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
fine cause on there so just to stop it
sort<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> dust<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.170> your

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.060 

and<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.650> you've<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.950> access

will fit in there no problem lightning
connector<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.250> on

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
connector and so on

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.899 
connector and so on
so<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.840> close<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.110> case<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.850> was

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so if we just close the case so as I was

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
so if we just close the case so as I was
saying<00:01:20.970> before<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.259> closure

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
saying before this is the the closure

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
saying before this is the the closure
system<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.490> magnetized<00:01:24.030> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
system and it's actually magnetized so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
system and it's actually magnetized so
it<00:01:24.420> closes<00:01:24.810> nice<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.229> easily<00:01:25.350> holds<00:01:26.340> together

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it closes nice and easily holds together

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.760 
it closes nice and easily holds together
firm<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> while

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
firm you can actually use this while

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
firm you can actually use this while
you're<00:01:29.040> while<00:01:29.460> you're<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> phone<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.570> if

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you're while you're on the phone so if

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.510 
you're while you're on the phone so if

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you answer the phone and then close the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
you answer the phone and then close the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
on the front they could've done with

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
on the front they could've done with
making<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> strap<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.799> higher

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
