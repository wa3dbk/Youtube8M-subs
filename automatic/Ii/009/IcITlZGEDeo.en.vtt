00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
software and you're good to go so let's

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
software and you're good to go so let's
do<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> quick<00:00:55.199> demo<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
do a quick demo and see how well this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.420 
do a quick demo and see how well this
harddrive<00:00:57.120> functions<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.250> up

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
harddrive functions so first take up

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.420 
harddrive functions so first take up
take<00:00:59.760> our<00:00:59.940> PC<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> yoga<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
take our PC here this is the yoga and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.929 
take our PC here this is the yoga and
connected<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> USB<00:01:05.909> 3.0<00:01:06.299> port<00:01:10.640> let's<00:01:11.640> sign

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
connected to the USB 3.0 port let's sign

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.920 
connected to the USB 3.0 port let's sign
in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.980 

and<00:01:17.020> we<00:01:17.860> should<00:01:18.100> have<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.670> hard<00:01:19.060> drive<00:01:19.210> showing

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
and we should have a hard drive showing

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.440 
and we should have a hard drive showing
up<00:01:20.140> here<00:01:20.380> so<00:01:21.280> there<00:01:21.610> we<00:01:21.730> have<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:21.910> we<00:01:22.270> have<00:01:22.420> our

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
up here so there we have it we have our

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.290 
up here so there we have it we have our
Seagate<00:01:23.050> hard<00:01:23.200> drive<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.760> get<00:01:24.880> slim<00:01:25.240> six

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
Seagate hard drive so you get slim six

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.940 
Seagate hard drive so you get slim six
zoom<00:01:28.300> in<00:01:28.480> there<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.690> little<00:01:28.840> bit<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.800> guys

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
zoom in there a little bit so you guys

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.630 
zoom in there a little bit so you guys
can<00:01:30.100> take<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> better<00:01:30.580> look<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.770> guess<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.310> USB

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
can take a better look and I guess a USB

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510 
can take a better look and I guess a USB
3.0<00:01:34.030> hard<00:01:34.240> drive<00:01:34.479> it's<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.800> super-fast<00:01:35.800> very

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
3.0 hard drive it's a super-fast very

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.969 
3.0 hard drive it's a super-fast very
easy<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.990> transfer<00:01:37.990> stuff<00:01:38.170> over<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:38.890> have

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
easy to transfer stuff over so we have

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.700 
easy to transfer stuff over so we have
these<00:01:39.130> two<00:01:39.400> files<00:01:39.610> here<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:41.020> properties<00:01:41.470> and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
these two files here do properties and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.180 
these two files here do properties and
see<00:01:41.830> combined<00:01:42.729> it's<00:01:43.330> about<00:01:43.770> 325<00:01:44.770> megabytes

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
see combined it's about 325 megabytes

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.160 
see combined it's about 325 megabytes
for<00:01:45.280> both<00:01:45.520> files<00:01:46.380> transfer<00:01:47.380> them<00:01:47.560> over<00:01:52.170> took

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
for both files transfer them over took

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.310 
for both files transfer them over took
about<00:01:53.350> six<00:01:53.649> seconds<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.070> transfer<00:01:54.310> 325

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
about six seconds to transfer 325

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.080 
about six seconds to transfer 325
megabytes<00:01:56.320> for<00:01:56.590> about<00:01:57.130> five<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.399> six<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:57.850> it's

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
megabytes for about five to six so it's

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.820 
megabytes for about five to six so it's
pretty<00:01:58.330> short<00:01:58.660> pretty<00:01:58.840> quick<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.800> have

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
pretty short pretty quick so we have

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.440 
pretty short pretty quick so we have
those<00:02:00.070> files<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:00.729> we<00:02:00.910> have<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.180> two

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
those files in there we have this two

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.400 
those files in there we have this two
one<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.200> named<00:02:02.770> iPhone<00:02:03.460> five<00:02:03.899> shell<00:02:04.899> hosted

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
one is named iPhone five shell hosted

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.200 
one is named iPhone five shell hosted
the<00:02:05.530> other<00:02:05.649> one<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:06.009> zero<00:02:06.340> zero<00:02:06.580> one<00:02:06.729> five<00:02:06.940> and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the other one is zero zero one five and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.490 
the other one is zero zero one five and
now<00:02:07.420> we're<00:02:07.570> going<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.720> transfer<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.259> into

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
now we're going to transfer this into

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.910 
now we're going to transfer this into
our<00:02:08.649> Mac<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.550> MacBook<00:02:09.970> Air<00:02:10.390> here<00:02:11.170> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
our Mac we have a MacBook Air here so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.510 
our Mac we have a MacBook Air here so
just<00:02:12.160> disconnect<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.730> exit<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:14.520> we've

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
just disconnect this exit out we've

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.010 
just disconnect this exit out we've
already<00:02:15.640> gone<00:02:15.820> ahead<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.120> we've<00:02:16.300> installed

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
already gone ahead and we've installed

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.229 
already gone ahead and we've installed
the<00:02:17.530> software<00:02:19.709> into<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> Mac<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.150> don't

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the software into a Mac so that we don't

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.699 
the software into a Mac so that we don't
have<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.540> go<00:02:22.630> through<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> whole<00:02:23.049> process<00:02:23.260> and

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709
