00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
taking a small smudge brush and I'm

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.240 
taking a small smudge brush and I'm
smudging<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:55.990> color<00:01:56.200> along<00:01:56.470> my<00:01:56.710> upper<00:01:56.740> lash

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
smudging that color along my upper lash
