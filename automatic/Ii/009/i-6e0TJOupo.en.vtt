00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.420
 rubens you must be thinking beauty 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.900
 good guys the next xbox the year it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.019
 works with content simultaneously 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.510
 being executed ie you have 10 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.329
 content that you just 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.489
 see and there consecutively opens 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.100
 various other things running the games 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.050
 they could just go back and see 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 anything I was seeing before 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 that's how you can see that I'm going 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.980
 Squeezing the right hand was watching a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 video beauty after simply the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 video I went straight to youtube after the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.809
 youtube left here by clicking here 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 no on leaving and I was playing a game 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.510
 so I'll be able to play the game again 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 the way I was looking're just right 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 so I performed several things myself 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.310
 I'm still going to continue from where I 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.100
 had stopped earlier 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.619
 beauty then simply the xbox year 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 it works simultaneously with several 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.540
 and items being executed at the same 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560
 only one hour comes to the galley that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.020
 The following is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 even with all items closed you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 stopping your xbox the year will start to 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.650
 catch because because he'll need 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.720
 boot the system 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.180
 many people go there and off 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.340
 console and turns the console back on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.329
 you do not need to do this you do not need 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.909
 stand up from the couch 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.040
 it's only you reboot then your xbox 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.000
 one in that way that does this a lot 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.340
 simple 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 then press the menu button on your 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 control will appear this bay that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.759
 tool here you go in 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 settings 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.149
 once there in the settings sector 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 you will navigate the field and energy and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.799
 start push button a here in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.250
 power and startup you see the option 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.229
 Call restart is now just you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 push the button there he will ask if 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.260
 Do you really want to reboot? 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.810
 your console you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.810
 Yes, I hope to reinitialize. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.310
 ready xbox the year already reboot or 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 It takes practically nothing of beauty. 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.909
 screen will turn black and for some 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.190
 instants that is the initialization 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.400
 console and you'll get it back and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.930
 with all its potential to be revitalized 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's say so because all the icons 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 good to be closed and you of course go 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.549
 have all your xbox onu to enjoy there 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.109
 of good performance is right 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.180
 in it is this tip that is 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.190
 important for you who suffer from 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.230
 your xbox one or you have 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 practically full hd because it already has 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.829
 various items or for you 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.349
 they simply run many applications 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.629
 in the xbox and verifies that as the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.690
 How long will you get by starting to 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.150
 view and feel slow on the console 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.400
 then you do not need and until your 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.769
 console off it or sometimes countertop 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.379
 plug and then plug it back in 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.959
 he can then go back to the state 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.150
 normal operation of your game is only 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.060
 you give it a reset andp because 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.489
 executes and everything will be normal 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.190

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.139

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.209
