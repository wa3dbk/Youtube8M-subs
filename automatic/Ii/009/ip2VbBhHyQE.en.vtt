00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 consider the manufacturing process 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 in the title for vertical explanation 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 with use mark to start 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 a plastic prototype of the future is being created 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.340
 headers using plastic for 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:33.619
 baking you dare a piece of plastic and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.619
 let's give it a shape of a future head 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:46.519
 insert into plastic prototype 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:52.229
 the pin and the ear is placed in the oven 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:55.159
 preheated to 120 degrees billet on 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.159
 15 20 minutes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 after cooling and machining 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 we have plastic prototypes of the future 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 headers this way you can 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.899
 make a plastic prototype 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.500
 installation of any form of process 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.450
 making a mold from gypsum was 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 laid out in previously published videos 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.300
 the processed half is rubbed dry 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.300
 and la is oiled 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.360
 on warriors 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.040
 by name 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 and placed collapsible frame is poured 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:02:01.180
 mix injection mold ready 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 left to cut the cast channel and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:16.240
 put in advance cooked ear and you 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.240
 lithium form and proceed to face 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:28.200
 injection mold cooled remove sprue and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:41.319
 test head 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 we put on a new twist head and a bathtub 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.849
 vertical flip reversing 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.900
 attention worth heading carried 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.900
 directional jerks 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:15.690
 behaves like he is a son for fixing 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.320
 Only on stylish palm trees spend on 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.000
 iz sets 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.580
 through the carbine we restore the traine and 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.350
 go fishing then either cs loki then 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.350
 left twice and a walk
