00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
solidify in the meantime I'm going to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.550 
solidify in the meantime I'm going to
make<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.640> cream<00:02:30.790> filling<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.540> I've<00:02:32.080> got<00:02:32.320> some

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
make the cream filling and I've got some

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.200 
make the cream filling and I've got some
marshmallows<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.400> which<00:02:33.520> I'm<00:02:33.700> going<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.000> pop

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
marshmallows here which I'm going to pop

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.060 
marshmallows here which I'm going to pop
in<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.450> microwave<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.470> melt<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:38.710> can<00:02:38.890> see

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
in the microwave to melt you can see

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.290 
in the microwave to melt you can see
that<00:02:39.280> once<00:02:39.460> they<00:02:39.640> come<00:02:39.880> out<00:02:39.910> they've

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
that once they come out they've

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.420 
that once they come out they've
virtually<00:02:40.510> doubled<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.680> capacity

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.250 

I'm<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.640> using<00:02:45.880> my<00:02:46.150> mixer<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.930> going

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
I'm just using my mixer I'm just going

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.070 
I'm just using my mixer I'm just going
to<00:02:47.440> stir<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.980> up<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.220> little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.960> can

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
to stir it up a little bit and you can

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.200 
to stir it up a little bit and you can
see<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> air<00:02:50.800> quickly<00:02:51.070> escapes<00:02:51.790> out<00:02:52.180> of

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
see that the air quickly escapes out of

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.750 
see that the air quickly escapes out of
the<00:02:52.510> marshmallows<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.740> volume<00:02:54.130> reduces

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
the marshmallows and the volume reduces

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.090 
the marshmallows and the volume reduces
again<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.930> I'm<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:56.170> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.710> whip<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.040> a
