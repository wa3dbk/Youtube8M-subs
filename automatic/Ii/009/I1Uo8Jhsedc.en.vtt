00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.510
 in this lesson I'll show you a 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.940
 fundamental exercise to learn with 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.910
 the practice of passing weight from a 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.850
 finger to the other and then to be able to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.230
 play a succession of notes and a 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.140
 exercise that I advise you to do 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.840
 frequently so that these 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.330
 movements become automatic natural 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.090
 for you precisely because these movements 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.200
 constitute the basis of the technique 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.750
 piano now the exercise that you 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.780
 I propose to be done simultaneously with 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.750
 both hands and should be done a lot 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.470
 slowly so check that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.160
 there are no muscular tensions 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.420
 to get to this exercise 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.730
 exercise in the actual exercise 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.280
 we will first give two examples two exercises 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.809
 foreplay with separate hands that you 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 they will then allow to understand and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.280
 perform best 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.289
 exercise together is the exercise 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.810
 real 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.569
 furthermore these example separate hands and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.469
 then of course the exercise with 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.189
 both hands 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:19.969
 we will do them by beating time what 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.850
 means means we will count 12 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:27.499
 34 ie the number 1 and number 2 and number 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:31.440
 3 number 4 in succession rhythmically and 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:34.590
 very slowly that is one way 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.590
 [Music] 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.450
 34 and on this time we will count 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.549
 we will perform the same notes of the exercise 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.860
 and in this way 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.789
 you will learn immediately 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.729
 in addition to the correct technique also a 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.759
 keep time without accelerating e 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.950
 without slowing down and this is already one thing 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.899
 very important believe me why you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.890
 will allow when you will then 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.610
 perform songs to have since 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.060
 right now the consciousness of time 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 that should not accelerate that it should not e 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.459
 which obviously must not slow down 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 then we start from the first exercise 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.040
 preliminary from the first example 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.560
 preliminary one with the right hand 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.350
 then we position ourselves with the hand 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.840
 right so that the first finger 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.540
 stand on the second the king on the third 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.660
 on the fourth I on the fact and the fifth 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.030
 on the usual then in this example in 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.299
 this exercise to eliminate precisely 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.549
 the first finger on a herald and second 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.890
 the king the third my fourth makes the 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.140
 fifth the throne now this exercise 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.790
 preliminary consists of playing two 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.359
 note in succession the first with the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.989
 first finger and the second with the second 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.109
 finger 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.690
 then with the third finger 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.319
 then with the fourth finger and then with the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 fifth finger but the first note will always be 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.680
 the one played with the first finger 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.900
 you will understand better when 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 I will show you this exercise in practice 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.450
 now the movement must be performed 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.840
 using the weight shift from 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.959
 one finger to the other as we have seen 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.560
 extensively in the previous lesson e 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:45.870
 so always remembering to raise the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.359
 finger playing the next note and then 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.340
 then just let it fall back then 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.079
 I'll show you again if I do 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.079
 I want to play kings first then 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.339
