ready to cook now I've had this one

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.290 
ready to cook now I've had this one
resting<00:00:36.199> on<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:37.010> side<00:00:37.250> for<00:00:37.820> about<00:00:37.910> an<00:00:38.120> hour<00:00:38.239> or

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
two now and the reason is because you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.149 
two now and the reason is because you
must<00:00:41.210> have<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:41.930> at<00:00:42.170> room<00:00:42.559> temperature

of<00:04:44.020> doneness<00:04:44.320> done<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.250> itself

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
of doneness done that in that itself

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.500 
of doneness done that in that itself
this<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.800> looking

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510

and<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:54.960> is<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.320> simple<00:04:55.590> but<00:04:55.920> this<00:04:56.430> is

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
and this is so simple but this is

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.710

it's<00:04:58.050> such<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.650> paleo<00:04:59.280> space<00:04:59.580> when<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.910> comes<00:05:00.120> to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
it's such a paleo space when it comes to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.380 
it's such a paleo space when it comes to
breakfast<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.140> evening<00:05:01.980> meals<00:05:02.430> now<00:05:02.790> look<00:05:03.210> I

just<00:05:14.910> literally<00:05:15.390> just<00:05:15.600> slamming<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.680> straight

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
just literally just slamming it straight

onto onto the griddle without a thought

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.200 
onto onto the griddle without a thought
of<00:05:20.400> whether<00:05:20.790> how's<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.290> doneness<00:05:22.940> is<00:05:23.940> -

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
of whether how's the the doneness is -

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.180 
of whether how's the the doneness is -
they're<00:05:24.390> like<00:05:24.600> it<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:25.140> also<00:05:25.530> put<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:25.980> nice

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190

they're like it and also put a nice
straight<00:05:26.460> under<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.700> grill<00:05:27.000> again<00:05:27.510> you've

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
straight under the grill again you've

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.360 
straight under the grill again you've
got<00:05:27.750> no<00:05:27.870> way<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.230> getting<00:05:28.710> up<00:05:28.950> close<00:05:29.100> and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
got no way of getting up close and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.430 
got no way of getting up close and
personal<00:05:29.760> mistaken<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.600> knowing<00:05:30.990> what<00:05:31.200> sort

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
personal mistaken and knowing what sort

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.220 
personal mistaken and knowing what sort
of<00:05:31.710> doneness<00:05:32.610> it<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:32.970> in<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.390> way<00:05:33.600> gives<00:05:34.110> it

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
of doneness it is in this way gives it

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.810 
of doneness it is in this way gives it
so<00:05:34.500> much<00:05:34.530> more<00:05:34.950> flavor<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.370> can<00:05:35.460> add<00:05:35.580> some

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
so much more flavor you can add some

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
salt you can add some pepper but at this
