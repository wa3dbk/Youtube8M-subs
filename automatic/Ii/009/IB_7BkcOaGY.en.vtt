00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
that just when he dies one of those

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.780 
that just when he dies one of those
weird<00:05:00.070> things<00:05:00.430> like<00:05:00.610> Andy<00:05:01.030> Kauffman<00:05:01.230> dying<00:05:02.230> of

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
but maybe I'm wrong but I thought bill

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.590 
but maybe I'm wrong but I thought bill
had<00:05:05.590> turned<00:05:06.010> a<00:05:06.160> corner<00:05:06.370> I<00:05:06.730> listened<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.450> his

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
had turned a corner I listened to his

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.540 
had turned a corner I listened to his

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
and they

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.840 
and they
seen<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.580> data<00:05:12.130> well<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.490> would<00:05:13.610> ordinarily

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
seen that data well you would ordinarily

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.570 
seen that data well you would ordinarily
say<00:05:14.390> 20<00:05:14.720> years<00:05:15.200> is<00:05:15.410> not<00:05:15.590> enough<00:05:15.650> time<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.190> judge

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
say 20 years is not enough time to judge

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.280

my problems with you know Hicks always
thought<00:05:40.370> Leary<00:05:40.670> cocked<00:05:41.090> his<00:05:41.300> attitude<00:05:41.900> Dennis

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.850 
thought Leary cocked his attitude Dennis
and<00:05:43.280> he<00:05:43.850> did<00:05:44.300> not<00:05:44.480> like<00:05:44.780> that<00:05:44.810> so<00:05:45.440> you<00:05:45.740> know

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860

and he did not like that so you know
since<00:05:46.070> I<00:05:46.190> knew<00:05:46.370> Hicks<00:05:46.640> iont<00:05:47.060> sided<00:05:47.480> with<00:05:47.510> him
