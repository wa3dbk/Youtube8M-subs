 FISH FISH 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.740
 Hi, there's Bo` on the road and Authentic World Food. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.480
 We're in the village of Paluwatha in southern Sri Lanka. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.260
 Asha bought fresh fish on the market today 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.280
 so today's recipe will be fish. Very fast and simple. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.520
 Fried crispy fish. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.260
 Clean and gut the fish. Fingers are enough for that. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 And remove the nails with a thin cuticle on the surface. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 It looks like the CD is "a little" scratched;) 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.700
 We cut the fish on both sides in a few places, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.340
 to fry us evenly inside. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.660
 Salt and mix. 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.360
 Heat the wok oil to a high temperature 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.280
 and carefully put fish into it, one at a time, so that the oil does not crack. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.760
 Fry in golden brown for 10-15 minutes. 

00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:42.901
 The fish will be beautifully crispy, including the bones, so it is safe to eat them. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.140
 Served with rice and various types of Sri Lankan curry. 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.120
