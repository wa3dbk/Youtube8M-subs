any of my other videos I also did two
other<00:00:15.349> videos<00:00:15.710> one<00:00:16.040> on<00:00:16.189> the<00:00:16.309> m60<00:00:16.939> and<00:00:17.060> as<00:00:17.750> well

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
other videos one on the m60 and as well

other videos one on the m60 and as well
as<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.050> side-by-side<00:00:18.320> comparison<00:00:18.710> of<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.460> m48

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
as a side-by-side comparison of the m48

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.849 
as a side-by-side comparison of the m48
to<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.300> m60<00:00:20.779> kind<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.200> discussing<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
to the m60 kind of discussing the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.290 
to the m60 kind of discussing the
differences<00:00:22.220> between<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.640> two<00:00:22.760> tanks<00:00:23.090> though

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
differences between the two tanks though

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.470 
differences between the two tanks though
they<00:00:23.840> are<00:00:24.050> very<00:00:24.380> small<00:00:24.789> they<00:00:25.789> both<00:00:26.000> play<00:00:26.269> very

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
they are very small they both play very

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.630 
they are very small they both play very
similarly<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.590> personally<00:00:28.070> seem<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.490> like

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
similarly and I personally seem to like

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.370 
similarly and I personally seem to like
the<00:00:28.820> m48<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.449> have<00:00:29.539> better<00:00:29.720> success<00:00:30.109> in<00:00:30.289> that

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
the m48 and have better success in that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.439 
the m48 and have better success in that
tank<00:00:30.619> over<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.949> m60<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.519> that<00:00:31.820> might<00:00:32.000> go

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
tank over the m60 and that might go

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.240 
tank over the m60 and that might go
coinciding<00:00:32.989> with<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.650> whole<00:00:33.830> thing<00:00:33.860> that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
coinciding with that whole thing that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.920 
coinciding with that whole thing that
wargaming<00:00:34.400> stated<00:00:35.089> that<00:00:35.210> even<00:00:35.390> premium

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
wargaming stated that even premium

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.750 
wargaming stated that even premium
vehicles<00:00:36.379> of<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.589> same<00:00:36.680> tier<00:00:36.890> we're<00:00:37.640> always

vehicles of the same tier we're always

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.060 
vehicles of the same tier we're always
going<00:00:37.969> to<00:00:38.030> be<00:00:38.090> lesser<00:00:38.600> grade<00:00:38.899> or<00:00:39.440> lesser

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
historically accurate way to go about

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.040 
historically accurate way to go about
doing<00:00:48.379> things<00:00:49.100> because<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.520> m60<00:00:49.969> was<00:00:50.050> much

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
doing things because the m60 was much

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.439 
doing things because the m60 was much
more<00:00:51.320> technically<00:00:51.760> logically<00:00:52.760> advanced<00:00:53.329> in

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
more technically logically advanced in

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.500 
more technically logically advanced in
the<00:00:53.629> m48<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:54.649> nonetheless<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.670> m48<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.270> an

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the m48 but nonetheless the m48 is an

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.080 
the m48 but nonetheless the m48 is an
excellent<00:00:56.750> tank<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.320> does<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.399> think<00:00:58.609> in<00:00:58.910> my

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
excellent tank it does do I think in my

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.569 
excellent tank it does do I think in my
opinion<00:00:59.480> better<00:00:59.690> because<00:01:00.199> of<00:01:00.469> its<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:00.829> smaller

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
opinion better because of its a smaller

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.210 
opinion better because of its a smaller
weak<00:01:01.879> points<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:03.410> guns<00:01:03.739> just<00:01:04.009> see<00:01:04.129> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
weak points and the guns just see it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.950 
weak points and the guns just see it
just<00:01:04.250> seems<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.610> be<00:01:04.729> really<00:01:04.910> in<00:01:05.360> my<00:01:05.539> opinion<00:01:05.899> a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
just seems to be really in my opinion a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.510 
just seems to be really in my opinion a
little<00:01:06.050> bit<00:01:06.229> better<00:01:06.410> balanced<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.250> like

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
little bit better balanced you get like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.740 
little bit better balanced you get like
a<00:01:07.550> little<00:01:07.640> slightly<00:01:08.060> better<00:01:08.300> Armour<00:01:08.660> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
a little slightly better Armour in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.320 
a little slightly better Armour in
exchange<00:01:09.140> for<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.619> little<00:01:10.310> less<00:01:10.640> quality<00:01:11.030> gun

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
exchange for a little less quality gun

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.969 
exchange for a little less quality gun
but<00:01:11.599> I<00:01:11.630> mean<00:01:11.899> the<00:01:12.020> rate<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.289> fire<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.770> same

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
but I mean the rate of fire is the same

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.919 
but I mean the rate of fire is the same
and<00:01:13.190> there's<00:01:13.310> like<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:13.670> I've<00:01:13.849> said<00:01:14.119> before<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
and there's like as I've said before the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.719 
and there's like as I've said before the
the<00:01:15.410> things<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:15.800> really<00:01:16.039> work<00:01:16.369> well<00:01:16.580> for

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the things that really work well for

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.180 
the things that really work well for
this<00:01:16.880> vehicle<00:01:17.360> are<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.770> same<00:01:18.920> as<00:01:19.099> the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
this vehicle are about the same as the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.889 
this vehicle are about the same as the
m60<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:19.970> some<00:01:20.149> senses<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.539> little<00:01:20.810> bit

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
m60 and in some senses a little bit

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.240 
m60 and in some senses a little bit
better<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.259> areas<00:01:21.590> where<00:01:21.619> they<00:01:21.830> should<00:01:22.099> be

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
better in the areas where they should be

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.520 
better in the areas where they should be
in<00:01:22.399> my<00:01:22.550> opinion<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:23.060> my<00:01:23.209> play<00:01:23.450> style

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
in my opinion in my play style

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.460 
in my opinion in my play style
and<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.190> reason<00:01:25.459> why<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.640> because<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.539> feel

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
and the reason why is because I feel

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.199 
and the reason why is because I feel
like<00:01:27.500> most<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.099> the<00:01:28.220> engagements<00:01:28.910> that<00:01:28.940> you'll

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
like most of the engagements that you'll

with<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.329> sometimes<00:03:17.750> when<00:03:18.109> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
with that is is that sometimes when you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.050 
with that is is that sometimes when you
do<00:03:18.379> do<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.709> you're<00:03:19.189> gonna<00:03:19.310> explode<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:19.790> die

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
do do that you're gonna explode and die

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
do do that you're gonna explode and die
and<00:03:20.359> other<00:03:20.510> times<00:03:20.689> you're<00:03:21.049> gonna<00:03:21.169> light<00:03:21.409> up<00:03:21.439> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and other times you're gonna light up a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.719 
and other times you're gonna light up a
bunch<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.889> targets<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.489> lot<00:03:22.699> of

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:22.729 
bunch of targets and have a lot of

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.990 
bunch of targets and have a lot of
success<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.900> as<00:03:24.169> I<00:03:24.349> move<00:03:24.500> out<00:03:24.680> surprise<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.790> run

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
success so as I move out surprise I run

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.749 
success so as I move out surprise I run
right<00:03:26.180> into<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:26.449> 704<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.409> do<00:03:27.829> get<00:03:28.129> a<00:03:28.159> shot<00:03:28.430> off<00:03:28.579> on

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:28.759 
right into a 704 I do get a shot off on

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.939 
right into a 704 I do get a shot off on
him<00:03:28.879> but<00:03:29.000> he<00:03:29.060> does<00:03:29.239> nail<00:03:30.079> me<00:03:30.319> for<00:03:30.349> a<00:03:30.560> good<00:03:30.709> chunk

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
him but he does nail me for a good chunk

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.640 
him but he does nail me for a good chunk
of<00:03:31.040> my<00:03:31.159> HP<00:03:31.609> but<00:03:32.389> a<00:03:32.599> surprising<00:03:33.199> I<00:03:33.290> don't<00:03:33.439> take<00:03:33.620> a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
of my HP but a surprising I don't take a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.030 
of my HP but a surprising I don't take a
lot<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.979> fire<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:34.759> and<00:03:35.120> with<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.379> support<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
lot of fire so and with the support the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.039 
lot of fire so and with the support the
704<00:03:37.669> burns<00:03:37.879> down<00:03:38.090> real<00:03:38.329> quick<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.689> I<00:03:38.750> decided

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
704 burns down real quick so I decided

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.839 
704 burns down real quick so I decided
to<00:03:39.199> take<00:03:39.319> this<00:03:39.439> opportunity<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:40.609> close<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
to take this opportunity to close a

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.520 
to take this opportunity to close a
little<00:03:41.150> bit<00:03:41.269> closer<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.959> kind<00:03:42.199> of<00:03:42.259> see<00:03:42.349> if<00:03:42.439> I

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
little bit closer and kind of see if I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.050 
little bit closer and kind of see if I
can<00:03:42.680> support<00:03:42.979> that<00:03:43.069> light<00:03:43.370> that's<00:03:43.609> moving<00:03:43.819> up

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
can support that light that's moving up

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.899 
can support that light that's moving up
and<00:03:44.389> maybe<00:03:45.229> get<00:03:45.439> some<00:03:45.470> other<00:03:45.739> shots<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.250> any<00:03:46.759> of

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
and maybe get some other shots on any of

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.550 
and maybe get some other shots on any of
the<00:03:47.000> other<00:03:47.120> targets<00:03:47.479> that<00:03:47.540> may<00:03:47.629> be<00:03:48.019> located<00:03:48.319> in

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
the other targets that may be located in

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.530 
the other targets that may be located in
the<00:03:48.650> forest<00:03:48.979> and<00:03:49.129> make<00:03:49.280> sure<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.729> it's<00:03:50.239> empty

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
the forest and make sure that it's empty

that<00:04:01.759> medium<00:04:02.719> did<00:04:02.870> exactly<00:04:03.229> what<00:04:03.319> he<00:04:03.439> was

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
that medium did exactly what he was

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.439 
that medium did exactly what he was
supposed<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.919> be<00:04:04.069> doing<00:04:04.370> but<00:04:04.669> we<00:04:05.239> had<00:04:05.419> really

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
supposed to be doing but we had really

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.749 
supposed to be doing but we had really
good<00:04:05.930> sniper<00:04:06.259> support<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.040> they<00:04:07.400> were<00:04:07.459> just

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:07.759 
good sniper support and they were just

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.729 
good sniper support and they were just
too<00:04:07.939> light<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.359> forest<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:09.409> where<00:04:09.590> he

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
too light in the forest to where he

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.920 
too light in the forest to where he
could<00:04:09.919> make<00:04:09.949> a<00:04:10.069> difference<00:04:10.519> if<00:04:10.719> it's<00:04:11.719> it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
could make a difference if it's it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.319 
could make a difference if it's it's
unfortunate<00:04:12.109> that<00:04:12.680> he<00:04:12.919> bit<00:04:13.699> the<00:04:13.819> dust<00:04:14.030> but

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
unfortunate that he bit the dust but

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.360 
unfortunate that he bit the dust but
nonetheless<00:04:14.989> it<00:04:15.289> happened<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.219> in

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
the process of doing so that light was

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.270 
the process of doing so that light was
able<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.709> take<00:04:18.979> out<00:04:19.159> and<00:04:19.489> destroy<00:04:20.199> the

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
m60 as I said before you can do a lot of

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.510 
m60 as I said before you can do a lot of
the<00:05:44.389> same<00:05:44.599> things<00:05:44.900> that<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.229> can<00:05:45.530> do<00:05:45.770> in<00:05:46.009> this

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the same things that you can do in this

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.770 
the same things that you can do in this
tank<00:05:46.759> that<00:05:46.970> you<00:05:47.000> can<00:05:47.240> do<00:05:47.389> in<00:05:47.719> the<00:05:47.900> m60<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.780> not

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
tank that you can do in the m60 so not

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.409 
tank that you can do in the m60 so not
too<00:05:50.900> much<00:05:51.050> of<00:05:51.199> a<00:05:51.259> gimp<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.729> you<00:05:52.729> know<00:05:52.820> the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
too much of a gimp and you know the

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.089 
too much of a gimp and you know the
characteristics<00:05:54.050> are<00:05:54.169> so<00:05:54.320> similar<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.830> just

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
characteristics are so similar it just

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.520 
characteristics are so similar it just
you<00:05:55.430> know<00:05:55.520> it's<00:05:55.669> not<00:05:55.820> really<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.120> big<00:05:57.080> deal<00:05:57.289> I

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
you know it's not really a big deal I

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.890 
you know it's not really a big deal I
mean<00:05:58.130> if<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.340> didn't<00:05:58.580> lock<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.820> m60<00:05:59.360> I

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
mean if you didn't lock the m60 I

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.959 
mean if you didn't lock the m60 I
wouldn't<00:06:00.710> you<00:06:01.099> know<00:06:01.219> you<00:06:01.310> could<00:06:01.550> probably<00:06:01.699> can

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969 
wouldn't you know you could probably can

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.659 
wouldn't you know you could probably can
just<00:06:02.300> use<00:06:02.659> that<00:06:02.870> tank<00:06:03.139> and<00:06:03.320> be<00:06:04.130> sufficient

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
just use that tank and be sufficient

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.129 
just use that tank and be sufficient
with<00:06:04.759> it<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.030> wouldn't<00:06:05.270> necessarily<00:06:05.780> need<00:06:05.990> to

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
with it you wouldn't necessarily need to

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.560 
with it you wouldn't necessarily need to
unlock<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.560> m48<00:06:07.070> but<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.729> already<00:06:08.270> had<00:06:08.479> the

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
for me anyway but there we go destroying

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.620 
for me anyway but there we go destroying
that<00:06:17.840> east<00:06:17.990> 75<00:06:18.409> again<00:06:18.849> seeing<00:06:19.849> the<00:06:20.270> power<00:06:20.449> of

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
that east 75 again seeing the power of

that east 75 again seeing the power of
that<00:06:20.750> gun<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:21.320> the<00:06:22.219> effectiveness<00:06:22.759> of<00:06:23.030> how

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
that gun and the effectiveness of how

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.149 
that gun and the effectiveness of how
consistently<00:06:24.139> you<00:06:24.320> can<00:06:24.380> hit<00:06:24.590> targets<00:06:25.009> at

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
consistently you can hit targets at

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.129

range<00:06:25.430> and<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:26.150> reload<00:06:26.449> time<00:06:26.630> on<00:06:26.780> it's<00:06:26.960> not

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
range and the reload time on it's not

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.620 
range and the reload time on it's not
too<00:06:27.320> bad<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.830> blue<00:06:28.070> isn't<00:06:28.490> the<00:06:28.969> greatest<00:06:29.419> on

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
too bad the blue isn't the greatest on

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.089 
too bad the blue isn't the greatest on
this<00:06:29.780> gun<00:06:29.990> it<00:06:30.169> used<00:06:30.349> to<00:06:30.469> be<00:06:30.560> a<00:06:30.590> lot<00:06:30.830> better

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
this gun it used to be a lot better

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.860 
this gun it used to be a lot better
before<00:06:31.430> they<00:06:31.729> nerfed<00:06:31.969> the<00:06:32.180> vehicle<00:06:32.539> a<00:06:32.690> few

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
before they nerfed the vehicle a few

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.010 
before they nerfed the vehicle a few
patches<00:06:33.020> back<00:06:33.699> but<00:06:34.699> it's<00:06:34.940> still<00:06:35.210> not<00:06:35.570> bad<00:06:35.810> the

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
patches back but it's still not bad the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.749 
patches back but it's still not bad the
aim<00:06:36.110> time<00:06:36.320> on<00:06:36.560> it's<00:06:36.740> respectable<00:06:37.310> I'd<00:06:37.580> say

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
aim time on it's respectable I'd say

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.640 
aim time on it's respectable I'd say
this<00:06:37.909> is<00:06:38.060> just<00:06:38.270> this<00:06:38.479> uh<00:06:38.539> the<00:06:39.169> patent<00:06:39.500> is<00:06:39.620> a

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
this is just this uh the patent is a

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.990 
this is just this uh the patent is a
really<00:06:40.009> it's<00:06:40.699> a<00:06:40.849> good<00:06:41.120> all-round<00:06:42.639> mid<00:06:43.639> to<00:06:43.789> long

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
really it's a good all-round mid to long

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.409 
really it's a good all-round mid to long
range<00:06:44.029> vehicle

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
range vehicle

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.959

up-close-and-personal<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:47.280> reload<00:06:47.639> isn't

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969 
up-close-and-personal the reload isn't

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:49.969 
up-close-and-personal the reload isn't
too<00:06:48.509> quick<00:06:48.840> and<00:06:49.080> because<00:06:49.439> it's<00:06:49.590> a<00:06:49.680> little<00:06:49.889> bit

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
too quick and because it's a little bit

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.670 
too quick and because it's a little bit
slower<00:06:50.479> it<00:06:51.479> kind<00:06:51.750> of<00:06:51.810> makes<00:06:51.990> it<00:06:52.110> hard<00:06:52.379> for<00:06:52.469> you

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
slower it kind of makes it hard for you

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.610 
slower it kind of makes it hard for you
to<00:06:52.710> maneuver<00:06:53.099> in<00:06:53.400> some<00:06:53.610> instances<00:06:54.180> so<00:06:54.629> that's

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
to maneuver in some instances so that's

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.959 
to maneuver in some instances so that's
something<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:55.949> be<00:06:56.099> mindful<00:06:56.370> of<00:06:56.639> and<00:06:56.819> to<00:06:56.879> be

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969 
something to be mindful of and to be

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:58.540 
something to be mindful of and to be
careful<00:06:57.300> of<00:06:57.389> when<00:06:57.509> you're<00:06:57.659> playing<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.020> tank

as I'm done doing the tier 10s as I get

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:25.219 
as I'm done doing the tier 10s as I get
a<00:07:23.969> good<00:07:24.180> game<00:07:24.419> so<00:07:24.599> I<00:07:24.659> kind<00:07:24.810> of<00:07:24.840> want<00:07:25.020> to<00:07:25.050> focus

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229 
a good game so I kind of want to focus

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.010 
a good game so I kind of want to focus
in<00:07:25.500> on<00:07:25.650> those<00:07:25.830> because<00:07:26.159> I<00:07:26.520> think<00:07:27.330> that<00:07:27.569> tier

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
in on those because I think that tier

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.269 
in on those because I think that tier
tends<00:07:28.259> while<00:07:28.500> a<00:07:28.529> lot<00:07:28.800> of<00:07:28.889> people<00:07:29.129> aren't

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:29.279 
tends while a lot of people aren't

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.950
