like the packaging of these lip products

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.100 
like the packaging of these lip products
it's<00:02:42.190> very<00:02:42.520> similar<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.480> original<00:02:43.600> balm

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it's very similar to the original balm

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.080 
it's very similar to the original balm
same<00:02:44.410> packaging<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.940> can

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
same packaging and I like that you can

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.640 
same packaging and I like that you can
tell<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.390> difference<00:02:46.720> between<00:02:46.840> which<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.410> is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
tell the difference between which one is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.770 
tell the difference between which one is
shiny<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.220> which<00:02:48.370> one<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.790> matte<00:02:49.180> formula

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
shiny and which one is the matte formula

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.350 
shiny and which one is the matte formula
I<00:02:49.990> also<00:02:50.709> happen<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.160> really<00:02:51.520> like<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.090> mint

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I also happen to really like the mint

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.270 
I also happen to really like the mint
taste<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.140> smell<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> think<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.250> just

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
taste and smell and I think that is just

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.890 
taste and smell and I think that is just
a<00:02:54.489> personal<00:02:54.880> preference<00:02:55.150> whether<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.690> like

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
a personal preference whether you like

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.660 
a personal preference whether you like
mint<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.500> your<00:02:56.590> lip<00:02:56.800> products<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.250> not<00:02:57.400> I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
mint and your lip products or not I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.449 
mint and your lip products or not I
think<00:02:58.630> my<00:02:58.750> main<00:02:59.200> issue<00:02:59.560> with<00:02:59.950> these<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.310> that

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
think my main issue with these is that

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.150 
think my main issue with these is that
Revlon<00:03:01.000> used<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.630> term<00:03:01.900> balm<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.980> name

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
Revlon used the term balm in the name

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.860 
Revlon used the term balm in the name
and<00:03:03.370> when<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.550> think<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.970> lip<00:03:04.180> balm<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.570> think

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and when I think of a lip balm I think

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.240 
and when I think of a lip balm I think
of<00:03:04.989> something<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.500> want<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:05.980> use<00:03:06.220> for

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
of something that I want to use for

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.070 
of something that I want to use for
immediate<00:03:06.970> relief<00:03:07.270> when<00:03:07.510> my<00:03:07.600> lips<00:03:07.870> are<00:03:08.050> dry

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
immediate relief when my lips are dry

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.530 
immediate relief when my lips are dry
and<00:03:08.709> chapped<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> while<00:03:09.760> these<00:03:10.000> are<00:03:10.180> not<00:03:10.330> the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and chapped and while these are not the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.420 
and chapped and while these are not the
most<00:03:10.690> drying<00:03:11.260> lip<00:03:11.530> products<00:03:11.890> I've<00:03:11.980> ever<00:03:12.130> used

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
most drying lip products I've ever used

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.729 
most drying lip products I've ever used
I<00:03:12.670> don't<00:03:13.090> think<00:03:13.360> they<00:03:13.450> improve<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.200> condition

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
I don't think they improve the condition

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
I don't think they improve the condition
of<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.130> lips<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.570> honestly<00:03:16.900> don't<00:03:17.110> think

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
of my lips and I honestly don't think

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.740 
of my lips and I honestly don't think
these<00:03:17.530> look<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.310> great<00:03:18.519> over<00:03:19.030> dry<00:03:19.330> rough

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
these look that great over dry rough

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.810 
these look that great over dry rough

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
chapped lips I'm going to want to use

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.550 
chapped lips I'm going to want to use
these<00:03:22.120> when<00:03:22.360> my<00:03:22.480> lips<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:22.870> already<00:03:23.290> pretty

long the shine last on my lips and I
also<00:06:13.030> like<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.780> L'Oreal<00:06:14.230> version

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650

guess<00:06:17.950> the<00:06:18.100> one<00:06:18.370> plus<00:06:18.880> side<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.750> Revlon<00:06:20.140> is

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
guess the one plus side to the Revlon is

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.890 
guess the one plus side to the Revlon is
that<00:06:20.440> the<00:06:20.590> Revlon<00:06:20.980> display<00:06:21.400> had<00:06:21.670> so<00:06:22.240> many<00:06:22.480> more

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
that the Revlon display had so many more

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.390 
that the Revlon display had so many more
colors<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.710> choose<00:06:23.860> from<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.250> you<00:06:24.310> were

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
pretty limited with the amount of colors
