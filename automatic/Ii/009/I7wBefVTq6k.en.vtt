armed a 10-round game i'm thinking maybe
go<00:02:38.520> six<00:02:38.940> than<00:02:39.180> having<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.810> random<00:02:40.319> but<00:02:40.700> ten

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
go six than having it be random but ten

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.270 
go six than having it be random but ten
rounds<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.600> might<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.840> fine<00:02:43.170> um<00:02:43.410> in
