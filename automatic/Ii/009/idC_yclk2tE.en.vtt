00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
high some of them were low it can run

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
high some of them were low it can run
everything<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.520> high<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> kind<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
everything with high but it kind of

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.680 
everything with high but it kind of
drops<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.230> few<00:00:52.620> frames<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.480> was

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
drops a few frames so I think this was

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.980 
drops a few frames so I think this was
the<00:00:54.809> best<00:00:54.960> configuration
