00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 and also pay to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 but if 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.330
 for the length you need a bedrock pie can be traces 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.489

 armor stand named spike here's a family 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.430
 spike is also a parameter marker he has 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.829
 that was not her bare and the menu and his 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.540
 hit the same type parameters so we 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.299
 we will see him a gram at gravity not to 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.200
 fell and but also so that he blasts there low and 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:46.340
 so on but also met right there this one could 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.980
 dies if he will smartsheet 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.620
 die wedding writes began 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.000
 all selected items with idi hips 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.310

 discarded items site hip them 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.560
 to do them with. mandate 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.880
 all spikes are made visible were taken three 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.160
 blocks and 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.980
 they put Kostanay as was on one 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.370
 so that we can see them, it means we have 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.790
 Reishi eat and would throw here stood 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.070
 everything 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.430
 and instead of true to apparent like blocks and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.560
 it became insulting the name we take bedrock and they 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.110
 they are using this one monoblock duck 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.100
 again become invisible with invisible 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:39.630
 revered as soon as it starts to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.280
 monoblock from the outflow group walks spike. 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.960
 duct installation glad all shopam liar from 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.050
 four blocks added to scoreboard 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.530
 spike one start and we see it in 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.530
 sidebar 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:05.939
 so that's where there is the faithful 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:07.800
 coachman steak on exit 0 here he is 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.169
 approached and three spikes 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.099
 because they dug a radius in it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.479
 their became units up to 4 as well as 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:24.569
 only the player comes close to the thorn 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:27.449
 will cover the team about who is coming to 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.819
 a thorn dense all the radius of one 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.370
 block scoreboard blah added 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:40.050
 a hundred and as I said when the game 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:44.669
 comes near the Turks dense here 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:50.430
 teams could put the board abut junction 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:53.240
 this soft 99 is put on 100 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.250
 and teams could the same ticker 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.409
 fit ask 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.190
 quite begins the 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.940
 city score 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.830
 giving this to the teams and when 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.479
 scoreboard and sense and less than zero you 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.430
 something changes and this is what we have 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.569
 changes when the group its paid 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.000
 kasipu means my scoreboard spike 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.039
 too tried to units and these by 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.599
 block teams start to force 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:24.449
 This spike puts saplin gel but since 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:28.169
 command block 2 then of how would spike species 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.810
 also 2 depends on the poisoned spike 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.629
 or not that is when we come to 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.680
 this soup 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:37.080
 just like a fur coat he 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.000
 ships back here is the usual here is the usual tire 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.040
 Aida seedlings katsii because 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.910
 starting to eat here is usually planted order 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.520
 and put 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.110
 because these schools have starboard spike 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.350
 blood less than zero from the window come here 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.680
 scoreboard 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:58.410
 have three thorns 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.360
 equal to 99 i.e. the device becomes 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.780
 more than 0 and put it just crab 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.060
 spikes 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.150
 then the scoreboard begins to decrease 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.010
 get out just holding down do not shrink 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.320
 and soon he knows less 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.690
 and in fact remains the usual spikes like this all 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.540
 just works even when we depart 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.700
 this is a command block that just changes us 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:21.740
 all sapegina air due to the fact that 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:25.980
 skywards lower back zero equals yes 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:29.270
 I hope that everything is far download poet 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.290
 paint goodbye 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.290
 in general, bye everyone 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:42.420
 minimalism
