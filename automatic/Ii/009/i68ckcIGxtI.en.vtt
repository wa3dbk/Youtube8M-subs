00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.110 

there

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690 

majesty<00:03:24.049> step<00:03:24.680> behind<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.220> camera<00:03:25.670> and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
majesty step behind the camera and

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.770 
majesty step behind the camera and
looked<00:03:27.129> when<00:03:28.129> he<00:03:28.159> put<00:03:28.489> his<00:03:28.519> finger<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.239> up

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
looked when he put his finger there up

looked when he put his finger there up
we<00:03:30.470> just<00:03:30.650> dropped<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.220> worm<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.819> ground

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
we just dropped the worm on the ground

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.550 
we just dropped the worm on the ground
hang<00:03:32.959> on

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.800 

so<00:03:41.099> true<00:03:41.550> casts<00:03:42.830> two<00:03:43.830> catches<00:03:44.569> we're<00:03:45.569> getting

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so true casts two catches we're getting

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.559 
so true casts two catches we're getting
another<00:03:46.020> piece<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.470> warm<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:47.270> that's<00:03:48.270> what<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
another piece of warm on that's what the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.880 
another piece of warm on that's what the
holdup<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:50.989> all<00:03:51.989> right<00:03:54.380> now<00:03:55.380> let's<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.770> we

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
holdup is all right now let's see if we

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.210 
holdup is all right now let's see if we
can<00:03:56.069> hit<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:57.260> we're<00:03:58.260> looking<00:03:58.590> for<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.920> pool

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
can hit it we're looking for that pool

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.640 
can hit it we're looking for that pool
right<00:03:59.849> there<00:04:00.090> right<00:04:00.840> where<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.170> float<00:04:01.410> went

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
right there right where the float went

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.330 
right there right where the float went
in<00:04:02.420> perfect<00:04:03.420> shot<00:04:03.920> let's<00:04:04.920> see<00:04:05.069> if<00:04:05.130> there's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
in perfect shot let's see if there's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.860 
in perfect shot let's see if there's
anybody<00:04:05.580> in<00:04:05.819> there

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.750 

now<00:04:12.440> we're<00:04:12.709> off<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.980> Steve<00:04:13.220> caught<00:04:13.489> those
