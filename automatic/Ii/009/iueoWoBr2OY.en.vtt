so that's where Milton's toadies live
and<00:01:29.229> we<00:01:30.190> built<00:01:30.400> them<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:30.610> little<00:01:30.940> house<00:01:31.120> because

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
toads dig holes during the daytime so

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.650 
toads dig holes during the daytime so
