it's<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.550> good<00:01:06.730> idea<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.240> have<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.470> student

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
it's a good idea to have the student

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.890 
it's a good idea to have the student
that<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.400> bigger<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:09.880> stronger<00:01:10.120> one<00:01:10.510> to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
that is the bigger and stronger one to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.080 
that is the bigger and stronger one to
put<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.230> gear<00:01:11.410> on<00:01:11.470> first<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.610> way<00:01:12.850> they're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
put the gear on first that way they're

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.150 
put the gear on first that way they're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the second set of gear now Jarrod and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.010 
the second set of gear now Jarrod and
Caitlin<00:01:20.200> together<00:01:20.530> working<00:01:21.010> as<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.190> team<00:01:22.020> are

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
Caitlin together working as a team are

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.720 
Caitlin together working as a team are
going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.500> lift<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.860> gear<00:01:24.070> together

all<00:01:32.300> right<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:32.690> next<00:01:32.900> let's<00:01:33.200> talk<00:01:33.260> about<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
all right so next let's talk about the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.310 
all right so next let's talk about the
mini<00:01:34.340> dive<00:01:34.610> from<00:01:34.910> confined<00:01:35.510> water<00:01:35.750> dive<00:01:35.990> five

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
mini dive from confined water dive five

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.980 
mini dive from confined water dive five
your<00:01:37.190> students<00:01:37.640> are<00:01:37.790> now<00:01:37.910> working<00:01:38.210> great<00:01:38.720> as

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
your students are now working great as

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.960 
your students are now working great as
buddies<00:01:39.440> from<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.040> first<00:01:40.340> four<00:01:40.550> confined

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
buddies from the first four confined

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.970 
buddies from the first four confined
water<00:01:41.150> dives<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:42.020> their<00:01:42.290> Boise<00:01:42.680> skills

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
water dives and their Boise skills

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.470 
water dives and their Boise skills
should<00:01:43.100> be<00:01:43.160> very<00:01:43.460> nice<00:01:43.730> by<00:01:44.030> now

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
should be very nice by now

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.710 
should be very nice by now
so<00:01:44.960> let's<00:01:45.230> allow<00:01:45.560> them<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.340> become<00:01:46.550> real<00:01:47.360> dive

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
so let's allow them to become real dive

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.950 
so let's allow them to become real dive
teams<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.500> dive<00:01:49.250> buddy<00:01:49.490> groups<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.120> do<00:01:50.690> their

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
teams in dive buddy groups and do their

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.010 
teams in dive buddy groups and do their
dives<00:01:51.200> using<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.280> new<00:01:52.430> patio<00:01:52.840> planning<00:01:53.840> guide

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
dives using the new patio planning guide

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.710 
dives using the new patio planning guide
planning<00:01:54.440> slate<00:01:54.650> here<00:01:54.890> they<00:01:55.550> can<00:01:55.940> plan<00:01:56.450> their

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
planning slate here they can plan their

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.000 
planning slate here they can plan their
dives<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.560> jump<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.790> do<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> nice<00:01:59.300> dive

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
dives and jump in and do a nice dive

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.650 
dives and jump in and do a nice dive
allowing<00:02:01.010> them<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.340> simulate<00:02:02.120> what<00:02:02.360> it's

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
allowing them to simulate what it's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.630 
allowing them to simulate what it's
really<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:03.020> for<00:02:03.350> them<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> go<00:02:03.740> diving<00:02:04.010> since

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
really like for them to go diving since

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.860 
really like for them to go diving since
we're<00:02:04.790> going<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.030> them<00:02:05.330> do<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:05.660> in

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
we're going to have them do that in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.380 
we're going to have them do that in
their<00:02:06.410> fourth<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.010> open<00:02:07.400> water<00:02:07.580> dive<00:02:07.880> now<00:02:08.090> as

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
their fourth the open water dive now as

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.300 
their fourth the open water dive now as
well<00:02:08.630> it's<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.200> good<00:02:09.440> chance<00:02:09.740> for<00:02:09.980> them<00:02:10.130> to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
well it's a good chance for them to

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
well it's a good chance for them to
practice<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:11.030> ok<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.170> what<00:02:12.710> we're<00:02:12.860> gonna<00:02:12.920> do

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
practice that ok so what we're gonna do
