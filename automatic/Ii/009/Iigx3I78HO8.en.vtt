pivot and the shoulder turn is how you

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.840 
pivot and the shoulder turn is how you
start<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.529> take<00:00:16.710> your<00:00:16.890> racket<00:00:17.279> back<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.730> there

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
are a couple differences first if we

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
are a couple differences first if we
replay<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> pivot<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> shoulder<00:00:21.930> turn

what<00:00:22.439> you'll<00:00:22.590> notice<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.189> when<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.789> pivot

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
what you'll notice is that when I pivot

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960 
what you'll notice is that when I pivot
and<00:00:24.420> turn<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.990> laying<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> racket<00:00:26.550> head<00:00:26.699> back

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and turn I'm laying the racket head back

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
and turn I'm laying the racket head back
so<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.390> laying<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> racket<00:00:28.529> back<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.070> my

so I'm laying the racket back with my

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.479 
so I'm laying the racket back with my
wrist<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.970> when<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.470> even<00:00:32.309> though<00:00:32.460> my

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
hand is in between my shoulders so my

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.010 
hand is in between my shoulders so my
hand<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.270> somewhere<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.660> between<00:00:36.690> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
hand is somewhere in between my

shoulders I don't want it coming any
further<00:00:38.700> back<00:00:39.239> than<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.230> shoulder<00:00:40.649> then

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
further back than my back shoulder then

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
further back than my back shoulder then
I've<00:00:40.890> taken<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.430> too<00:00:41.700> far<00:00:42.200> when<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> lay

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I've taken it back too far when I lay

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
I've taken it back too far when I lay
the<00:00:43.680> racket<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.789> racket<00:00:45.210> head<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the racket back the racket head is now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
the racket back the racket head is now
behind<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.829> hands<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> want

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
behind my hands so that's what you want

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
behind my hands so that's what you want
the<00:00:48.360> hands<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.050> between<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the hands going to be in between the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.720 
the hands going to be in between the
shoulders<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> racket<00:00:50.399> head<00:00:50.489> will<00:00:50.640> be

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
shoulders but the racket head will be

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
shoulders but the racket head will be
angled<00:00:51.120> back<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> front<00:00:52.890> view<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
angled back now from the front view the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
angled back now from the front view the
other<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> point<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
other thing I want to point out is that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639 
other thing I want to point out is that
when<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.300> pivot<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.840> turn<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.230> shoulders

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
when you pivot and turn the shoulders

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.000 
when you pivot and turn the shoulders
because<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.280> racket<00:00:59.730> head<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> angled<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
because the racket head is angled up the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
because the racket head is angled up the
racket<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> arm<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.539> relationship

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
racket and the arm that relationship

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
racket and the arm that relationship
some<00:01:04.739> coaches<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.400> compared<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
some coaches have compared that to a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
some coaches have compared that to a
u-shape<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.360> more

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
u-shape so if we take a look one more

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
u-shape so if we take a look one more
time<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.990> pivot<00:01:10.260> turn<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> shoulders<00:01:11.310> racket

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
time I pivot turn the shoulders racket

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
time I pivot turn the shoulders racket
