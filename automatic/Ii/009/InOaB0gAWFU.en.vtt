00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
so what should be number one on the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.500 
so what should be number one on the
Bailey<00:04:03.410> government's<00:04:04.070> hit<00:04:04.280> list<00:04:04.519> well<00:04:05.269> number

Bailey government's hit list well number

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.420 
Bailey government's hit list well number
one<00:04:05.690> I<00:04:05.720> think<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.350> further<00:04:06.680> investment<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
one I think is further investment in the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460 
one I think is further investment in the
public<00:04:07.730> transportation<00:04:08.120> network<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.290> other

public transportation network the other

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.069 
public transportation network the other
option<00:04:09.860> of<00:04:09.920> course<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.690> decentralize<00:04:11.690> jobs

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
option of course is to decentralize jobs
