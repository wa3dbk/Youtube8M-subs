00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 on television with a handsome man cooking 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.790
 and you are looking at me it is very easy for me 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 you will love signal so that all 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 to serve you last night you seemed like guests 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 or of course to his family and Rodrigo 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 is starting to fry garlic onions and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.859
 the meat are super and I bought a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 pasta sauce already done I have my 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.630
 oregano here nothing else I have pasta cooked 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.880
 I'm using spaghetti remember that the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.099
 term is al dente when we have to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 pay for it when you take them out 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 can chew and in the center you see a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 little white dot remember that you are going to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.219
 be living depending on the quality 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 of the pasta is what can be perfumed 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.399
 I can never lay a laurel 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 I bought because I do not like it later with a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.390
 face onion or garlic and if you are going to do it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 with other ingredients that I will not use 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 mine with onion do not put anything else that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.500
 a touch of salt and little before I said 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 that the pasta was known in a water 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 salty as equal mediterranean but I say 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 you're too much too much sodium 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.370
 some white powder also makes bad 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.020
 suddenly it is not 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.700
 it's really bought or what is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.400
 convenient as the sauce says 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.440
 that there really are people who do 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 they want to make salsa with powers and they 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
 can do what good if we do not have 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 time to the best the day after I do not know 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.550
 worry about buying the account should 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 you would say to me a little pink like 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.150
 you have at that time so that you do not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.300
 about cooking because it's going to go into the oven 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.490
 and if we catch it other silva dries sun 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.140
 what exactly and apart nothing more value 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 it's not going to go to gratinar I'm 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.120
 putting a good look 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.580
 what success 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.380
 and what we have at home does not matter 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 because the mozzarella can be manchego 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.880
 that there is here has parmesan does not have 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.880
 feels so fat to gratinate 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 what I love is that this is 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.470
 spaghetti and not spaghetti spaghetti 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.659

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.090
 we help to blow spaghetti aside 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.350
 is this is this when you go to meals 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.350
 running to the markets they tell you 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.260
 why 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.380
 and this is for getty very very thick that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.700

 little egg crashed on top 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.080

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.710
 otherwise they will take us as extras 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.640

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.660

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.660

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.080
 more overcome better you want to respect 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.830
 some more calm like the denied mother 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.680

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.270

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.459

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.479
 singing 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.910

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:31.960

 'This tell me that I failed you 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.129
 that was that I already made rock back 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.129

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.660
 I've been told a lot about Dad 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:53.460
 why but the truth is that the 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.410
 fiction allows you to be able to do that is 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.240
 clear clear perfection allows you to 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.210
