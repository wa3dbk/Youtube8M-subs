that where you can access the metal tabs
right<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:56.280> inside<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> after<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
right there right inside so after that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.360 
right there right inside so after that
what<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.710> take<00:01:02.219> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
what you want to do is just take this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.880 
what you want to do is just take this
instrument<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:05.030> pry<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.460> first<00:01:08.820> metal<00:01:09.299> tab

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
instrument and pry the first metal tab

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:19.200 
instrument and pry the first metal tab
until<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.189> bends<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:16.610> inside

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
until it bends up inside

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110 
until it bends up inside
okay<00:01:20.210> once<00:01:21.050> it's<00:01:21.200> been<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:22.160> will<00:01:22.430> be<00:01:22.670> damaged

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
okay once it's been it will be damaged

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.010 
okay once it's been it will be damaged
so<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:24.050> won't<00:01:24.320> catch<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:26.030> security<00:01:26.870> case

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
so it won't catch the security case

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.460 
so it won't catch the security case
anymore

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
anymore

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.800 
anymore

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
so the second metal tab is right here

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.150 
so the second metal tab is right here
