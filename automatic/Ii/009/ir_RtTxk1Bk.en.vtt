of the month for much 2010 new band list

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
so I thought I'll start off strong with

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.600 
so I thought I'll start off strong with
the<00:00:13.620> deck<00:00:13.830> that's<00:00:14.040> been<00:00:14.190> helping<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.580> out

lately so I think I would just use the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.029 
lately so I think I would just use the
new<00:00:17.310> format<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.940> establish<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.830> this

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
new format to establish you know this

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.550
