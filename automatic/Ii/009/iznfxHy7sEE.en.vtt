00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
everything and then I've just got a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.350 
everything and then I've just got a
normal<00:02:15.920> npc<00:02:16.910> lady<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.260> from<00:02:18.470> town<00:02:18.740> but

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
normal npc lady here from town but

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.780 
normal npc lady here from town but
anyway<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:21.020> beside<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.709> point<00:02:22.069> just

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
anyway that's beside the point just

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.920 
anyway that's beside the point just
thought<00:02:22.910> i<00:02:22.940> would<00:02:23.030> point<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.420> out<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.780> case

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
thought i would point that out in case

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.970 
thought i would point that out in case
you're<00:02:24.080> wondering<00:02:24.140> why<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.650> he<00:02:24.830> being

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
you're wondering why is he being

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.180 
you're wondering why is he being
followed<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.630> essentially<00:02:27.020> crafting<00:02:27.830> we're

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
followed so essentially crafting we're

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.949 
followed so essentially crafting we're
basically<00:02:28.520> dealing<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.240> Heydrich<00:02:29.660> here

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
basically dealing with Heydrich here

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.990 
basically dealing with Heydrich here
there's<00:02:30.380> two<00:02:31.040> kind<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.430> things<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.820> do

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
there's two kind of things you can do

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.910 
there's two kind of things you can do
here<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.660> forge<00:02:32.900> armor<00:02:33.320> they<00:02:33.800> don't

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
here one is to forge armor they don't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.190 
here one is to forge armor they don't
want<00:02:34.040> us<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.190> forge<00:02:34.550> weapons<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.510> then

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
want us to forge weapons and then

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.010 
want us to forge weapons and then
basically<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.370> salvaging<00:02:38.090> weapons

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
basically you will be salvaging weapons

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.380 
basically you will be salvaging weapons
and<00:02:39.200> armor<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:40.070> get<00:02:40.220> essence<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.090> other

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and armor to get essence and other

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.430 
and armor to get essence and other
materials<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.230> craft<00:02:42.739> with<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:45.110> one

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
materials to craft with so there's one

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.350 
materials to craft with so there's one
kind<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.800> crafting<00:02:46.220> window<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.239> go

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
kind of crafting window but you can go

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.430 
kind of crafting window but you can go
up<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.540> any<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.780> these<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.080> we'll<00:02:48.140> open<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
up to any of these and we'll open that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.160 
up to any of these and we'll open that
specific<00:02:49.040> tab<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.480> come<00:02:50.660> up<00:02:50.690> here<00:02:50.989> and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
specific tab so if I come up here and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.930 
specific tab so if I come up here and
hit<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.410> salvage<00:02:51.890> you'll<00:02:52.070> see<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> salvaging

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
hit the salvage you'll see the salvaging

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.630 
hit the salvage you'll see the salvaging
tab<00:02:53.180> comes<00:02:53.540> up<00:02:53.840> here<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.890> we<00:02:54.980> also<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
tab comes up here but we also have the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.240 
tab comes up here but we also have the
forge<00:02:56.000> weapons<00:02:56.209> for<00:02:56.750> armor<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> actual

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
forge weapons for armor and actual

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.479 
forge weapons for armor and actual
training<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.410> I<00:03:00.410> don't<00:03:00.769> think<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> can<00:03:01.160> train

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
training so I don't think I can train

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.920 
training so I don't think I can train
anymore<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:02.510> where<00:03:02.660> we're<00:03:02.750> going<00:03:02.870> to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
anymore but that's where we're going to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.470 
anymore but that's where we're going to
start<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.850> I'm<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.030> level<00:03:05.300> one

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
start you can see that I'm a level one

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.300 
start you can see that I'm a level one
apprentice<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.290> tells<00:03:06.590> me<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.010> train

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
apprentice it tells me that if I train

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.830 
apprentice it tells me that if I train
I'm<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.760> experience<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.720> will

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I'm going to get experience and I will

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.380 
I'm going to get experience and I will
learn<00:03:08.989> new<00:03:09.200> recipes<00:03:09.830> in<00:03:10.459> fact<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.030> telling

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
learn new recipes in fact it's telling

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.240 
learn new recipes in fact it's telling
me<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:11.900> rewards<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.620> training<00:03:13.070> right

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
me that my rewards for training right

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.640 
me that my rewards for training right
now<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.850> were<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> train<00:03:14.390> would<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.320> these

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
now if I were to train would be these

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.340 
now if I were to train would be these
four<00:03:16.100> new<00:03:16.340> items<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.000> could<00:03:17.180> craft<00:03:17.480> you

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
four new items that I could craft you

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.080 
four new items that I could craft you
can<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.680> my<00:03:18.860> progress<00:03:19.220> towards<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.850> next

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
can see my progress towards the next

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.060 
can see my progress towards the next
level<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.570> here<00:03:21.380> you'll<00:03:21.530> see<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:21.920> costs

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
level and here you'll see that it costs

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.220 
level and here you'll see that it costs
four<00:03:22.310> thousand<00:03:22.910> gold<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.420> do<00:03:23.570> my<00:03:23.750> next<00:03:24.049> set<00:03:24.170> of

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
four thousand gold to do my next set of

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.620 
four thousand gold to do my next set of
training<00:03:24.530> at<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.280> point<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:25.790> I've<00:03:26.299> done

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
training at this point I think I've done

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.120 
training at this point I think I've done
probably<00:03:27.470> four<00:03:27.890> or<00:03:27.920> five<00:03:29.290> training<00:03:30.290> sessions

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
probably four or five training sessions

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.110 
probably four or five training sessions
to<00:03:31.459> get<00:03:31.610> here<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.350> anyway<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.640> kind<00:03:35.090> of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to get here so anyway that's kind of

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.460 
to get here so anyway that's kind of
gives<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.329> an<00:03:35.450> indication<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.049> cost<00:03:36.260> it

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
gives you an indication of the cost it

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.930 
gives you an indication of the cost it
initially<00:03:36.860> was<00:03:37.010> two<00:03:37.190> thousand<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.760> first

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
initially was two thousand the first

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.550 
initially was two thousand the first
couple<00:03:38.180> times<00:03:38.299> now<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.630> know<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.049> have<00:03:39.140> four

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
couple times now we know you have four

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.479 
couple times now we know you have four
thousand<00:03:40.209> but<00:03:41.209> yeah<00:03:41.690> let's<00:03:41.720> jump<00:03:42.079> in<00:03:42.170> here

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
thousand but yeah let's jump in here

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.800 
thousand but yeah let's jump in here

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
why not so essentially you can click

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.050 
why not so essentially you can click
this<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.830> two<00:04:57.949> ways<00:04:58.069> to<00:04:58.099> do<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.430> one<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:58.849> pick

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
this is two ways to do it one is to pick

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.760 
this is two ways to do it one is to pick
this<00:04:59.240> up<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.599> actually<00:04:59.750> drop<00:05:00.169> it<00:05:00.349> on<00:05:00.500> there

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
this up and actually drop it on there

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.499 
this up and actually drop it on there
the<00:05:01.220> much<00:05:01.400> faster<00:05:01.970> way<00:05:02.090> when<00:05:02.270> you've<00:05:02.389> got<00:05:02.449> a

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
the much faster way when you've got a

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.420 
the much faster way when you've got a
bunch<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.870> items<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.289> salvage<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:04.039> to<00:05:04.190> click

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
bunch of items to salvage is to click

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.980 
bunch of items to salvage is to click
this<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:04.849> you'll<00:05:04.970> get<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.120> selvedge<00:05:05.539> icon
