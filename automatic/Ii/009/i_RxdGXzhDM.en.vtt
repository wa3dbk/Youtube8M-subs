00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 this time I bring you what is the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 authentic story of godparents 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.440
 magical beings that have shown 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.080
 exist at all times in the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 imagination of a child unfortunately 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.009
 as all these stories we discover 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 that the reality behind the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.660
 magical godparents is much harder than 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 what we thought but harman 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 its creator was based on the real story 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.350
 of a child who was born with schizophrenia 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 paranoid imagining the existence of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.539
 the magical godfathers as a solution to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 the absence of his parents was admitted 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 in a psychiatric center where at 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 to be completely alone left that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 your imagination create your particular 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 fantasy world is what happened 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.860
 the longer he stayed there without 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 his parents the magical godfathers 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.730
 they became his point of support where 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.570
 the teacher to be what it would be 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 really a psychiatrist the when 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.860
 to be able to encourage the boy despite 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.870
 the few visits he received in his 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.360
 mind all his friends were still having 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.150
 11 years even seeing how they 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.950
 they grew and he himself did a story 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.630
 with a very hard ending that only us 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.970

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.130
 reality behind the fantasy the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 magical godparents have always been one of 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.330
 the most important series of our 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
 childhood where they have shown us what 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.410

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.110
 beings able to fulfill all your wishes 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.119
