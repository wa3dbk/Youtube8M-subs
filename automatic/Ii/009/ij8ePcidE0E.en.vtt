00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
otterbox case otterbox is known for

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.360 
otterbox case otterbox is known for
making<00:00:21.940> very<00:00:22.360> rugged<00:00:22.660> cases<00:00:23.320> this<00:00:23.950> is<00:00:24.810> rated

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
making very rugged cases this is rated

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.680 
making very rugged cases this is rated
three<00:00:27.370> out<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:27.940> four<00:00:28.720> on<00:00:28.990> ruggedness<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.970> 44

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
three out of four on ruggedness the 44

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.389 
three out of four on ruggedness the 44
is<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.960> defender<00:00:32.439> case<00:00:32.680> is<00:00:33.010> much<00:00:33.190> more

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
is the defender case is much more

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.420 
is the defender case is much more
expensive<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.780> which<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.110> also<00:00:35.320> bulkier<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.399> I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
expensive but which is also bulkier so I

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.850 
expensive but which is also bulkier so I
do<00:00:36.820> not<00:00:37.059> recommend<00:00:37.390> that<00:00:37.719> this<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.829> a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
do not recommend that this is a

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.149 
do not recommend that this is a
nice-size<00:00:39.850> pretty<00:00:40.719> slim<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.710> gives<00:00:41.949> you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
nice-size pretty slim and it gives you

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.639 
nice-size pretty slim and it gives you
quite<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.820> lot<00:00:42.909> of<00:00:43.120> protection<00:00:43.629> let's<00:00:44.320> just<00:00:44.499> get

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
quite a lot of protection let's just get

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.349 
quite a lot of protection let's just get
started<00:00:44.829> right<00:00:45.339> on<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:46.449> unboxing<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:48.359> you

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
started right on the unboxing so you

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.270 
started right on the unboxing so you
just<00:00:49.510> pull<00:00:49.839> this<00:00:50.019> little<00:00:50.170> black<00:00:50.559> thing<00:00:50.920> out

and get back to the case now comes in
two<00:01:51.070> parts<00:01:51.310> one<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.920> rubbery<00:01:54.120> silicon

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
two parts one is the rubbery silicon

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.940 
two parts one is the rubbery silicon
part<00:01:55.800> just<00:01:56.800> like<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.040> regular<00:01:57.310> rubber<00:01:57.700> silicon

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
part just like a regular rubber silicon

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
part just like a regular rubber silicon
case<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.250> then<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> second<00:02:01.150> part<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.540> a<00:02:01.800> hard

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and put the case on so you first put the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.410 
and put the case on so you first put the
eight<00:02:13.360> inside<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.409> silicon<00:02:15.069> part

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.720 

and<00:02:19.670> once<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.810> take<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.489> hard<00:02:23.489> shell

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
and once it's in you take the hard shell

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
here they've managed to make it look

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.530 
here they've managed to make it look
very<00:02:41.790> good<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.270> says<00:02:42.510> otterbox<00:02:44.120> still<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
very good it says otterbox still see the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.900 
very good it says otterbox still see the
camera<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:49.739> front<00:02:50.069> doesn't<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.670> much

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
camera there the front doesn't have much

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.590 
camera there the front doesn't have much
protection<00:02:51.330> though<00:02:51.660> just<00:02:51.989> has<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> ridges

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
protection though just has the ridges
