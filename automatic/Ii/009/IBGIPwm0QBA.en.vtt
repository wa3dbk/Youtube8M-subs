00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we're going to start with our pry tool

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.620 
we're going to start with our pry tool
this<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:29.920> very<00:00:30.369> simple<00:00:30.820> stereo<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.390> get<00:00:31.510> out

and all these clips on this panel
release<00:00:41.620> with<00:00:41.860> pry<00:00:42.129> pressure<00:00:42.520> I'm<00:00:43.390> going<00:00:43.629> to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
release with pry pressure I'm going to

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.360 
release with pry pressure I'm going to
pull<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.930> handle<00:00:44.230> up<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.620> release<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:44.949> now

pull the handle up and release it now
this<00:00:46.269> also<00:00:46.510> has<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.129> passenger<00:00:48.129> airbag<00:00:48.610> light

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
this also has the passenger airbag light

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.799 
this also has the passenger airbag light
on<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:50.470> suggest<00:00:51.460> no<00:00:52.269> turning<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
on it and I suggest no turning the

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.229 
on it and I suggest no turning the
ignition<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.409> no<00:00:54.100> removing<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.760> connector

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
ignition on no removing this connector

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.049 
ignition on no removing this connector
because<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:55.750> can<00:00:55.989> bring<00:00:56.500> up<00:00:56.650> a<00:00:56.769> false<00:00:57.059> pass

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
because this can bring up a false pass

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.780 
because this can bring up a false pass
an<00:00:58.299> air<00:00:58.479> passenger<00:00:59.229> airbag<00:00:59.650> light<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.190> then

you have to go to the dealership to have

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.079 
you have to go to the dealership to have

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
them program the car to turn that light

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.010

there<00:02:02.380> are<00:02:02.499> several<00:02:02.740> antenna<00:02:03.219> connectors<00:02:03.819> and

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
there are several antenna connectors and

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.370 
there are several antenna connectors and
usually<00:02:04.270> there's<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> little<00:02:04.630> trigger<00:02:05.049> on<00:02:05.259> the

usually there's a little trigger on the
connectors<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.850> locate<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> trigger

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
connectors and you locate that trigger

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.970 
connectors and you locate that trigger
and<00:02:08.289> push<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.360> releases<00:02:13.980> releases

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and push it in and it releases releases

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.760 
and push it in and it releases releases
the<00:02:15.960> antennas<00:02:18.750> there<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.840> go<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.590> this

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the antennas there we go on on this

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.670 
the antennas there we go on on this
specific<00:02:21.540> antenna<00:02:22.540> lead<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.170> trigger<00:02:23.470> is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
specific antenna lead the trigger is

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.950 
specific antenna lead the trigger is
back<00:02:24.069> here<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.550> right<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.840> do

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
back here on the right and what you do

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.289 
back here on the right and what you do
is<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.230> grasp<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.860> edge<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.549> pull<00:02:28.150> it

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
is you grasp the edge of it and pull it

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.630 
is you grasp the edge of it and pull it
down<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:29.319> releases<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> latch<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.459> allows

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
down this releases the latch and allows

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.710 
down this releases the latch and allows
you<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:31.060> remove<00:02:31.330> this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
you to remove this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
you to remove this
the<00:02:31.780> antenna<00:02:32.140> because<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.680> releases<00:02:32.950> though

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the antenna because it releases though

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.730 
the antenna because it releases though
the<00:02:33.880> hook<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.360> again<00:02:35.110> when<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.380> put<00:02:35.410> the

the hook on it again when you put the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.500 
the hook on it again when you put the
antenna<00:02:36.190> back<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.880> push<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:37.270> little

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
antenna back on you push this little

antenna back on you push this little
piece<00:02:37.810> back<00:02:38.050> up<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.470> lock<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.920> place

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
piece back up to lock it in place

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.100 
piece back up to lock it in place
this<00:02:41.020> works<00:02:41.260> Ralia<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:43.150> antennas<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.900> this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
this works Ralia the antennas on this

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.010 
this works Ralia the antennas on this
one<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.670> two<00:02:45.820> antennas<00:02:46.330> on<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.480> bottom<00:02:46.840> have

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
one the two antennas on the bottom have

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.600 
one the two antennas on the bottom have
the<00:02:47.170> regular<00:02:47.560> trigger<00:02:47.860> where<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.190> push<00:02:48.430> this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the regular trigger where you push this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.600 
the regular trigger where you push this
trigger<00:02:48.910> down<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.510> releases<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.170> removes

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
trigger down and it releases and removes

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.280 
trigger down and it releases and removes
now<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> main<00:02:51.880> connector<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:52.960> is<00:02:53.230> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
now the main connector on this one is a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.590 
now the main connector on this one is a
bit<00:02:53.620> tricky<00:02:56.820> again<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.940> main<00:02:58.090> connector<00:02:58.510> on

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
bit tricky again the main connector on

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.680 
bit tricky again the main connector on
this<00:02:58.750> one<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.020> bit<00:02:59.230> tricky<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.740> has<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> swivel

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
this one is a bit tricky it has a swivel

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.610 
this one is a bit tricky it has a swivel
connector<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.810> there's<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.990> little<00:03:02.230> trigger

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
connector and there's a little trigger

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.199 
connector and there's a little trigger
that's<00:03:02.890> here<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> side<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.460> you<00:03:03.760> squeeze

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
that's here on the side that you squeeze

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.470 
that's here on the side that you squeeze
this<00:03:05.140> releases<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.860> latch<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.580> this<00:03:07.209> latch

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
this releases this latch and this latch

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.560 
this releases this latch and this latch
will<00:03:08.190> push<00:03:09.190> down<00:03:09.459> over<00:03:09.790> because<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.240> radio

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
will push down over because this radio

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.990 
will push down over because this radio
is<00:03:10.690> coated<00:03:11.170> today<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> don't<00:03:12.310> want<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.520> remove
