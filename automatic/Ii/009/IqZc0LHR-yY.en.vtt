00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.749
 I am very good all because javier 10 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.129
 I'm with a new video of whites 2 and 

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:08.620
 today I come to bring you a little trick 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.030
 one sure that you know already but one 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.800
 little trick so they do not take away the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.140
 packages so easy that surely 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.519
 work a little harder and in the first place 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.010
 we have to take out the help package now 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.060
 You see, I'm about to do it and 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.160
 here I am going to catch this poor man 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.869
 clueless I was looking at nothing 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 and there I already have the help package but 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.380
 what am I going to do instead of throwing it inside 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.119
 I'm going to throw it out there 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.970
 little of jose in a totally 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.439
 invisible to everyone else you go to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.550
 see that my filippa partner stays 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.649
 there looking like saying but you've 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.110
 made miserable but what a shame it was 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.520
 I was going to try to save him he's going to say no 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.710
 do not worry we're going to lose you 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.140
 saved do not worry I do not take it then not 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.969
 and finally he took it and I with the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.410
 half black hat carry and totally 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.300
 sure without any danger that I would 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.980
 remove but well let's complicate a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.360
 little more because someone can think 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.460
 about a game that I have 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.570
 thrown a little close to the best is that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.680
 it has a somewhat limited reach and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.390
 you can ever play it 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.399
 Well, I'm going to take out the other package and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.559
 we keep trying and you see that I already have 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.030
 a hunter is missing everything and takes a knife 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.520
 happens that I will give it is in the whole face 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.420
 is already a package of help and this time 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.850
 I'm going to throw at a distance 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.710
 a little older does not happen I will 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.729
 to add here for the balcony and I think that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.040
 the circle is fine that is a 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.149
 average distance how good it is is 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 if now the enemy killed him 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.990
 from behind he would be stunned not 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.000
 would know what to do and would surely happen 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.290
 of him because I up to now I so 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.880
 least I have not found many people who 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.950
 wear a hat in black and less still 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.090
 that they know very well how to use it and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.799
 it's going to be the package I'll get it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.049
 catch it yes and let's complicate it 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.610
 still a little bit more the third and 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.960
 last challenge that is going to be pulling what 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.090
 farther because the farthest 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.289
 allow to pull the doll for it and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.970
 Like the other times I have to take out 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.950
 through the package I have it close no 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.770
 I'm going to catch this one and there 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.929
 is the package they kill me but it gives me 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.909
 same as the other thin mapre this time what 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.580
 as far as possible there is with the greatest 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.740
 possible angle to see where it falls I think 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.240
 that has not happened to the best a little there 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.240
 is the plane with my help package going 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.649
 to fall and has fallen exactly on top of 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.350
 that kind of bridge that communicates the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.369
 two buildings I'll get to take it 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.679
 truth is that it may have happened to me 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.060
 a little bit I'm going to throw before hunter and 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.800
 I see that he is seeing an enemy I do not give myself 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.300
 account at that time 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.150
 comes the enemy kill before but I 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.980
 kill the and what's good about this then that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.690
 the enemy can already put in if he wants 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090
 my package is going to be there the only thing 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.380
 you have to know if you could catch it it seems 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.820
 that if you can catch it so you know 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.710
 Pull the package as far as possible 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.070
 to ensure a single all and even 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.070
 another goodbye
