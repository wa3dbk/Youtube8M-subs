00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.610
 How about friends of people beta mexico 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.579
 and today I want to show you a finger of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.910
 those who failed 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.850
 the first week 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.500
 died and right now I made the change of 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.250
 Water 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.900
 I took it from the bottom since the fry 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.090
 that die almost always remain 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.340
 stuck in the aquarium where the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.550
 we put to create 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.170
 and I want to show you the great amount of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.100
 organisms that are feeding off 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.350
 of the alevÃ­n 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.350
 ay rotifers for media 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.450
 even that one that is in the middle 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.250
 stretching and if I do not know what it is I'm going to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.480
 ask to see what 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.310
 what body is 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.150
 and now I'm going to show you a little 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.180
 more closely to see the whole world 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.610
 microscopic that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.670
 that at first sight we do not 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.960
 we can see but it is inside 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.960
 our aquariums 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.880
 and what we can see is the 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.850
 juvenile jaw 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.119
 and there we see as two or three parameters 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.820
 that are feeding on the membrane 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.509
 of the eye I think what they are 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.509
 eating right now 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.509
 we see a lot of organisms that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.760
 that are the ones that scavengers 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.300
 they feed on anything 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.350
 microalgae organic matter excreta 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.350
 of the fish 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.380
 imagine if this is an aquarium of 7 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.750
 days 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.760
 imagine an aquarium that is not cleaned 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.060
 that does not have water changes followed 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.250
 provoke 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.580
 these organisms are not pathogenic for 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.099
 the alevinos but later with high 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.040
 contaminations are generated others 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.650
 organisms that are the ones that affect the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.960
 water quality and I say are the ones that 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.780
 affect the health of the fish 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.780
 they end up killing him 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.760
 this these little organisms because they are 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.300
 beneficial for 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.730
 for the aquarium since you can 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.730
 are the ones in charge of disintegrating 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.940
 in this case the bodies of the fry 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.440
 that were not achieved 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.570
 but well, it seems very 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.380
 interesting and I wanted to share the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.370
 video of all these organisms that to 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.370
 simple view is not seen 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:34.060
 all these organisms are 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.060
 because those who remained left us 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.430
 of the food ration that gives them 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.329
 night 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.319
 they are from the strain of the cultivation of inf 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.680
 users that I feed the a 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.680
 the fry and then in this case this 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.630
 beta no longer with me no longer eat them 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.270
 infusers now 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.290
 the 100 users finished by eating 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.200
 to the corpse of the beta 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.850
 unfortunately he did not succeed what the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.340
 week 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.400
 but here we see all these organisms 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.660
 what 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.590
 they are very interesting they have many 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.590
 structures 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.289
 then they will end esteve 'tito'
