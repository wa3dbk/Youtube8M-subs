00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and i can think about some nice uses

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130 
and i can think about some nice uses
product<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:47.250> example<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:48.329> many<00:01:48.600> times<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
product for example how many times have

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.630 
product for example how many times have
you<00:01:49.170> guys<00:01:49.439> wives<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.579> low

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.970 
because this is important this speed
always<00:04:33.940> mattered<00:04:34.330> in<00:04:34.480> this<00:04:34.630> game<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.320> we<00:04:35.740> have

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
always mattered in this game is we have

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.900 
always mattered in this game is we have
to<00:04:36.250> clean<00:04:36.670> we<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.380> induce<00:04:38.380> from<00:04:39.310> Amy<00:04:39.550> dps

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
to clean we have to induce from Amy dps

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.150 
to clean we have to induce from Amy dps
in<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.480> game<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.900> speed<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.380> one<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.070> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
in this game the speed is one of the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.530 
in this game the speed is one of the
most<00:04:42.310> important<00:04:42.820> factors<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.240> take<00:04:43.390> into

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
most important factors to take into

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.850 
most important factors to take into
consideration<00:04:44.440> though<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.160> was<00:04:45.460> wondering<00:04:45.880> and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
consideration though I was wondering and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.830 
consideration though I was wondering and
what's<00:04:47.860> going<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.430> time<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.090> switch

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
what's going to be the time to switch

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
what's going to be the time to switch
between<00:04:49.990> aspects<00:04:50.620> because<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> time<00:04:51.430> for

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
between aspects because if the time for

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.580 
between aspects because if the time for
switching<00:04:52.510> between<00:04:52.600> aspects<00:04:53.170> is<00:04:53.260> too<00:04:53.410> high

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
switching between aspects is too high

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.220 
switching between aspects is too high
then<00:04:53.830> maybe<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:54.610> not<00:04:54.700> work<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:57.960> basically<00:04:58.960> I

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
then maybe it's not work so basically I

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.100 
then maybe it's not work so basically I
hope<00:04:59.950> there's<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.150> be<00:05:01.180> some<00:05:01.660> kind<00:05:01.900> of

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
hope there's going to be some kind of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.580 
hope there's going to be some kind of
control<00:05:02.590> when<00:05:03.030> dr<00:05:04.030> risk<00:05:04.360> because<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.200> depths

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
control when dr risk because the depths

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.560 
control when dr risk because the depths
can<00:05:05.800> really<00:05:06.100> break<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.730> balance<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.480> you

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
can really break little balance and you

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.320 
can really break little balance and you
still<00:05:07.810> have<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.230> game<00:05:08.380> right<00:05:08.590> now<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.640> what<00:05:10.060> I

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
still have the game right now and what I

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.540

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
also the sign if they're some of the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.710 
also the sign if they're some of the
uses<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:23.020> guys<00:05:23.230> would<00:05:23.470> eat<00:05:23.680> them<00:05:24.420> this<00:05:25.420> is<00:05:25.570> all
