00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.210
 news and bad news 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.119
 in relation to the jailbreak in the last 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.200
 version of ios 7.1 point 1 we are going to 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.610
 start a little bit for the good no 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.590
 maybe it's the most interesting thing not for 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.090
 start good things not good 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.329
 guys let's talk about the jailbreak 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.399
 on the iphone 4 with ios 7.1 point 1 as 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.260
 I tell you the latest available version of 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.150
 this is currently not the truth is that 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.570
 last weekend the popular 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.370
 hacker win 12m uploaded a video to his channel 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.740
 from YouTube where he showed us that he had 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.840
 the jailbreak on iphone 4 and in May the 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.120
 7.1 point 1 and will also be the tie-break 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 before 3 this thermal that we can restart 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.240
 without any problem 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.710
 the other gilbert who is the bad the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.570
 teatret with which we do 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.160
 we can enjoy you all 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.780
 the tweets without any problem but 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.310
 when we turn off the device there 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.050
 we can turn it on again because it 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.610
 is in the block this is because the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 free that is 13 to turn it on 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.329
 we need to connect it to the computer and 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.760
 redo the jailbreak process 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.310
 not in this way we would have a 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.890
 before 13 I would also like to emphasize that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.620
 the final iphone4 has exploits of 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.390
 hardware and apple can not cover any 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.700
 hardware exploit with none 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.490
 update therefore we always go 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 to be able to jailbreak in ios with 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.790
 the iphone 4 the truth is that many 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.530
 Sometimes we are surprised we are not already 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 always available for iphone 4 but at 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.400
 final is the natural thing because it is going 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.440
 always be able to jailbreak 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 this terminal to the iphone4 concrete like 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.380
 I say no good this is the good 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.820
 news seems fantastic to me because 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.310
 iphone 4 users will be able to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.020
 enjoy the jailbreak surely not 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.700
 inside a lot but on the other hand 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.160
 we're also going to talk a little bit about the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.260
 bad news let's start talking 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.120
 by the beginning we are not going to talk about 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.070
 hacker and onic that this weekend 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.930
 also on Sunday at the last minute of the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.630
 night in Spain at least one rose 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.210
 tweet saying that I had the jailbreak in 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 ios 7.1 point 1 and I had it on an iphone 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.290
 5 c the truth is that this may seem 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.820
 very good news does not seem that in fact 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.560
 the gear therefore soon what 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.230
 we will have available not also 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.910
 remember that the hacker pont 22 g that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.960
 is one of the guys from and partners the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.490
 they are doing it 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.440
 the tools to do the jailbreak 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.110
 lately he also said he was 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.910
 working in the servef for ios 7.1 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.070
 point 1 but possibly not us 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.630
 I would take out until we were 8 years old 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.150
 available not the certain thing is that yes that 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.490
 we can trust this points that but 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.340
 We can not trust Johnny and I tell you 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.590
 because if I nick has the jailbreak 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 I'll probably treat you before three I do not know 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.510
 it is not known simply yorick published a 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 tweet where he told us that he left here 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.000
 this guy estimating a picture of a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.260
 iphone 5 c in ios 7.1 point 1 and with the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 jailbreak but I say we can not 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.350
 legit of johnny because the truth is that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.600
 this exploit with which he has made the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.450
 jailbreak in this supposed iphone 5 what 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.090
 has a long time ago years ago is a 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.320
 exploit that has not yet covered and apple 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.590
 The truth is that it is an exploit of 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.750
 software and he has it for him that's his 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.780
 jailbreak will not open it for all 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.720
 world this gentleman and now says that those 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.280
 ios users are unintelligent and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.530
 also that they are heavy because he is 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.630
 with we are constantly saying that 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.490
 remove the level please his exploit 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.020
 so that we can all enjoy that 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.770
 time he has but does not want 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.530
 do what 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.210
 this gentleman is limited to publish tweets 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.530
 of this style according to the 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.970
 jailbreak and such from time to time 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.100
 little to get attention and about 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.990
 everything to poke ios users 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.670
 then guys at the end we have a 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.800
 good news we have the jailbreak 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 untethered on the iphone 4 and on the last 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.000
 version of ios 7.1 point one that still 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.010
 it is not known when it will come out that it has 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.960
 done win 12m that this guy me so 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 least I left a little more of him but 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.250
 then we have the bad news we have 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.780
 that there is jailbreak for iphone 5 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.690
 And I understand that for 5 and 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 possibly also for 5 s but not 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.100
 will release it because this one is johnny 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.990
 that is from an exploit of yours that is not going to 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.370
 market in some new way by 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.440
 at least make public better said 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.330
 because all he wants is to call the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.730
 attention and provoke the users of 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.100
 ios historically has done so well 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.840
 what are you guys waiting for? 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.670
 soon a jailbreak on it the 7.1 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.530
 point one for any terminal 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.390
 it is to have a little patience 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.459
 because surely we will not see it 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.930
 I may still have made a mistake 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.180
 We'll see to see maybe I changed him 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.610
 opinion and liberalize it but I doubt 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.840
 I'm going to make you guys good 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.860
 this has been the news today I hope 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.780
 that you liked the report 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.580
 If so, can you support us with a good 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.710
 I like it and nothing that we see in a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.159
 next video and on eisenach dot net 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.159
 bye
