00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
use the toaster only once a week if at
all<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.630> would<00:03:05.720> hardly<00:03:05.870> call<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.380> playing

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
all and I would hardly call that playing

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.010 
all and I would hardly call that playing
but<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> guess<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.700> master<00:03:08.030> did<00:03:08.420> play<00:03:08.750> with<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
but I guess the master did play with the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.740 
but I guess the master did play with the
toaster<00:03:09.460> sort<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.330> only<00:03:11.450> appliance

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
toaster sort of but the only appliance

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.600 
toaster sort of but the only appliance
that's<00:03:12.140> really<00:03:12.410> shaken<00:03:12.830> up<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.190> blanket

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
that's really shaken up is the blanket

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.030 
that's really shaken up is the blanket
and<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.270> makes<00:03:14.510> sense<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.830> master

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
and that makes sense because the master

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.680 
and that makes sense because the master
actually<00:03:16.610> would<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.880> cuddled<00:03:17.240> with<00:03:17.300> him<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
actually would have cuddled with him and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.630 
actually would have cuddled with him and
stuff<00:03:17.960> honestly<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.920> blanket<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.400> real

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
stuff honestly the blanket is the real

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.950
