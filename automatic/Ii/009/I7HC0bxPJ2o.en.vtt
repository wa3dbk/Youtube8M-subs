00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
and this one as you can see the drum to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
and this one as you can see the drum to
your<00:00:30.840> slides<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.349> forth<00:00:31.790> which<00:00:32.790> will

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
your slides back and forth which will

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
your slides back and forth which will
let<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.180> accommodate<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.020> 12-inch<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
let it accommodate a 12-inch to a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.889 
let it accommodate a 12-inch to a
14-inch<00:00:35.760> drum<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> here's<00:00:37.680> how<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> works<00:00:38.040> we

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
14-inch drum so here's how it works we

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.060 
14-inch drum so here's how it works we
just<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.460> set<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
just kind of set it down here and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
just kind of set it down here and
roughly<00:00:44.070> align<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> tuning<00:00:47.219> peg<00:00:48.500> once<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
roughly align the tuning peg once you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
roughly align the tuning peg once you
get<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> close<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.500> crank<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
get it close you can kind of crank it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
get it close you can kind of crank it
and<00:00:53.699> it'll<00:00:54.030> sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> seat<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.899> place<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and it'll sort of seat in place you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
and it'll sort of seat in place you
could<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.620> push<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.829> down<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.270> ready

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
could just push it down now you're ready

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.250 
could just push it down now you're ready
to<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.960> drum<00:00:58.170> pedal<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> while<00:01:00.930> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to take your drum pedal and while it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.670 
to take your drum pedal and while it's
doing<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.800> cranking<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.899> yes<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> pro

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
doing that cranking it yes I'm a pro

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
doing that cranking it yes I'm a pro
drummer<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.970> still<00:01:06.840> use<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.439> occasion

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
drummer and I still use this on occasion

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
drummer and I still use this on occasion
but<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> reason<00:01:08.280> why<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.760> use<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but the reason why I don't use it now is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
but the reason why I don't use it now is
because<00:01:09.630> we've<00:01:10.110> invented<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> instead

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
because we've invented this and instead

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.260 
because we've invented this and instead
of<00:01:12.270> doing<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.750> each<00:01:13.400> individually<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.939> does

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of doing this each individually now does

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
of doing this each individually now does
it<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.780> once<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.830> cuts<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it all at once and it cuts down the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
it all at once and it cuts down the
tuning<00:01:17.820> time<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.600> attend<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
tuning time to attend that the time it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.200 
tuning time to attend that the time it
takes<00:01:19.909> now<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.479> drummers<00:01:21.990> using<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
takes now you know drummers using this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.460 
takes now you know drummers using this
looks<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.509> getting<00:01:24.659> close<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.110> the

help me I put that bag knowledge okay so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
help me I put that bag knowledge okay so
when<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> put<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
when you put it back on you just kind of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
when you put it back on you just kind of
roughly<00:01:39.409> align<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.130> pegs<00:01:41.450> just<00:01:42.450> make

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
roughly align the two pegs just make

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
roughly align the two pegs just make
sure<00:01:42.630> they're<00:01:42.899> seated<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.560> necessarily

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
sure they're seated don't necessarily

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.950 
sure they're seated don't necessarily
need<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.729> screw<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> can

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.750 

and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.890> repeating<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
and it's basically just repeating the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.980 
and it's basically just repeating the
process<00:01:55.880> there<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.150> now<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.570> time<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.840> put

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
process there we go now it's time to put

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.470 
process there we go now it's time to put
it<00:01:58.080> back<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.040> while<00:01:59.700> Pete's<00:02:00.000> doin<00:02:00.240> lives

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
it back on and while Pete's doin lives

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.990 
it back on and while Pete's doin lives
hmm<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.230> beauty<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.650> this<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:02.010> it's<00:02:02.850> got

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
hmm the beauty of this is that it's got

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
hmm the beauty of this is that it's got
a<00:02:03.150> torque<00:02:04.140> mechanism<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.070> such<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
a torque mechanism in here such that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.450 
a torque mechanism in here such that
when<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.720> get<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> desire<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.130> fine

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
when you get to the desire it's fine

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.880 
when you get to the desire it's fine
tuning<00:02:08.910> range<00:02:09.210> then<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.350> these<00:02:10.590> start

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
tuning range then all these start

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310 
tuning range then all these start
cooking<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.520> movie<00:02:11.790> stops<00:02:12.300> turning<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
cooking which movie stops turning it and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.430 
cooking which movie stops turning it and
we've<00:02:14.100> achieved<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.760> perfect<00:02:15.570> torque<00:02:15.840> which

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
we've achieved the perfect torque which
