00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
basically said fast paced programming

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840 
basically said fast paced programming
can<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.890> affect<00:00:38.370> what's<00:00:38.640> called

skills that really govern how we behave
and<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:47.760> abilities<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> involves<00:00:48.750> working

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and our abilities it involves working

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
and our abilities it involves working

gratification problem solving all the
things<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.270> need<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> function<00:00:54.930> well

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
things we really need to function well

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
things we really need to function well
and<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.829> study<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.190> looked<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.579> sixty

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and in this study they looked at sixty

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
and in this study they looked at sixty
four<00:00:57.600> year-olds<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.140> broke<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.559> into

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
four year-olds they broke them into

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
four year-olds they broke them into
three<00:00:59.309> different<00:00:59.460> groups<00:00:59.730> where<00:01:00.329> basically

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
three different groups where basically

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
three different groups where basically
one<00:01:01.050> group<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.289> watching<00:01:01.739> quote-unquote

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
one group was watching quote-unquote

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
one group was watching quote-unquote
fast-paced<00:01:03.030> television<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:04.080> group<00:01:04.260> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
fast-paced television one group was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410 
fast-paced television one group was
watching<00:01:04.890> slower<00:01:05.189> paced<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.820> realistic

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
watching slower paced more realistic

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
watching slower paced more realistic
television<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> third<00:01:07.680> group<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.950> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
television and the third group was just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
television and the third group was just
drawing<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.970> did<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.119> tell<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.420> after

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
drawing and what did they tell you after

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
drawing and what did they tell you after
that<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.530> found<00:01:10.680> after<00:01:11.040> nine<00:01:11.280> minutes<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that so they found after nine minutes of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
that so they found after nine minutes of
one<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.270> activities<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
one of these activities that the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
one of these activities that the
executive<00:01:13.979> function<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:14.580> decreased<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
executive function was decreased in the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.670 
executive function was decreased in the
group<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> watched<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> fast-paced

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
group that watched the fast-paced

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
group that watched the fast-paced
television<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.939> affected<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> group

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
television but not affected in the group

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
television but not affected in the group
that<00:01:18.990> either<00:01:19.290> watched<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> solar<00:01:20.009> paste<00:01:20.310> or

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
that either watched the solar paste or

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
that either watched the solar paste or
did<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> drawing<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.869> talking<00:01:22.200> about

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
did the drawing are we talking about

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.010 
did the drawing are we talking about
long-term<00:01:22.979> impact<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
long-term impact there well that's the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
long-term impact there well that's the
interesting<00:01:25.200> question<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.130> study<00:01:26.369> only

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
interesting question this study only

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
interesting question this study only
looked<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> immediate<00:01:27.750> time<00:01:27.990> after<00:01:28.500> they

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
looked at the immediate time after they

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.260 
looked at the immediate time after they
watched<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> television<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
watched the television but you know the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
watched the television but you know the
question<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.840> does<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.380> long-term

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
question is does this have long-term

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
question is does this have long-term
effects<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.729> studies<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.210> certainly

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
effects and other studies have certainly

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
effects and other studies have certainly
shown<00:01:34.229> television<00:01:34.799> watching<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.280> children

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
shown television watching for children

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
shown television watching for children
can<00:01:36.060> affect<00:01:36.390> long-term<00:01:36.570> school<00:01:37.140> performance

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
can affect long-term school performance

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.620 
can affect long-term school performance
attention<00:01:38.189> problems<00:01:38.549> even<00:01:38.820> lead<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> obesity

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
attention problems even lead to obesity

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
attention problems even lead to obesity
so<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.829> there's<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> very<00:01:41.460> good

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so you know there there's a very good

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.219 
so you know there there's a very good

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
so maybe these cartoons these programs

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.610 
so maybe these cartoons these programs
just<00:03:21.150> reflect<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.959> hear<00:03:22.199> this<00:03:22.319> argument
