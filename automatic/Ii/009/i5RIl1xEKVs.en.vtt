00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that the strategy in Iraq called the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.660 
that the strategy in Iraq called the
surge<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.500> succeeded<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
surge has succeeded but what you see I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.100 
surge has succeeded but what you see I
be<00:00:41.910> saying<00:00:42.120> there<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.840> about

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
be saying there is that it's all about

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.260 
be saying there is that it's all about
personal<00:00:43.530> ambition<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.190> him<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:45.000> about

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
personal ambition for him and not about

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.729 
personal ambition for him and not about
what<00:00:45.450> he<00:00:45.600> honestly<00:00:45.930> thinks<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
what he honestly thinks is right for the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
what he honestly thinks is right for the
country<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.940> believe<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> any

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
country I do not believe that any

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.950 
country I do not believe that any
objective<00:00:49.289> observer<00:00:49.940> can<00:00:50.940> conclude<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
objective observer can conclude that the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
objective observer can conclude that the
surge<00:00:52.199> did<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.860> work<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.670> should<00:00:53.879> know

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
surge did not work and he should know

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.100 
surge did not work and he should know
better<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.480> he<00:00:54.629> wants<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> be

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
better if he wants to be

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
better if he wants to be
commander-in-chief<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.129> certainly<00:00:56.940> behave

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
commander-in-chief and certainly behave

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.250 
commander-in-chief and certainly behave
differently<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.260> far<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.719> our<00:01:00.719> presence

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
differently as far as this our presence

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
differently as far as this our presence
and<00:01:01.500> our<00:01:02.010> strategy<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> Iraq<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and our strategy in Iraq but it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
and our strategy in Iraq but it
sometimes<00:01:03.660> seems<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.589> outside<00:01:04.949> observer

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
sometimes seems as an outside observer

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
sometimes seems as an outside observer
that<00:01:05.610> both<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.299> guys<00:01:06.619> sometimes<00:01:07.619> get

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that both of you guys sometimes get

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.590 
that both of you guys sometimes get
stuck<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> past<00:01:08.520> senator<00:01:09.000> Obama<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.420> kind

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of stuck in 2003 and whether the war was

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
of stuck in 2003 and whether the war was
a<00:01:12.360> good<00:01:12.990> idea<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> first<00:01:13.530> place<00:01:13.799> yeah<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
a good idea in the first place yeah and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.120 
a good idea in the first place yeah and
you<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> seem<00:01:15.450> stuck<00:01:15.720> sometimes<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.290> 2007

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you kind of seem stuck sometimes in 2007

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
you kind of seem stuck sometimes in 2007
and<00:01:17.250> whether<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.909> surge<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> right

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and whether the surge was the right

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
and whether the surge was the right
strategy<00:01:19.439> shouldn't<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.250> debate<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:21.000> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
strategy shouldn't this debate really be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
strategy shouldn't this debate really be
about<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.320> future<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> where<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.610> from

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
about the future and where we go from

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
about the future and where we go from
here<00:01:23.850> oh<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.659> exactly<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.770> all

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
here oh you're exactly right it's all

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
here oh you're exactly right it's all
about<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> future<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> future<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:28.320> my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
about the future and the future in my

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010 
about the future and the future in my
view<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.460> succeeded<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.780> still

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
view we have succeeded but it's still

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
view we have succeeded but it's still
fragile<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.890> yourself<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.119> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
fragile you yourself as it is that we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
fragile you yourself as it is that we
are<00:01:33.420> responsible<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> our<00:01:34.439> records<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.220> was

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
are responsible for our records I was

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.149 
are responsible for our records I was
right<00:01:36.060> senator<00:01:36.630> Obama<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.290> wrong<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
right senator Obama was wrong so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.730 
right senator Obama was wrong so
therefore<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.090> think<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.439> more

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
therefore I think that I have more

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
therefore I think that I have more
credibility<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> future<00:01:42.659> should<00:01:42.689> be

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
credibility on what the future should be

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.770 
credibility on what the future should be
as<00:01:43.409> opposed<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.399> Senator<00:01:44.700> Obama<00:01:45.000> who<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.600> he'd

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
as opposed to Senator Obama who if he'd

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.800 
as opposed to Senator Obama who if he'd
had<00:01:46.020> his<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.829> would<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.250> very<00:01:47.460> likely<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
had his way we would be very likely be
