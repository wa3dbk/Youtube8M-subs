00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
into the sacred burial ground so it's I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
into the sacred burial ground so it's I
have<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> assume<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.200> obvious<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
have to assume that it's obvious that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
have to assume that it's obvious that
you<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> burial<00:01:33.090> ground

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

you get into the into the burial ground
in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> backswing<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
in the backswing and so we know that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.490 
in the backswing and so we know that
we're<00:01:36.450> supposed<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
we're supposed to go back into the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.899 
we're supposed to go back into the
catcher's<00:01:37.860> mitt<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> tree<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.790> if

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
catcher's mitt and up to tree and but if

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.280 
catcher's mitt and up to tree and but if
we<00:01:42.030> turn<00:01:42.270> too<00:01:42.509> much<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
we turn too much and we get in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
we turn too much and we get in the
sacred<00:01:43.649> burial<00:01:43.920> ground<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.820> only<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
can happen to get back to impact is we

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.590 
can happen to get back to impact is we
have<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> come<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.640> around<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> body<00:01:48.329> which

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
have to come back around the body which

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.469 
have to come back around the body which
is<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.729> turning<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.820> shoulders<00:01:51.149> too<00:01:51.299> much

which eventually is caused by starting

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
which eventually is caused by starting
by<00:01:54.390> turning<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.840> hips<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.649> knees<00:01:55.829> and

arms and shoulders around faster to get

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.609 
arms and shoulders around faster to get
back<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> impact<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.899> try<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> get<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> club

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
back on the aiming line but the problem

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.209 
back on the aiming line but the problem
is<00:02:03.509> once<00:02:03.689> all<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.110> turning<00:02:04.530> starts<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
is once all of this turning starts the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.770 
is once all of this turning starts the
club<00:02:05.430> goes<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.909> across<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.420> comes<00:02:06.570> back

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
club goes out and across and comes back

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410 
club goes out and across and comes back
down<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.500> inside<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> first<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
down to the inside so the first the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
down to the inside so the first the
first<00:02:09.690> big<00:02:09.869> issue<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:10.619> sure<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.800> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
first big issue is to make sure that you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.500 
first big issue is to make sure that you
don't<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.550> into<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.879> sacred<00:02:12.209> burial

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
don't go back into the sacred burial

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.210 
don't go back into the sacred burial
ground

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
ground

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.490 
ground
in<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.490> backswing<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.330> if<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.110> go<00:02:15.290> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
in the backswing because if you go you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.660 
in the backswing because if you go you
go<00:02:15.680> into<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.070> barrel<00:02:16.250> ground<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
go into the barrel ground on the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.070 
go into the barrel ground on the
backswing<00:02:17.060> you're<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> come<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.780> across

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
backswing you're going to come on across

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.630 
backswing you're going to come on across
and<00:02:18.320> go<00:02:18.410> into<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> fourth<00:02:19.160> swing<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and go into it in a fourth swing and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.920 
and go into it in a fourth swing and
that's<00:02:19.940> where<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.120> use<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.450> statement<00:02:20.690> egg

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's where I use the statement egg

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.870 
that's where I use the statement egg
that<00:02:21.350> golf<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:21.920> life<00:02:22.130> what<00:02:22.430> goes<00:02:22.670> around

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
that golf is like life what goes around

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.280 
that golf is like life what goes around
comes<00:02:23.330> around

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
comes around

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.690 
comes around
what<00:02:24.530> goes<00:02:24.710> straight<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.040> comes<00:02:25.490> straight

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
what goes straight up comes straight

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.490 
what goes straight up comes straight
down<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> think<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.840> first<00:02:26.990> point<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:27.380> have

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
down so I think the first point we have

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.870 
down so I think the first point we have
to<00:02:27.590> look<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.700> make<00:02:28.850> sure

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
to look at is that you have to make sure

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.340 
to look at is that you have to make sure
that<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.240> don't<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.780> sacred<00:02:30.110> burial

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
that you don't get in a sacred burial

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.630 
that you don't get in a sacred burial
ground<00:02:30.410> now<00:02:31.100> you're<00:02:31.280> probably<00:02:31.430> wondering

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
ground now you're probably wondering

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.550 
ground now you're probably wondering
what<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.420> plant<00:02:32.750> doing<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.170> front<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> me

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
I have it on this side of me because I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.690 
I have it on this side of me because I
want<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> address<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.640> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
want to address this for the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.250 
want to address this for the
follow-through<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> part<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.020> drill

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
follow-through as a part of the drill

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.540 
follow-through as a part of the drill
but<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.740> could<00:02:48.890> also<00:02:49.010> do<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
but you could also do it in the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.920 
but you could also do it in the
backswing<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.090> could<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> stick<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
backswing you could have a stick you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.420 
backswing you could have a stick you
could<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.440> same<00:02:51.710> stick<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.280> that

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
could have that same stick here so that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.340 
could have that same stick here so that
when<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.670> come<00:02:52.880> back<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:54.050> hit<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
when you come back in and you hit the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.680 
when you come back in and you hit the
stick<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.070> make<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.430> go<00:02:55.580> up<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.120> get<00:02:56.480> that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
stick and make you go up you get that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.920 
stick and make you go up you get that
that<00:02:57.230> sets<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:57.920> hear<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.190> click<00:02:58.930> you

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
that sets you you hear the click you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.020 
that sets you you hear the click you
hear<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.170> click<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.620> then<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.610> then<00:03:01.790> and

target you can't let it keep going here

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.680 
target you can't let it keep going here
because<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.400> eventually<00:05:29.700> get<00:05:30.270> pulled<00:05:30.540> in

here<00:05:30.870> and<00:05:31.020> then<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.950> point<00:05:32.160> is<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:32.580> the

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
here and then the point is is that the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.630 
here and then the point is is that the
more<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.210> turn<00:05:33.390> over<00:05:33.720> there<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:35.310> sooner<00:05:35.580> that

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
more you turn over there the sooner that

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.480 
more you turn over there the sooner that
starts<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.300> your<00:05:36.510> swing<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.470> if<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.220> starts

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
starts in your swing and if it starts

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.070 
starts in your swing and if it starts
before<00:05:38.790> impact<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.330> club<00:05:39.510> will<00:05:39.690> definitely

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
before impact the club will definitely

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.500 
before impact the club will definitely
be<00:05:40.230> be<00:05:40.650> early<00:05:40.950> released<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.490> getting<00:05:42.330> here

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
be be early released and getting here

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.910 
be be early released and getting here
when<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.720> clubface<00:05:43.050> has<00:05:43.230> already<00:05:43.500> squared<00:05:43.710> to

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
when the clubface has already squared to

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.950 
when the clubface has already squared to
the<00:05:44.010> left<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.370> pulling<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.390> inside<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:45.930> you

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
the left and pulling it inside and you

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.950 
the left and pulling it inside and you
can<00:05:46.500> hit<00:05:46.560> them<00:05:46.680> low<00:05:46.890> left<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.430> low<00:05:48.240> slices<00:05:48.810> as

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
can hit them low left of low slices as

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.250 
can hit them low left of low slices as
as<00:05:49.200> Tiger<00:05:50.070> fans<00:05:50.370> doing<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:51.300> we<00:05:51.840> have<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.110> learn

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
as Tiger fans doing so we have to learn

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.860 
as Tiger fans doing so we have to learn
this<00:05:52.440> awareness<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:53.040> space<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:54.630> best

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
this awareness in space and the best

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.780 
this awareness in space and the best
thing<00:05:55.050> I<00:05:55.140> think<00:05:55.170> is<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.950> get<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.250> feeling<00:05:56.520> of

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
thing I think is to get this feeling of

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.850 
thing I think is to get this feeling of
that<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.360> club<00:05:57.570> coming<00:05:57.870> ricochets<00:05:58.530> off<00:05:58.680> the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
that the club coming ricochets off the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.590
