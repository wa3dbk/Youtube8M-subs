down<00:01:06.740> till<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.770> find<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:08.970> passcode<00:01:09.540> now

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
down till we find time passcode now

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
down till we find time passcode now
should<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.800> enabled<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.370> default<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
should be enabled by default but turn it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
should be enabled by default but turn it
on<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.690> it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.990> allowed<00:01:13.710> through<00:01:13.950> passcode

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
on if it's not allowed through passcode

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.790 
on if it's not allowed through passcode
basically<00:01:15.210> lets<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.510> select<00:01:15.960> whether<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:16.590> not

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
basically lets you select whether or not

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.770 
basically lets you select whether or not
your<00:01:17.100> original<00:01:17.190> passcode<00:01:17.880> along<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.600> time

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
your original passcode along with time

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
your original passcode along with time
pass<00:01:18.960> code<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.260> unlock<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.800> phone<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.460> I'm

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
pass code to unlock the phone and I'm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.450 
pass code to unlock the phone and I'm
just<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:20.970> set<00:01:21.120> that<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:23.070> then

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
just going to set that on and then

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
just going to set that on and then
reverse<00:01:23.910> time<00:01:24.150> passcode<00:01:24.690> basically<00:01:25.080> lets<00:01:25.259> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
reverse time passcode basically lets you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960 
reverse time passcode basically lets you
select<00:01:25.500> whether<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.369> input<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
select whether you want to input the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.570 
select whether you want to input the
time<00:01:27.180> passcode<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.900> reverse<00:01:28.200> order<00:01:28.580> and

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
time passcode in reverse order and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.530 
time passcode in reverse order and
that's<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.180> terms<00:01:30.330> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that's about it in terms of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260 
that's about it in terms of
configurations<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.550> all<00:01:32.550> settings<00:01:33.150> are

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
configurations and all settings are

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.150 
configurations and all settings are
immediate<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:33.960> no<00:01:34.080> need<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.440> respring

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
immediate so there's no need to respring

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.520 
immediate so there's no need to respring
the<00:01:35.310> device<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> also<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.960> worthy<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> note
