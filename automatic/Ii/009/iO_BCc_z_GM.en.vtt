that okay um so yeah we've got stained

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.920 
that okay um so yeah we've got stained
glass<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> create<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
glass here and you want to create a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
glass here and you want to create a
really<00:01:31.229> nice<00:01:31.380> effect<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.090> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really nice effect what we can do is in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.630 
really nice effect what we can do is in
fact<00:01:33.570> using<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> light<00:01:34.740> blue<00:01:35.040> stained<00:01:35.340> glass

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
fact using the light blue stained glass

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.520 
fact using the light blue stained glass
we<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.030> fact<00:01:36.060> replace<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.320> ice

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
we can in fact replace all of the ice

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
we can in fact replace all of the ice
which<00:01:37.829> previously<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.579> used<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
which previously we used to use as a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.560 
which previously we used to use as a
form<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.049> stained<00:01:40.770> glass<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.850> use

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
form of stained glass as we can now use

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.520 
form of stained glass as we can now use
this<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> place<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.409> know

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this to place this like so and you know

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
this to place this like so and you know
it<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.770> gives<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> better<00:01:47.610> vibe<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it just gives it a better vibe because I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
it just gives it a better vibe because I
think<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.979> fact<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:51.119> say<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
think you can in fact I would say you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
think you can in fact I would say you
could<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:52.020> through<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.159> in

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
could see through a bit there but in

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
could see through a bit there but in
fact<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
fact it doesn't look like you can to the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
fact it doesn't look like you can to the
understand<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.829> guess<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> clearest<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.090> be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
understand I guess the clearest would be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
understand I guess the clearest would be
yeah<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> little

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
yeah I think you can see for a little

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
yeah I think you can see for a little
bit<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.850> does<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.649> cool<00:02:01.649> but

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
bit back and it does look a bit cool but

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.160 
bit back and it does look a bit cool but
I<00:02:02.009> guess<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> smooth<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.600> feature

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I guess if you want to smooth so feature

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.649 
I guess if you want to smooth so feature
my<00:02:04.380> guest<00:02:04.619> eyes<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> way<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.759> also<00:02:06.479> if

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
my guest eyes is the way to go also if

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.820 
my guest eyes is the way to go also if
you<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.380> regions<00:02:08.039> where

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
you are in regions where

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.499 
you are in regions where
you<00:02:09.070> know<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.250> want<00:02:09.610> light<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.030> stuff<00:02:10.330> I

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
you know you want light and stuff I

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.900 
you know you want light and stuff I
guess<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.710> is<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.950> best<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:12.550> light

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
guess this is the best because light

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.430 
guess this is the best because light
doesn't<00:02:13.240> know<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.260> make

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
doesn't know this so you have to make

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840 
doesn't know this so you have to make
sure<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.590> your<00:02:14.830> light<00:02:14.980> sources<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.730> know

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
sure that your light sources is you know

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.050 
sure that your light sources is you know
I'm<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:16.960> far<00:02:17.230> away<00:02:17.320> or<00:02:17.740> as<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.430> got<00:02:18.640> said<00:02:18.910> you

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'm really far away or as I got said you

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.510 
I'm really far away or as I got said you
can<00:02:19.360> mix<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.930> match<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.410> window<00:02:20.800> designs<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
can mix and match on window designs and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.130 
can mix and match on window designs and
you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.420> sort<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:22.960> that

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
you can just you know sort of do that

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.960 
you can just you know sort of do that
and<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.890> know<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.640> all<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and that and you know that going all the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.930 
and that and you know that going all the
way<00:02:25.000> across<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.600> look<00:02:25.750> pretty<00:02:25.990> cool<00:02:26.230> also

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
way across would look pretty cool also

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.370 
way across would look pretty cool also
not<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.180> with<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.420> design<00:02:28.930> what<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.200> can

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
not just with that design what you can

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.410 
not just with that design what you can
also<00:02:29.560> do<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.950> gather<00:02:30.190> ice<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.850> then<00:02:31.000> place<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
also do is gather ice and then place the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
also do is gather ice and then place the
ice<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.750> between<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.350> then<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.620> mix<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
ice in between and then just mix and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
ice in between and then just mix and
match<00:02:33.190> with<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.540> guys<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.840> see

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
match with that so as you guys can see

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.130 
match with that so as you guys can see
you<00:02:35.560> come<00:02:35.740> out<00:02:35.770> with<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.400> nice<00:02:36.730> design

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
you come out with a really nice design

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.540 
you come out with a really nice design
of<00:02:38.140> stained<00:02:38.440> glass<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:39.010> just<00:02:39.250> looks<00:02:39.460> really

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
of stained glass it just looks really

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.610 
of stained glass it just looks really
cool<00:02:40.210> something<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.020> makes<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.380> city

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
cool something that just makes your city

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.070 
cool something that just makes your city
that<00:02:41.920> extra<00:02:42.370> bit<00:02:42.520> better<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.540> ship<00:02:43.930> it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that extra bit better that ship it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.200 
that extra bit better that ship it
stands<00:02:44.350> up<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.800> do<00:02:45.040> need<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.490> do<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.120> on

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
stands up I do need to do this on and on

stands up I do need to do this on and on
my<00:02:46.330> see<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.930> guys<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.380> expose

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
my see so if you guys do have expose

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.560 
my see so if you guys do have expose
what<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.890> know<00:02:47.980> most<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.459> guys<00:02:48.640> do<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:48.910> 360

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
what I know most of you guys do have 360

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.360 
what I know most of you guys do have 360
but<00:02:50.020> hopefully<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:50.590> will<00:02:50.709> be<00:02:50.890> coming<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.250> a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
but hopefully there will be coming to a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.920 
but hopefully there will be coming to a
black<00:02:51.550> cross-platform<00:02:52.090> play<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.690> need<00:02:52.840> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
black cross-platform play that I need to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.910 
black cross-platform play that I need to
talk<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.290> guys<00:02:53.380> about

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
talk to you guys about

talk to you guys about
so<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.670> possibly<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.330> get<00:02:55.570> some<00:02:55.720> new<00:02:55.870> 360

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
so that possibly I can get some new 360
