phone<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.140> basically<00:00:21.140> let's<00:00:21.950> start<00:00:22.130> off<00:00:22.220> with

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
phone so basically let's start off with

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.740 
phone so basically let's start off with
why<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:22.640> want<00:00:23.120> to<00:00:23.210> do<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.330> hard<00:00:23.630> reset<00:00:25.600> one<00:00:26.600> of

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
why you want to do a hard reset one of

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.180 
why you want to do a hard reset one of
the<00:00:26.840> reasons<00:00:27.200> why<00:00:27.320> we<00:00:27.500> want<00:00:27.650> to<00:00:27.740> do<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:27.980> hard

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
the reasons why we want to do the hard

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.040 
the reasons why we want to do the hard
reset<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:28.640> if<00:00:29.030> you<00:00:29.270> screw<00:00:29.480> up<00:00:29.510> something<00:00:29.990> on

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
reset is if you screw up something on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.950 
reset is if you screw up something on
the<00:00:30.110> phone<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.590> need<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.920> revert<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.280> back<00:00:31.960> so

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
the phone you need to revert it back so

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.590 
the phone you need to revert it back so
that<00:00:33.649> leads<00:00:33.890> us<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.100> what<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.149> hard<00:00:35.300> reset

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
that leads us to what the hard reset

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.619 
that leads us to what the hard reset
does<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.940> what<00:00:37.940> precautions<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.420> have<00:00:38.539> to

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
does and what precautions you have to

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.869 
does and what precautions you have to
take<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.050> that's<00:00:39.859> just<00:00:39.980> if<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:40.370> already<00:00:40.550> know

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
take so that's just if you already know

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.209 
take so that's just if you already know
then<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.570> can<00:00:41.719> just<00:00:41.839> fast-forward<00:00:42.769> this

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
then you can just fast-forward this

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.630 
then you can just fast-forward this
video<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:44.679> Harvey<00:00:45.679> setting<00:00:45.920> basically<00:00:46.460> is

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
video and Harvey setting basically is

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.369 
video and Harvey setting basically is
wiping<00:00:47.149> out<00:00:47.269> all<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.659> data<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.079> your<00:00:48.109> phone

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
wiping out all the data in your phone

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.669 
wiping out all the data in your phone
and<00:00:48.649> resetting<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.659> back<00:00:50.659> to<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.319> factory

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
and resetting it back to the factory

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.889 
and resetting it back to the factory
settings<00:00:51.999> if<00:00:52.999> you<00:00:53.059> have<00:00:53.210> a<00:00:53.269> memory<00:00:53.510> card<00:00:53.629> in

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
settings if you have a memory card in

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.569 
settings if you have a memory card in
there<00:00:54.019> it<00:00:54.170> will<00:00:54.319> probably<00:00:54.530> not<00:00:54.859> wipe<00:00:55.249> it<00:00:55.429> out

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
there it will probably not wipe it out

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.559 
there it will probably not wipe it out
but<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:55.879> still<00:00:56.179> suggest<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.999> take<00:00:58.999> it<00:00:59.059> out<00:00:59.269> just

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
but I still suggest you take it out just

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.759 
but I still suggest you take it out just
in<00:00:59.659> case<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.739> let's<00:01:01.460> start<00:01:01.699> with<00:01:01.819> or<00:01:02.409> let's<00:01:03.409> do

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
in case so let's start with or let's do

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.219
