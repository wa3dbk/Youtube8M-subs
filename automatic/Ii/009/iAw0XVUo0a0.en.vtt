00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
 at 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 and there's everybody welcome on this 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.410
 new video 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 I hope you're fine I 'm going 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 talk to you today so the good 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.810
 guillou weekly update so for those who 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 do not know what the good geek is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.309
 lie update is simply the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.750
 information coming out on styles 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 and so what decides developers 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 what will be put up on the game to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.340
 through the next patches so everything 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.379
 first I will speak the week 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.239
 last of the last bungie weekly 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.140
 update so that was talking about the kof which is 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 bigger etc 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.390
 you should know that this patch 1.1 point 2 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.830
 is now complete and will be released 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 so soon for really 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.339
 know the release date of this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 next patch it will be enough to follow so 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.350
 the twitter account of bangui this is what 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 about the bungee weekly update of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 this week so the developers 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.180
 still really thought about 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.799
 pvp ammunition 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.870
 they realized that really 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.970
 the game was very focused on weapons 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.850
 secondary and heavy weapons they have 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.409
 so decided to basically reduce 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 special ammunition and the other will be 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 much rarer here ie 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.080
 that they try to consolidate the role of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.790
 this one by making them more rare and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 that's a lot more strategic know to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.840
 what time to use them so they go 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.940
 appear less often there will be more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 of time needed to pick them up 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.120
 so there will be fewer cases of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.130
 ammo on the map 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.320
 they will therefore logically give less 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.270
 of ammunition by cons the increase 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 the scope of the recovery of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 ammo will be increased ie 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.910
 you will not necessarily need 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 to be stuck to the box to recover 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.870
 ammunition and there will also be the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 removing the glitch to have some 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.620
 ammunition the other so that forces you 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.260
 can see right here in the bottom of the screen 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.180
 here is there will be also several small 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.220
 novelties so as regards so his 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.230
 ammunition the order always that the delay 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850
 between the announced and the arrival of 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.350
 heavy ammo 30 increased by 5 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.270
 seconds from the time that we 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.170
 already knows and there will also be a 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.569
 kind of mines 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.550
 three in the form of visual messages 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 as well as a little animation at the level 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.470
 of the chest of which you like the gifs here 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.230
 even on the screen the developers have 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.849
 also wanted to rework on the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 damage of some weapons so that's 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.540
 really a perpetual debate there is 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 always small modifications but 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.170
 apparently they still do not like them 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.520
 so they will work on some 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 weapons by cons they tell us not 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.510
 which is the part 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.069
 for the pvp and now she's going to have 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.319
 a small part for the tower with 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.730
 a few changes including two 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.830
 changes and they really are not so 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.510
 badly that so first of all there will be Meme it 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.280
 putting in place a better use of 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.290
 weapons that will prevent dismantle those 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.450
 so this will be simply by the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 pressure of a joystick and if you ever 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.569
 want to demonstrate your army it will take 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.580
 first unlock it here so 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.600
 it avoids dismantling unfortunately 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.510
 a weapon that we do not want 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.160
 dismantled and the second big 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.420
 information here we are it's always 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.100
 nice is not something that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.350
 will change the game but it's still 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.970
 friendly we can now wear 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.769
 the helmet at the tower so we will have the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.930
 choice to wear this case or not you 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.209
 see here on the screen how will be 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.700
 this choice via the menu certainly 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.019
 lescar inventory that this video that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.579
 you're calling was not saying what 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.980
 do you think if you agree or 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.720
 not with the choices of bungie months in this 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.040
 which concerns the pvp I find that it is 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.120
 really smart the choices they 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.859
 do because it's true that we have done 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.650
 often killed with shotgun or sniper 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.060
 and I think it's really going really 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.250
 limited the players to play like that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.500
 it is rather not bad with regard to 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.570
 then locking the weapons for 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.890
 my case i have sam reach boss because 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.140
 that it's kind of paying attention to what I 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.040
 phone demens and for wearing the headphones I 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.870
 find that it is really very 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.519
 nice especially when we will add 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.959
 a new headset for example in the 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.970
 next dlc you will have the chance to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.069
 to taste a new helmet and you 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.019
 chance to show the tower frankly 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.160
 I think it's done here go 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.359
 I leave you people were not there 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.590
 leave your comments I you 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.280
 wish everyone a very good day 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.579
 and see you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.579
 schultz
