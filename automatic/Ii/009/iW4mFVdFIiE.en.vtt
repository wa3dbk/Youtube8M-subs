00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.410
 talk about why lionel messi is better 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.450
 that ronaldinho and that ronaldo christian 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.849
 it's simple messi has achieved more things from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.309
 both together at just 24 years old 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 among them are three champions two 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.350
 world clubs three gold balls 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 consecutively a three-time league or 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.660
 is to win three consecutive leagues besides 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 that is a more complete player since 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.039
 he also plays as a team putting 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 unimaginable assists getting great 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 number of goals and a quality 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 impressive and with a mentality of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 enviable game while ronaldinho 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 and Christian are also some players 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 very thin but usually they are very 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.820
 individualists and they play for them 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 while messi plays for the team 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 Now think about if Messi overcomes 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.700
 those two great players has won 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 everything has broken all the records 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.260
 including the top scorer in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 history of the club at just 24 years 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.430
 that he will not have done when he is old 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 by ronaldinho de cr7 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 and do not come to me with that you have to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.580
 win a world cup or that does not pay with the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.380
 Argentina team since they believe that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 Messi will do everything and if he loses 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 the team is because of messi 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 gentlemen let me tell you that this is a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.940
 team game and month and for the better 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
 that it can not do everything himself 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.900
 because they believe that in the barça if you play 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 excellent because in the barça if they play 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.280
 as a team but in spite of everything to me 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.619
 it seems that if it yields with the selection 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.320
 argentina think about who leads 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.479
 the team with just 24 years old who 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.729
 put all the passes hywind and the kun 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.440
 Agero is more in the last game he got 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.170
 three goals so do not come with me 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.180
 things that cr7 has also won nothing with 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.130
 portugal what I do recognize is that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 ronaldinho has weighed with his selection 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.590
 and has won several trophies like the cup 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.360
 america the confederations and a world 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.160
 good friends that has been all remember 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 that this is my opinion and I do not intend 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.880
 offend anyone 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 subscribe to the channel and think well 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.690
 they really want a content full of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.759
 pure garbage and full of rudeness without 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.009
 sense or if you prefer some comments 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.960
 well thought out and objectives because I do not 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.770
 I'm one of those retards who say pure 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.810
 rudeness 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.829
 and they post stupid cures so 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.829
 take care and goodbye
