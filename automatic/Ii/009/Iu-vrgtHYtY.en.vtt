00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
the end of this round here the game had

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.040 
the end of this round here the game had
been<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.880> progress<00:04:26.090> already<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:29.419> I'm<00:04:29.570> happy

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
been in progress already but I'm happy

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.779 
been in progress already but I'm happy
with<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.320> break-even<00:04:30.740> they're<00:04:31.099> happy<00:04:31.639> with<00:04:31.669> a

with a break-even they're happy with a
break<00:04:31.970> even<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.830> think<00:04:33.830> if<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.099> look<00:04:34.310> at<00:04:34.400> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
break even I think if you look at the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.570 
break even I think if you look at the
school<00:04:34.820> board<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:36.020> school<00:04:36.349> board<00:04:36.650> pretty
