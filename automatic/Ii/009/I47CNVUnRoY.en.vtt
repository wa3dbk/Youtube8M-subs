hello guys and welcome to star mate
today<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.730> messing<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.270> rails<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.170> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
today I was messing with rails and I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.250 
today I was messing with rails and I
managed<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.640> build<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.029> fully<00:00:21.449> functional

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
managed to build a fully functional

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
managed to build a fully functional
elevator<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:23.670> minimal<00:00:24.359> logic<00:00:24.840> yes<00:00:26.150> are<00:00:27.150> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
elevator with minimal logic yes are you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
elevator with minimal logic yes are you
tired<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.470> those<00:00:28.740> elevators<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.460> use

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
tired of all those elevators that use

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.410 
tired of all those elevators that use
100<00:00:30.900> plus<00:00:31.230> logic<00:00:31.859> blocks<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.790> kinds

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
100 plus logic blocks of all kinds

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
100 plus logic blocks of all kinds
delays<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:35.040> gates<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.880> such<00:00:36.829> well<00:00:37.829> wait

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
delays and or gates and such well wait

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.350 
delays and or gates and such well wait
no<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.410> elevator<00:00:40.980> only<00:00:41.370> uses

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
no more because this elevator only uses

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
no more because this elevator only uses
28<00:00:43.160> activation<00:00:44.160> blocks<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.789> activation<00:00:45.660> box

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
28 activation blocks and activation box

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.090 
28 activation blocks and activation box
only<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> most<00:00:48.600> simple<00:00:49.170> efficient

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
only it's the most simple efficient

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.290 
only it's the most simple efficient
working<00:00:50.610> elevator<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:54.030> call

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
working elevator so you can call

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
working elevator so you can call
elevator<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:55.079> each<00:00:55.350> floor<00:00:55.739> floor<00:00:56.219> no<00:00:56.760> matter

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
elevator from each floor floor no matter

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
elevator from each floor floor no matter
where<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.949> inside

take you to h4 I also managed to
decorate<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> elevator<00:01:06.060> pit<00:01:06.390> /<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
decorate the elevator pit / put in a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.690 
decorate the elevator pit / put in a
nice<00:01:07.860> cabin<00:01:08.310> nice<00:01:09.119> elevator<00:01:09.750> shaft<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
nice cabin nice elevator shaft and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.490 
nice cabin nice elevator shaft and
actual<00:01:11.700> signs<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> activation<00:01:13.260> blocks

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
actual signs over the activation blocks

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.969 
actual signs over the activation blocks
so<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.760> press<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> yeah<00:01:16.680> once

the<00:01:17.189> official<00:01:17.790> rails<00:01:18.119> update<00:01:18.750> come<00:01:19.080> comes<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the official rails update come comes I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460 
the official rails update come comes I
will<00:01:20.369> release<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> official<00:01:22.020> version<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
will release the official version of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
will release the official version of
this<00:01:22.619> elevator<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:26.909> there

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this elevator and I know I know there

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.710 
this elevator and I know I know there
are<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.720> elevators<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.920> already

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
are all of elevators out there already

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.350 
are all of elevators out there already
but<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.619> using<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.369> minimal<00:01:32.970> logic

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but this one is using the minimal logic

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.010 
but this one is using the minimal logic
the<00:01:33.689> absolute<00:01:34.380> minimum<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:36.270> can't<00:01:36.689> get

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the absolute minimum and it can't get

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
the absolute minimum and it can't get
smaller<00:01:37.409> than<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.579> ultimate<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
smaller than this it's the ultimate one

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.830 
smaller than this it's the ultimate one
so<00:01:40.439> stop<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> logic<00:01:41.520> abuse<00:01:41.880> guys<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so stop the logic abuse guys make it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.580 
so stop the logic abuse guys make it
simple<00:01:43.850> hope<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> enjoyed<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> video<00:01:45.689> thank
