00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
chain so to get started you're using

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
chain so to get started you're using
just<00:00:59.040> two<00:00:59.250> different<00:00:59.370> colors<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> the

pictures that you see of the finished
blanket<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.420> used<00:01:03.660> three<00:01:04.140> could<00:01:04.800> actually<00:01:04.979> make

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
blanket I used three could actually make

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
blanket I used three could actually make
each<00:01:05.580> stripe<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.150> different<00:01:06.510> color<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
each stripe a different color if you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.040 
each stripe a different color if you
wanted<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:07.800> something<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.250> vivid

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050

I'm just using the two the two different
colors<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> tutorial<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:16.020> pattern<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
colors in this tutorial the pattern is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
colors in this tutorial the pattern is
I'll<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.460> ahead<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.910> explain<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I'll go ahead and explain that to you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
I'll go ahead and explain that to you
you<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.740> eight<00:01:19.979> rows<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.570> main<00:01:21.810> color<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you do eight rows of the main color the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.749 
you do eight rows of the main color the
contrasting<00:01:24.119> color<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.899> do<00:01:25.050> two<00:01:25.380> rows

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
contrasting color you would do two rows

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.050 
contrasting color you would do two rows
back<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> main<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.899> would<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.140> two<00:01:28.440> rows

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
back to the main you would do two rows

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.380 
back to the main you would do two rows
back<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.330> contrasting<00:01:31.229> two<00:01:31.560> rows<00:01:32.180> back<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
back to the contrasting two rows back to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.430 
back to the contrasting two rows back to
the<00:01:33.479> main<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:34.560> rows<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.090> eight<00:01:36.360> rows<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
the main two rows and then eight rows of

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.889 
the main two rows and then eight rows of
the<00:01:37.619> contrasting<00:01:38.399> color<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:39.720> just

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
the contrasting color and you just

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.300 
the contrasting color and you just
continue<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> work<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.770> way<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
continue to work that way so that you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.180 
continue to work that way so that you
have<00:01:41.490> alternating<00:01:42.360> thick<00:01:43.259> stripes<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.039> your

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
have alternating thick stripes of your

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.800 
have alternating thick stripes of your
colors<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.530> alternating<00:01:46.530> skinny<00:01:47.100> bands<00:01:47.810> or

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
colors and alternating skinny bands or

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
colors and alternating skinny bands or
skinny<00:01:49.200> stripes<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.810> begin<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:53.009> always

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
skinny stripes so to begin we always

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
skinny stripes so to begin we always
start<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.940> our<00:01:54.090> Slipknot<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.869> we're<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
start with our Slipknot so we're just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.109 
start with our Slipknot so we're just
taking<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.530> tail<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.100> folding<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.580> over

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.870 

we're<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.209> to<00:02:00.270> flop<00:02:00.599> that<00:02:00.810> loop<00:02:01.080> over<00:02:01.880> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we're going to flop that loop over and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.779 
we're going to flop that loop over and
using<00:02:03.360> our<00:02:03.450> hook<00:02:03.720> pulling<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.319> up<00:02:04.789> holding

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
using our hook pulling it up holding

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.630 
using our hook pulling it up holding
these<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:05.940> tails<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> pulling<00:02:07.140> down<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> for

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
these two tails and pulling down so for

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.130 
these two tails and pulling down so for
the<00:02:08.729> completed<00:02:09.300> blanket<00:02:09.750> you're<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the completed blanket you're going to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.790 
the completed blanket you're going to
chain<00:02:10.849> 129<00:02:11.849> I'm<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.500> small

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
chain 129 I'm going to do just a small

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
chain 129 I'm going to do just a small
sample

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.920 

to<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.800> started<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.370> that's<00:02:18.489> one<00:02:19.200> two<00:02:20.700> three

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
to get started so that's one two three

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.030 
to get started so that's one two three
four<00:02:23.220> five<00:02:24.630> six<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.690> first<00:02:28.930> row<00:02:29.230> and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
four five six so for the first row and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.860 
four five six so for the first row and
as<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.700> mentioned<00:02:31.000> before<00:02:31.090> I'm<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.569> doing<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
as I mentioned before I'm just doing a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.470 
as I mentioned before I'm just doing a
small<00:02:32.080> sample<00:02:32.800> for<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:34.000> would<00:02:34.120> have<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
small sample for you you would have a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.180 
small sample for you you would have a
very<00:02:34.830> long<00:02:35.830> chain<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.510> 129<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> very<00:02:38.920> first

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
very long chain of 129 so the very first

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.130 
very long chain of 129 so the very first
stitch<00:02:39.489> we're<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.540> we're<00:02:41.110> going

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
so we're going to be going into this one

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.890 
so we're going to be going into this one
right<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:50.980> going<00:02:51.370> into<00:02:51.640> that

right here so just going into that
pulling<00:02:52.900> up<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.260> loop<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.860> you've<00:02:54.010> got<00:02:54.190> two

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
pulling up a loop so that you've got two

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.340 
pulling up a loop so that you've got two
on<00:02:54.610> your<00:02:54.730> hook<00:02:54.910> wrapping<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.989> pulling

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
on your hook wrapping and pulling

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.440 
on your hook wrapping and pulling
through<00:02:56.560> both<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:58.120> you're<00:02:58.269> going<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
through both and then you're going to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.710 
through both and then you're going to
chain<00:02:58.780> one<00:02:59.880> you're<00:03:00.880> going<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.090> skip<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.690> next

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
chain one you're going to skip the next

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.589 
chain one you're going to skip the next
stitch<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.739> you're<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:03.970> into<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.299> very

next one with another single crochet and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.089 
next one with another single crochet and
chain<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.080> entire<00:03:11.560> pattern

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
chain one so this is the entire pattern

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.690 
chain one so this is the entire pattern
for<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.380> entire<00:03:14.380> blanket<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.250> always<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
for the entire blanket it's always the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000 
for the entire blanket it's always the
same<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.120> keeps<00:03:16.540> repeating<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.349> it<00:03:17.860> gets

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
same it just keeps repeating and it gets

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.830 
same it just keeps repeating and it gets
easier<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.580> see<00:03:18.819> where<00:03:19.000> your<00:03:19.150> stitches<00:03:19.540> go

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
easier to see where your stitches go

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.620 
easier to see where your stitches go
once<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.290> get<00:03:20.410> past<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.980> chained<00:03:21.400> row<00:03:21.760> so

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
once you get past this chained row so

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.949 
once you get past this chained row so
we're<00:03:22.810> skipping<00:03:23.079> one<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.480> single<00:03:25.480> crocheting

to<00:04:09.190> go<00:04:09.310> into<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.640> very<00:04:09.700> first<00:04:10.420> stitch<00:04:10.830> with<00:04:11.830> a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
to go into this very first stitch with a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.360 
to go into this very first stitch with a
single<00:04:12.310> crochet<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:15.670> tail<00:04:15.940> out<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.239> way

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
single crochet that tail out of the way

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.479 
single crochet that tail out of the way
chain<00:04:18.370> one<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.260> skip<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.859> second

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
chain one and then you skip that second

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.850 
chain one and then you skip that second
one<00:04:21.580> there<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:22.600> now<00:04:22.780> as<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.140> can<00:04:23.410> see<00:04:23.710> it's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
one there so now as you can see it's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.830 
one there so now as you can see it's
much<00:04:24.010> easier<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.430> see<00:04:24.790> that<00:04:25.030> we're<00:04:25.210> going<00:04:25.450> in

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
much easier to see that we're going in

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.670 
much easier to see that we're going in
between<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:28.210> stitches<00:04:28.480> or<00:04:28.930> single<00:04:29.260> crochets

between the stitches or single crochets

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.220 
between the stitches or single crochets
they're<00:04:30.190> easier<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.850> see<00:04:31.150> at<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.480> point<00:04:31.840> so

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
they're easier to see at this point so

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.950 
they're easier to see at this point so
you<00:04:32.260> just<00:04:32.530> single<00:04:32.890> crochet<00:04:32.919> chain<00:04:33.930> one<00:04:36.960> single
