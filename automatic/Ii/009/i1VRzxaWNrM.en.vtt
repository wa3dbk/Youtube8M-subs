00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.599
 so far the mini padphone one of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.670
 recent releases of asus and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 in the second semester it's getting to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 Brazil 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 it is a hybrid follows the logical line 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 padphone but it has some minor measures 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 so here we have a time a tablet 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.590
 7-inch and also a smartphone 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 4 inches so the product is ideal for 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 who is wanting these two things that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 solve with a single product 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.059
 the 4-inch smartphone is finished 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.629
 down here has been a brand 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 of this generation of asus and he 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 Comes with 4.3 Android system but must 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
 receive upgrade to 14.4 I will show a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.530
 bit of the interface it has some 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.239
 changes to asus will bring what 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 calls for performance 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.899
 you can see that some things are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 a little different we are 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.590
 accustomed in traditional android 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.180
 I was posting here in the interface as well 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.750
 you can see that the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 very simple icons and symbols and such 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 it is still in development then 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.979
 no use show much here for you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.010
 because there is a lot that has not yet 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.500
 is then working specifications 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.509
 include here atom processor 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 happening with all the smartphones that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.200
 the assumption of this generation are 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.689
 betting on the atom line 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 We have a back camera here in the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.860
 8-megapixel camera and a front of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 2 megapixels 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 the other specifications therein will include 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 also 118 grams in the cell phone and doc weighs 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.869
 260 grams or a set that is not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 heavy even the two together 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.329
 it has no price defined in the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.750
 Brazil and even the 7-inch tablet 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.270
 hd resolution and the cell phone is already a bit 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.420
 the smaller it has a screen of 480 by 800 a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 tft's ambition is not model 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 first is the premium screen finishing 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.939
 but still not quality 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.770
 Okay, you see, it does not have much. 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.469
 destruction of the image even leaving 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
 so a product that arrives in the second 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.170
 semester in Brazil it does not have a price 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.879
 defined and that is a strong choice for 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.530
 who is wanting to solve both tablet 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.060
 with smartphone and want very 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.760
 and even indirectly from the showroom 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 of the asus in the suppers 2014 and follow of eye 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
 on adrenaline for more news here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.290
 from las vegas fair 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.290
