00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello today I'm going to show you a variant 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.280
 for for this stitch you already know that 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.010
 We can work in two ways 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.709
 different is to say nothing more with a 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.779
 line or with both now yes we work 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.810
 I'll show you the two lines 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.980
 put in a little bank our thread and 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.289
 let's tell this we know there are six 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.349
 then we count one two three and you 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.630
 we open here and there are three of this side 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.240
 three up and three down and what 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.900
 we do is that around here 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:43.329
 we locate the center we open it and we go to 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:49.860
 take out our thread on this shore 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 now we are that they are 1 2 1 2 3 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.450
 and they are three up and three down well 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.880
 here we are going to start making a 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.710
 little flower which we are going to work on 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.860
 next way these little flowers 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.520
 we are always going to work from above 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.880
 down is to say always we're going to 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.820
 enter by the same place but from above 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.960
 down for the center to go 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.890
 doing 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.350
 this a big eye and this is all 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.740
 to the network around we're going to be doing 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.100
 this 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.100
 let's go grabbing a thread 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.439
 let's go through it a thread 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.439
 all around 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 until we have it here we locate the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 center of the other that would come doing 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.650
 You already know that we take them out in a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.350
 little corner 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.620
 and then we locate the center that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.720
 would be 123 and we open here and 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.090
 then we start from here already 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.920
 be as they settle here or towards 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.670
 here but we are going through a female 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.500
 we're going through that thread 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.630
 traveling and we are working in a way 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.650
 surround and so they will stay 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.599
 its strut 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.079
 with love for you nelly solÃ­s 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.079
