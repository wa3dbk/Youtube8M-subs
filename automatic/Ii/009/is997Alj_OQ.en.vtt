00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
so whole thing condenses down into the

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.540 
so whole thing condenses down into the
stock<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.170> it<00:00:45.229> fits<00:00:45.440> right<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.220> side<00:00:46.400> of<00:00:46.430> a
