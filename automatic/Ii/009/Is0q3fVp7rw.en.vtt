00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080 

a<00:00:00.089> little<00:00:00.420> milk<00:00:00.630> bills<00:00:00.810> that<00:00:00.989> one<00:00:01.140> more<00:00:02.090> does

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
a little milk bills that one more does

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.380 
a little milk bills that one more does
not<00:00:03.330> make<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.750> twice<00:00:03.990> yeah<00:00:05.210> that's<00:00:06.210> like

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
not make that twice yeah that's like

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.990 
not make that twice yeah that's like
think<00:00:06.839> because<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.259> seems<00:00:07.470> like<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.770> one

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
think because it seems like that one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.780 
think because it seems like that one
because<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> basically<00:00:09.420> goes<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:10.790> one

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
because it basically goes from that one

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910 
because it basically goes from that one
dynamic<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.540> then<00:00:12.750> jumps<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.380> only<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
dynamic and then jumps up only for a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330 
dynamic and then jumps up only for a
little<00:00:14.070> yeah<00:00:15.199> set<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.379> that's<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.800> stuff

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
little yeah set it that's the stuff

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.370 
little yeah set it that's the stuff
so<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.699> played<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> full<00:00:18.539> through<00:00:18.900> once<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
so we played it full through once and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
so we played it full through once and
then<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> half<00:00:21.420> cat

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
then it's one time like like a half cat

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.340 
then it's one time like like a half cat
so<00:00:22.220> let's<00:00:23.220> change<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.789> yeah<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:24.840> good<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> would

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so let's change it yeah how good I would

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.810 
so let's change it yeah how good I would
play<00:00:25.529> along<00:00:25.650> still<00:00:26.039> though<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.699> can

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
play along still though just so we can

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.040 
play along still though just so we can
kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> show<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.269> where<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:27.810> want<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
kind of show you where we would want it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:01:01.010 
kind of show you where we would want it
in<00:00:38.629> yeah<00:00:39.629> yeah<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> ending<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.489> outro<00:01:00.020> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
in yeah yeah the ending the outro you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.330 
in yeah yeah the ending the outro you
can<00:01:01.140> probably<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.530> turn<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> met<00:01:02.100> off

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
can probably just turn the met off

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
can probably just turn the met off
because<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.780> least<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.229> kill

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
because or at least if you can kill

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.780 
because or at least if you can kill
anything<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
anything here because that's when I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.770 
anything here because that's when I
reach<00:01:06.000> ARDS<00:01:06.470> sample<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> bro
