 Hello! today I will show you how to create this chick. 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.380
 To create this chick I used a ready-made kit with precut shapes, which 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.930
 I purchased from Funlab.it In this kit there is everything you need to 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:35.050
 create 7 chicks, to be used not only to decorate, but also for example the Easter table, 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.149
 as placeholders. Chicks are simple to create and as a material 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:59.789
 to add there is only the glue and a pen. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.710
 As a first step, let's take the shape of the chick and go and draw the eyes with the pen. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 Then we glue the various parts: beak, legs, wings in the back and finally the feathers. 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:36.000
 When it is dry, use it to decorate gifts, frames or as a placeholder for the table.
