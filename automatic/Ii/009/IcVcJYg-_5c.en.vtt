00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.010 
your time and for a stronger pattern go
over<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.340> stencil<00:01:17.610> several<00:01:18.390> times<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
over the stencil several times so you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
over the stencil several times so you
put<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> nice<00:01:19.829> layer<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> color<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.329> change
