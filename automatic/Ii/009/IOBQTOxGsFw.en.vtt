around<00:00:37.680> each<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> feel<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
around each other is this feel like the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
around each other is this feel like the
biggest<00:00:39.510> game<00:00:39.899> you've<00:00:40.200> played<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
biggest game you've played for the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.350 
biggest game you've played for the
England<00:00:41.399> under-21s<00:00:42.469> um<00:00:43.760> yeah<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.030> mean<00:00:45.180> I'd

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
England under-21s um yeah I mean I'd

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560 
England under-21s um yeah I mean I'd
definitely<00:00:45.809> say<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> game

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
definitely say so because it's a game

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
definitely say so because it's a game
that<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> go<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that you know we're going to go into and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
that you know we're going to go into and
it<00:00:50.460> could<00:00:50.670> potentially<00:00:50.820> take<00:00:51.360> us<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it could potentially take us into the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.340 
it could potentially take us into the
last<00:00:52.860> four<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> tournament<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
last four of the tournament and I'm and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
last four of the tournament and I'm and
I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.870> for<00:00:57.870> us<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I think for us you know it's more it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.189 
I think for us you know it's more it's
more<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.859> going<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> game<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.199> not

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
more about going into the game and not

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.479 
more about going into the game and not
trying<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> put<00:01:04.680> too<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.040> pressure<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
trying to put too much pressure on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
trying to put too much pressure on
ourselves<00:01:05.840> but<00:01:06.840> making<00:01:07.409> sure<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.770> we

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
ourselves but making sure that we

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.469 
ourselves but making sure that we
perform<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> try<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> result<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
perform and try and get the result that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
perform and try and get the result that
we<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> feel<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.799> side<00:01:11.040> still<00:01:11.369> got

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
we need do you feel this side still got

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.170 
we need do you feel this side still got
a<00:01:11.700> few<00:01:12.420> gears<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.960> move<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.189> nice<00:01:14.970> talk

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a few gears to move up into a nice talk

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.130 
a few gears to move up into a nice talk
about<00:01:15.360> definitely<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> think

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
about definitely you know I think

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
about definitely you know I think
there's<00:01:19.140> there's<00:01:19.830> always<00:01:20.180> whatever<00:01:21.180> you've

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there's there's always whatever you've

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.550 
there's there's always whatever you've
played<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.840> there's<00:01:21.990> always<00:01:22.080> room<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
played like there's always room for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520 
played like there's always room for
improvement<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:24.110> suppose<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.290> depends

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
improvement but I suppose it depends

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
improvement but I suppose it depends
what<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> feel<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.700> football<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
what what you feel is good football you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
what what you feel is good football you
know<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> first<00:01:27.689> game<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.080> create<00:01:28.439> more

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
know in the first game we create more

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.670 
know in the first game we create more
chances<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.250> Portugal<00:01:30.140> but<00:01:31.140> people<00:01:31.290> said<00:01:31.560> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
chances in Portugal but people said we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.469 
chances in Portugal but people said we
didn't<00:01:31.860> control<00:01:32.189> again<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.060> second<00:01:33.360> game

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
didn't control again in the second game

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.030 
didn't control again in the second game
we<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.720> sixty-five<00:01:34.229> percent<00:01:34.380> possession

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we have sixty-five percent possession

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
we have sixty-five percent possession
but<00:01:35.790> people<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.270> didn't<00:01:36.420> move<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> ball

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
but people say we didn't move the ball

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.219 
but people say we didn't move the ball
quickly<00:01:37.020> enough<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.890> suppose<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.460> we

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
quickly enough so I suppose if we

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.060 
quickly enough so I suppose if we
dominate<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> game<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> create<00:01:40.950> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
dominate the game and create more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
dominate the game and create more
chances<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> score<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.030> goals<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.509> what

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
chances and score more goals that's what

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.600 
chances and score more goals that's what
we're<00:01:42.780> looking<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.250> we're<00:01:44.250> always<00:01:44.369> looking

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
we're looking for we're always looking

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
we're looking for we're always looking
for<00:01:44.909> perfection<00:01:45.030> we're<00:01:45.540> always<00:01:45.630> looking<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
for perfection we're always looking to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.609 
for perfection we're always looking to
