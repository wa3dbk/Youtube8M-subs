00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
options dialog let's just take the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.990 
options dialog let's just take the
defaults<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:27.960> fine<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.609> here's<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.820> new

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
defaults that's fine and here's our new

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.250 
defaults that's fine and here's our new
sequence<00:00:30.800> now<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.430> put<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:33.090> effects<00:00:34.079> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
sequence now we can put some effects in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
sequence now we can put some effects in
here<00:00:34.649> maybe<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.280> channel<00:00:35.700> will<00:00:35.940> fade<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.480> at

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
here maybe this channel will fade up at

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
here maybe this channel will fade up at
the<00:00:36.960> beginning<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> song<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.940> all

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the beginning of the song and then all

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
the beginning of the song and then all
of<00:00:39.239> them<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:40.489> pop<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> short<00:00:43.079> time<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
of them will pop on for a short time and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.610 
of them will pop on for a short time and
then<00:00:43.879> they'll<00:00:44.879> fade<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> little

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
then they'll fade down for a little

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
then they'll fade down for a little
while<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> there's<00:00:48.989> our<00:00:49.140> sequence<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.780> let's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
while so there's our sequence and let's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.529 
while so there's our sequence and let's
go<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> Select<00:00:52.620> tool<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.539> you'll

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
go back to the Select tool and you'll

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
go back to the Select tool and you'll
see<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> time<00:00:55.079> scale<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:57.680> up<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.070> here

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
see the time scale here is up to here

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
see the time scale here is up to here
it's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> second<00:01:00.210> into<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.539> song<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.530> two

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it's a second into the song and then two

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
it's a second into the song and then two
seconds<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> three<00:01:03.149> seconds<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> song

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seconds and three seconds into the song

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.670 
seconds and three seconds into the song
and<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.850> play<00:01:06.150> you'll<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and if we play you'll see that when it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
and if we play you'll see that when it
reaches<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> second<00:01:09.210> has<00:01:09.390> passed

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
reaches here about a second has passed

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.490 
reaches here about a second has passed
and<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.229> forth<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and so forth so there you go we can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.870 
and so forth so there you go we can
change<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.130> amount<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.850> though<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:19.229> can

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
change this amount of time though we can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.170 
change this amount of time though we can
make<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.509> shorter<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.430> fits<00:01:23.909> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
make time shorter so that more fits on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.560 
make time shorter so that more fits on
the<00:01:24.360> screen<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:25.400> we<00:01:26.400> could<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.850> larger<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the screen or we could make it larger so

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.340 
the screen or we could make it larger so
that<00:01:27.990> let<00:01:28.350> less<00:01:28.740> fits<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> screen<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.350> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that let less fits on the screen and you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.810 
that let less fits on the screen and you
would<00:01:31.530> probably<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.579> smaller

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
would probably want to make it smaller

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.620 
would probably want to make it smaller
if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.009> wide<00:01:35.700> overview<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
if you want to get a wide overview of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.050 
if you want to get a wide overview of
your<00:01:37.350> entire<00:01:37.680> sequence<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
your entire sequence or as much of the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
your entire sequence or as much of the
sequence<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> could<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> would

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
sequence as you could and you would

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.280 
sequence as you could and you would
probably<00:01:41.130> want<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> larger<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
probably want to make it larger if you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.920 
probably want to make it larger if you
want<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:44.000> detail<00:01:45.000> work<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> particular

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
want to do detail work on a particular

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
want to do detail work on a particular
little<00:01:46.590> place<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
little place like right here I want to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
little place like right here I want to
do<00:01:48.360> something<00:01:48.390> special<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> want<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> make

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
do something special and I want to make

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.649 
do something special and I want to make
sure<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.340> doing<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.880> exactly<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.540> right

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sure I'm doing it in exactly the right

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.679 
sure I'm doing it in exactly the right
place<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.799> might<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.460> zoom<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
place then you might want to zoom out a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:03.340 
place then you might want to zoom out a
bunch<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> also<00:02:00.530> modify<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> size<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
bunch so you can also modify the size of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
bunch so you can also modify the size of
channels<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.590> well<00:02:04.619> by<00:02:05.430> using<00:02:05.729> these<00:02:06.060> other

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
channels as well by using these other

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
channels as well by using these other
zoom<00:02:06.600> tools<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.469> could<00:02:07.649> make<00:02:07.799> them

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
zoom tools so you could make them

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.639 
zoom tools so you could make them
shorter<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> fit<00:02:10.080> more<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.500> them

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
shorter so that you can fit more of them

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.400 
shorter so that you can fit more of them
on<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:11.009> screen<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.540> larger<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
on your screen or larger so that you can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
on your screen or larger so that you can
see

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
see

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.510 
see
each<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.280> individually<00:02:14.760> better<00:02:16.520> another

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
each one individually better another

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
each one individually better another
thing<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.030> these<00:02:18.720> channel<00:02:19.140> buttons

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
thing is these channel buttons

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680
