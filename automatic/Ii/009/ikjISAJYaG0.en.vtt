another nail tutorial today this is
another<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.269> techniques<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.870> I

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
another one of the techniques that I

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.999 
another one of the techniques that I
really<00:00:10.349> love<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.540> pretty<00:00:13.009> simple

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
really love to do it it's pretty simple

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.790 
really love to do it it's pretty simple
but<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.700> does<00:00:14.940> take<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.509> lot<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.750> time<00:00:15.990> that's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
but it does take a lot of time that's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.640 
but it does take a lot of time that's
the<00:00:16.920> only<00:00:17.100> thing<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.660> it's<00:00:18.660> also<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the only thing and it's also about the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.080 
the only thing and it's also about the
time<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> data<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> bird<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.760> likes

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
time of data that the bird really likes

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120 
time of data that the bird really likes
to<00:00:21.300> sing<00:00:21.510> her<00:00:21.630> song<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.170> if<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.500> hear<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.949> song

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to sing her song so if you hear the song

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.790 
to sing her song so if you hear the song
it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.269> bird<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> she<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.590> behind

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it is the bird and she is right behind

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
it is the bird and she is right behind
you<00:00:26.250> guys<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.240> gonna<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.420> louder

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you guys so it's gonna be louder

up and then also we're going to need a
makeup<00:01:05.549> sponge<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.799> I've<00:01:07.799> found<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
makeup sponge now I've found that if you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.230 
makeup sponge now I've found that if you
use<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.299> edge<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.950> it's

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
use the edge here that's when it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.340 
use the edge here that's when it's
pre-cut<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:13.260> tends<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.869> break<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:16.140> as

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pre-cut it tends to not break down as

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
pre-cut it tends to not break down as
easily<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.310> pull<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> apart<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
easily if you pull it apart like this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
easily if you pull it apart like this
and<00:01:18.900> rip<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.920> end<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and rip it and you use this end when you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.140 
and rip it and you use this end when you
start<00:01:21.270> dabbing<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.340> polish<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> sticky<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
start dabbing in the polish it sticky a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.870 
start dabbing in the polish it sticky a
little<00:01:24.869> piece<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.350> require<00:01:25.740> effort<00:01:25.880> look

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
little piece which require effort look

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.080 
little piece which require effort look
what<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.290> pieces<00:01:28.579> can<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> come<00:01:29.909> off

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
what the little pieces can like come off

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
what the little pieces can like come off
and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.450> little<00:01:30.570> chunks<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.229> nails

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and you get little chunks on your nails

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
and you get little chunks on your nails
so<00:01:31.979> she<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.490> does<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.759> likely<00:01:33.090> tell<00:01:33.299> shhh

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
so she really does not likely tell shhh

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.569 
so she really does not likely tell shhh
touched<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.130> within<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.640> hand<00:01:36.170> dang<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
touched that one within my hand dang it

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.609 
touched that one within my hand dang it
so<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.909> take<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.420> sponge<00:01:40.110> here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
so I'm going to take this sponge here

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.450 
so I'm going to take this sponge here
and<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.310> break<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.229> into<00:01:43.229> pieces<00:01:43.860> now

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and just break it off into pieces now

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
and just break it off into pieces now
you<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.790> won't<00:01:45.180> necessarily<00:01:45.329> use<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you don't won't necessarily use all of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.149 
you don't won't necessarily use all of
these<00:01:46.500> pieces<00:01:46.909> um<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
these pieces um but that way you know I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.880 
these pieces um but that way you know I
have<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.909> later<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.680> cut

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
have some more for later now you can cut

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
have some more for later now you can cut
these<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:53.939> precise<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
these you can be more precise about it

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.760 
these you can be more precise about it
but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.680> matters

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
but I really don't think it matters

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
but I really don't think it matters
whether<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.250> cut<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.759> tear<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.780> you're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
whether you cut or tear because you're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
whether you cut or tear because you're
really<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> use<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.520> side

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

that you really utilize your whole
sponge<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> big<00:02:07.229> piece<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> then

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
sponge if you use a big piece and then

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
sponge if you use a big piece and then
it<00:02:08.160> dries<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> can't<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it dries out and then you can't use it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
it dries out and then you can't use it
later<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
later and you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.640 
later and you
you've<00:02:10.880> just<00:02:11.120> wasted<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.600> sponge<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.290> next

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
you've just wasted a sponge the next

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.950 
you've just wasted a sponge the next
color<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:13.070> is<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:14.000> yodel<00:02:14.630> me<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.840> my

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
color up is going to be yodel me on my

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.620 
color up is going to be yodel me on my
cell<00:02:15.230> from<00:02:15.440> OPI<00:02:15.830> since<00:02:16.190> its<00:02:16.880> kind<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.240> next

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
cell from OPI since its kind of the next

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.230 
cell from OPI since its kind of the next
step<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.320> from<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.950> teal<00:02:21.950> color<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.940> looks<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
step up from that teal color it looks a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.620 
step up from that teal color it looks a
little<00:02:23.330> dark<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.260> more<00:02:25.330> sheer<00:02:26.330> than

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
little dark but this is more sheer than

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.110 
little dark but this is more sheer than
you<00:02:26.750> think<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> bottle<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.370> will

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
you think it is in the bottle so it will

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.600 
you think it is in the bottle so it will
work<00:02:29.360> for<00:02:29.720> our<00:02:29.870> next<00:02:30.050> step<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.530> here<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
work for our next step up here and I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.390 
work for our next step up here and I
just<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:32.210> paint<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.140> either<00:02:33.410> paper<00:02:33.740> or<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.220> paper

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.830 
sally hansen and i'm just going to get a
different<00:03:24.190> sponge<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.300> use<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.660> same

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
different sponge you can use the same

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.390 
different sponge you can use the same
sponge<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:26.440> i<00:03:26.560> would<00:03:26.709> use<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> different<00:03:27.220> end

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
sponge just i would use a different end

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430 
sponge just i would use a different end
when<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.270> use<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.540> same<00:03:28.720> into<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.290> just

depends actually let's go and do this
see<00:03:30.940> how<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.150> works<00:03:31.330> using<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.140> same<00:03:32.319> sponge

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
see how this works using the same sponge

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.810 
see how this works using the same sponge
the<00:03:32.709> whole<00:03:32.860> time<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.160> might<00:03:33.280> actually<00:03:33.430> help

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
the whole time it might actually help

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.710 
the whole time it might actually help
with<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.330> gradient<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:36.090> same<00:03:37.090> things<00:03:37.390> start

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
with the gradient so same things start

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:49.790 
with the gradient so same things start
from<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.959> tip<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.850> then<00:03:40.060> work<00:03:40.300> your<00:03:40.330> way<00:03:40.570> down

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.650 

ok<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.950> next<00:03:50.980> color<00:03:51.459> on<00:03:51.730> our<00:03:51.910> gradient<00:03:52.239> fade

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
ok the next color on our gradient fade

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.440 
ok the next color on our gradient fade
is<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.230> be<00:03:53.320> Russian<00:03:53.800> Navy<00:03:54.010> from<00:03:54.510> OPI<00:03:57.450> all

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
is going to be Russian Navy from OPI all

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.600 
is going to be Russian Navy from OPI all
right<00:03:58.690> get<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.110> on<00:03:59.200> make<00:03:59.410> sure<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.590> get<00:04:00.370> the

right get it on make sure you get the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.850 
right get it on make sure you get the
excess<00:04:01.030> off<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:02.019> I'm<00:04:02.200> going<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.380> really<00:04:02.560> focus

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
pool here see how it's pretty sheer when

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.409 
pool here see how it's pretty sheer when
I<00:04:35.770> start<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.100> Pat<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.400> off<00:04:36.610> right<00:04:36.820> up<00:04:36.970> right

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
I start to Pat it off right up right

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:47.110 
I start to Pat it off right up right
there<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.150> we'll<00:04:40.570> just<00:04:41.310> dabble<00:04:42.310> that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.060 

actually<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.380> glitter<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:48.889> much

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
actually I like that glitter so much

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.710 
actually I like that glitter so much
that<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.310> went<00:04:49.520> ahead<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:50.000> painted<00:04:50.600> that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
that I went ahead and just painted that

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.750 
that I went ahead and just painted that
whole<00:04:50.990> glitter<00:04:51.320> over<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.979> top<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.370> this<00:04:52.520> nail

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
whole glitter over the top of this nail

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.460 
whole glitter over the top of this nail
so<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.389> its<00:04:53.570> sheer<00:04:53.840> but<00:04:54.050> it's<00:04:54.169> all<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.440> way

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
so that its sheer but it's all the way

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.050 
so that its sheer but it's all the way
through<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:55.310> think<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.610> hide<00:04:55.820> all<00:04:55.970> the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
through and I think it's hide all the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.490 
through and I think it's hide all the
colors<00:04:56.360> together<00:04:56.540> really<00:04:56.810> well<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.229> I'm<00:04:57.350> just

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.170 
colors together really well so I'm just
going<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.190> on<00:04:58.370> me<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.639> rest<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:59.030> my

going to do that on me the rest of my

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.270 
going to do that on me the rest of my
fingers<00:04:59.240> here<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.199> again<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.919> laser
