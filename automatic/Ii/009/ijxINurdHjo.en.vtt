00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 today I will introduce you on the 4th 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 4 2 so the 4 4 ​​2 is one of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.589
 most classical formations in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.929
 the history of football 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 so overall the training is very 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 complete with several game projects 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 possible age deep a long game 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 a game based on the centers everything is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.340
 possible with this training 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.010
 so this training was very used 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.439
 in football a few years ago 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 but fashion has changed and today 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 a lot more host training for a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.410
 game with a system with a single 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.059
 point especially the 4 3 3 that is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.450
 become one of the reference trainings 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.910
 so offensively this training you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 offers a lot of possibilities with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 a game based on the centers ie 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 that your eccentric backgrounds will go up 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.469
 attention by the DC rather middle 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.520
 side offensive and not tickets 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 what is the difference so a medium 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.020
 offensive side seeks him rather the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.090
 decisive pass while the winger himself 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.809
 come back from the surface for eventually 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.879
 to score goals 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 so the idea is to bring up his 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 attacking midfielder and wait or 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 so instead of waiting for a medium 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 central rises to be able to play 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 depth so looking for a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.270
 goes deep with one of the two 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.869
 attackers in the flaws of this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.420
 training 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.299
 it is a game not very fast because mine 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 you have to wait for the calls 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.020
 must wait for the call from the middle 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 aggressive 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.470
 or even from the middle and this 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360
 game is also not ideal with regard to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 regards ball possession since 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.700
 you can possibly move on 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 from the middle but it lacks a player in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.229
 this area so the area where has leader of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.970
 game is normally to be able to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.590
 rotate the balloon more 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 effective 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.899
 so overall it's a training that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.479
 has the flaws of its qualities in the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.630
 sense where where the game you can 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.799
 develop is a fairly complete game but 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.970
 you can not really go deeper 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.490
 no game project 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.560
 except perhaps the tactics of centering 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.840
 which is however a stick hard enough to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 set up and what failure to render 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.740
 very quickly the ball to the opponent 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 in case of ball losses so 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.000
 now as far as the aspect 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.250
 defensive 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 it remains quite strong since the mac 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.150
 side media so are placed 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.970
 relatively low and can therefore quite 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.590
 easily fall back defensively but 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.260
 in case of counter attack it becomes 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 more complicated because there is no 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 actual turrets to hold 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.670
 the hut behind and the curtain of the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.580
 middle may not be so that's enough 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.010
 easily the lack of turns she has here 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.820
 an important role as 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.590
 Normally we can use this medium 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.870
 defensive precisely to make up for a 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.270
 possible pressing that is to say that you 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 can go out the central defender she 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.050
 is in the laundry of the ball carrier and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.780
 at the same time put your medium 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.620
 defensive in central defense what 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.930
 allows to contain the attacking opponent 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.230
 here it is not the case that is to say that 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 the slightest mistake is fatal to you if 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.170
 the opposing striker does one one that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.050
 normally ends he will find himself 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.910
 automatically in firing position is at 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:26.769
 note also that both spaces indicated 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.489
 so will also be pretty vulnerable in 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.810
 the case where the side would be mounted 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.100
 which would leave us simply 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.489
 the two central circles 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.519
 so here I think I have pretty much 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.630
 all said thank you for having followed this 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.630
 little show and see you soon
