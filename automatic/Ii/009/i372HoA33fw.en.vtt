and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.240> mainly<00:01:42.420> mainly<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and I think it's mainly mainly because I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.340 
and I think it's mainly mainly because I
pride<00:01:43.799> myself<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.310> being<00:01:44.369> able<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.909> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
place so anyway well I think it's really

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029

simple<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.079> other<00:02:07.259> maybe<00:02:07.560> sound

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
simple and it kind of other maybe sound

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.559 
simple and it kind of other maybe sound
a<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.280> esoteric<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> be

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
a little esoteric but I think it's to be

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.380 
a little esoteric but I think it's to be
the<00:02:09.690> best<00:02:09.869> person<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.470> item

the best person I can be item

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.550 
the best person I can be item
at<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.660> time<00:02:11.890> because<00:02:12.890> sometimes<00:02:13.340> that's<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:14.560> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
at a time because sometimes that's a you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.170 
at a time because sometimes that's a you
know<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.709> don't<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:16.069> exactly<00:02:16.790> what<00:02:17.030> my

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
know I don't know exactly what my

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.910 
know I don't know exactly what my
mission<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.870> or<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.380> don't<00:02:18.590> want<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.830> get

too heady about that sort of thing

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.970
