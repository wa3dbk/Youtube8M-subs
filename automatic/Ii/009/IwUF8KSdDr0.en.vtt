into the eleventh on the B string
followed<00:04:12.540> by<00:04:12.750> nine

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:37.309 

football<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.670> new<00:04:17.850> key

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.140 

now<00:04:38.319> this<00:04:39.160> was<00:04:39.310> gonna<00:04:39.460> end<00:04:39.669> differently<00:04:40.000> as

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
now this was gonna end differently as

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.779 
now this was gonna end differently as
well<00:04:40.330> instead<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.780> doing<00:04:40.870> this

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
well instead of doing this

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.929 
well instead of doing this
it's<00:04:43.789> just<00:04:43.939> gonna<00:04:44.089> do<00:04:44.240> 11<00:04:44.779> on<00:04:44.869> the<00:04:45.520> b2<00:04:46.520> 11<00:04:46.849> on

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
it's just gonna do 11 on the b2 11 on

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.339 
it's just gonna do 11 on the b2 11 on
the<00:04:46.999> G<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:49.330> resolve<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.479> on<00:04:50.629> a<00:04:50.689> 14th<00:04:51.139> fret<00:04:51.289> on

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
the G and resolve it on a 14th fret on

00:04:51.349 --> 00:05:01.410 
the G and resolve it on a 14th fret on
the<00:04:51.469> B<00:04:51.559> string

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.120 

so<00:05:02.420> you'll<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.050> melody<00:05:03.230> twice<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.920> key

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
so you'll do the melody twice and a key

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.780 
so you'll do the melody twice and a key
then<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.430> goes<00:05:04.550> left<00:05:04.910> after<00:05:05.300> this

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
then it goes left after this

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.230 
then it goes left after this
the<00:05:07.790> previously

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.340 

all<00:05:12.240> right<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:12.720> basically<00:05:13.020> you're<00:05:13.230> just

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
all right so it's basically you're just

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.690 
all right so it's basically you're just
gonna<00:05:13.440> be<00:05:13.590> going<00:05:13.740> through<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.250> play<00:05:14.460> in

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
gonna be going through that you play in

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.450 
gonna be going through that you play in
each<00:05:14.970> key<00:05:15.240> twice<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.860> go<00:05:17.100> from<00:05:17.280> one<00:05:17.430> to

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
each key twice and I just go from one to

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.920 
each key twice and I just go from one to
the<00:05:17.550> next<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.030> just<00:05:18.210> seems<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:18.570> keep<00:05:18.720> going

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
the next and it just seems to keep going

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.480 
the next and it just seems to keep going
because<00:05:19.170> it<00:05:19.350> Keys<00:05:19.560> whatever<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.010> jump<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.460> a

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
because it Keys whatever you jump to a

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.340 
because it Keys whatever you jump to a
new<00:05:20.520> key<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.030> just<00:05:21.210> kind<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.450> opens<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:21.990> back<00:05:22.170> up

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
new key it just kind of opens it back up

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.790 
new key it just kind of opens it back up
again

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
again

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.200
