00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
have a problem with it because I want

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.680 
have a problem with it because I want
the<00:01:34.680> volume<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> most<00:01:36.030> part<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.510> does

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
the volume but for the most part it does

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.270 
the volume but for the most part it does
have<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.260> know<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.560> curls<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
volume and I like it like that so just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
volume and I like it like that so just
take<00:01:40.770> your<00:01:40.800> time<00:01:41.190> when<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:41.670> taking<00:01:42.000> your

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
twists out because it does make a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.420 
twists out because it does make a
difference<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> outcome<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.120> your<00:01:45.360> look
