dinosaurs and we will be starting off
with<00:00:10.590> quiver<00:00:11.519> stuff<00:00:12.420> let<00:00:12.630> me<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:13.019> fold<00:00:13.349> this

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
with quiver stuff let me just fold this

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.080 
with quiver stuff let me just fold this
back<00:00:13.769> step<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.460> fold<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.210> back<00:00:16.080> tires<00:00:16.440> back

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
back step to fold the back tires back

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
back step to fold the back tires back
step<00:00:18.090> 3<00:00:18.830> pull<00:00:19.830> these<00:00:20.010> around<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.769> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
step 3 pull these around and out and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.140 
step 3 pull these around and out and
then<00:00:22.920> step<00:00:23.609> 4<00:00:24.019> hold<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.529> step<00:00:25.920> 5<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.670> pull

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
then step 4 hold it up step 5 just pull

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
then step 4 hold it up step 5 just pull
the<00:00:27.180> arch<00:00:27.510> down<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.500> clover

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the arch down and then you have clover

00:00:28.859 --> 00:01:02.299 
the arch down and then you have clover
in<00:00:29.189> back<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.140> now<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.199> will<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:01:01.309> now

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in back but now we will be going to now

in back but now we will be going to now
go<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.680> splitter<00:01:04.939> just<00:01:05.939> pull<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> side

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
go on to splitter just pull the side

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.390 
go on to splitter just pull the side
down<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> step<00:01:07.590> 1<00:01:07.830> step<00:01:08.369> 2<00:01:08.430> folders<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.890> step<00:01:10.890> 3

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
down the step 1 step 2 folders up step 3

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:22.280

fold<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> head<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:15.020> step<00:01:18.080> 4<00:01:21.020> pull<00:01:22.020> those

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fold the head down step 4 pull those

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
fold the head down step 4 pull those
like<00:01:23.009> full<00:01:23.580> bloom<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.229> this
