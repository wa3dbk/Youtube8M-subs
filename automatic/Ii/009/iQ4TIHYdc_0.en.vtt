we've<00:05:39.280> got<00:05:39.430> Optifine<00:05:39.969> which<00:05:40.840> will<00:05:40.990> let<00:05:41.080> us

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
we've got Optifine which will let us

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.070 
we've got Optifine which will let us
zoom<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.740> decrease<00:05:42.219> lag<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.789> also<00:05:42.909> adds<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.599> lot

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
zoom and decrease lag it also adds a lot

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.580 
zoom and decrease lag it also adds a lot
of<00:05:44.229> new<00:05:44.349> settings<00:05:46.650> longer<00:05:47.650> endure<00:05:47.949> distance

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
of new settings longer endure distance

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.170 
of new settings longer endure distance
it's<00:05:50.590> really<00:05:50.860> useful<00:05:51.009> not<00:05:51.340> overall<00:05:53.729> so<00:05:54.729> I<00:05:55.029> hope

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180
