let us assume that a hook has been
dislodged<00:00:19.439> from<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.070> carrier<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.140> track<00:00:23.450> the

putting this hook back into the carrier

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.730 
putting this hook back into the carrier
you<00:01:02.370> simply<00:01:03.000> face<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:05.240> flat<00:01:06.240> part<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you simply face the flat part of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130 
you simply face the flat part of the
geared<00:01:08.040> section<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> hook<00:01:09.000> towards<00:01:09.930> the

carrier<00:01:10.590> towards<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> spacer<00:01:12.259> push<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.590> at

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
carrier towards the spacer push it in at

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.660 
carrier towards the spacer push it in at
an<00:01:13.979> angle<00:01:14.329> so<00:01:15.329> that<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.719> lip<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.460> hook

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
an angle so that the lip of the hook

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
an angle so that the lip of the hook
goes<00:01:18.090> under<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.170> white<00:01:19.470> part<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:21.020> carrier

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
goes under the white part of the carrier

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.590 
goes under the white part of the carrier
and<00:01:22.940> put<00:01:23.940> it<00:01:24.060> into<00:01:24.450> place<00:01:24.720> snap<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and put it into place snap it in

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.510 
and put it into place snap it in
sometimes<00:01:28.600> these<00:01:29.200> hooks<00:01:29.619> when<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.189> put<00:01:30.399> them

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
sometimes these hooks when you put them

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.460 
sometimes these hooks when you put them
back<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.970> place<00:01:31.000> are<00:01:31.659> at<00:01:32.320> an<00:01:32.470> angle<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:35.110> isn't

assembly if this is out of alignment you

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:59.340 
assembly if this is out of alignment you
simply<00:01:51.700> rotate<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.450> wand<00:01:57.840> until<00:01:58.840> all<00:01:59.049> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
simply rotate the wand until all the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.940 
simply rotate the wand until all the
other<00:01:59.500> hooks<00:01:59.830> stop<00:02:00.490> turning<00:02:01.289> you<00:02:02.289> rotate<00:02:02.799> it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
other hooks stop turning you rotate it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.180 
other hooks stop turning you rotate it
back<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.580> other<00:02:03.700> direction<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.890> past

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
back in the other direction and go past

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.570 
back in the other direction and go past
its<00:02:09.519> point<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.000> resistance<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.519> the

its point of resistance back to the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420 
its point of resistance back to the
center<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.299> you'll<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:14.350> see<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.830> both

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
center and you'll now see that both

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.080 
center and you'll now see that both
books<00:02:15.700> are<00:02:16.080> aligned
