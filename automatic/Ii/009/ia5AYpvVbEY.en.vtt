00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.930 

think<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.510> sim<00:00:58.899> aligns<00:00:59.170> our<00:00:59.609> supply<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.670> best

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.880 
time he'll he'll give it to you it's
that<00:01:56.930> personal<00:01:57.380> touch

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
that personal touch

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.490 
that personal touch
that<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.450> cellphone<00:01:59.810> really<00:02:00.140> delivers

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
that that that cellphone really delivers

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
that that that cellphone really delivers
on<00:02:00.650> especially<00:02:00.860> as<00:02:01.190> coming<00:02:01.729> from<00:02:01.760> one<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.210> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
on especially as coming from one of the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.499 
on especially as coming from one of the
targets<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:06.670> think<00:02:07.670> really<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.270> fact

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
targets I think really it's the fact

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.180 
targets I think really it's the fact
that<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.929> go<00:02:09.050> over<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.410> can<00:02:09.649> shake<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> Keys

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
that I can go over I can shake a Keys

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.220 
that I can go over I can shake a Keys
hand<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.480> hang<00:02:11.660> out<00:02:11.780> at<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.020> place

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
hand I can I can hang out at this place

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.810

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
and I can actually go through symbols

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.400 
and I can actually go through symbols
myself<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.840> they<00:02:14.930> don't<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.260> what<00:02:15.350> I
