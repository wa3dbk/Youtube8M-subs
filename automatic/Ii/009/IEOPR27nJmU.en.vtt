00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.260 

I<00:03:25.020> think<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.190> reason<00:03:26.520> why<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.790> was<00:03:27.240> so

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
I think the reason why it was so

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.820 
I think the reason why it was so
important<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:27.900> us<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.140> bring<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.470> bolshoi

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
important for us to bring the bolshoi

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.300 
important for us to bring the bolshoi
back<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.340> because<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:31.410> many<00:03:31.530> years<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:32.160> big

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
back is because for many years the big

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.160 
back is because for many years the big
ballet<00:03:32.580> companies<00:03:33.150> from<00:03:33.450> Russia<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.110> from

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
ballet companies from Russia and from

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.740 
ballet companies from Russia and from
Europe<00:03:34.530> have<00:03:35.010> bypass<00:03:35.550> Toronto<00:03:36.210> they<00:03:36.480> played

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
Europe have bypass Toronto they played

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.930 
Europe have bypass Toronto they played
New<00:03:36.960> York<00:03:37.260> Boston<00:03:37.620> they<00:03:38.160> played<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.610> Orange

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
New York Boston they played in Orange

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.510 
New York Boston they played in Orange
County<00:03:39.290> they've<00:03:40.290> gone<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.650> Ottawa<00:03:41.100> they

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
County they've gone to Ottawa they

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.310 
County they've gone to Ottawa they
didn't<00:03:41.790> go<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> Montreal<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.840> never<00:03:43.020> see

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
didn't go to Montreal and we never see

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.460 
didn't go to Montreal and we never see
them<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.340> when<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.360> opportunity<00:03:45.720> arose

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
them and so when this opportunity arose

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.410 
them and so when this opportunity arose
it<00:03:46.860> was<00:03:47.010> something<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.490> we<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.640> couldn't

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
it was something that we just couldn't

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.270 
it was something that we just couldn't
turn<00:03:48.570> down<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.170> were<00:03:49.290> very<00:03:49.530> very<00:03:49.710> excited

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
turn down and we were very very excited

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.020 
turn down and we were very very excited
to<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:51.030> able<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.300> bring<00:03:51.540> them

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
to be able to bring them

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.790 
to be able to bring them
of<00:03:52.330> course<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.660> kirov<00:03:53.020> was<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.380> last<00:03:53.620> year

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
of course the kirov was here last year

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.490 
of course the kirov was here last year
with<00:03:54.130> this<00:03:54.520> one<00:03:54.910> lake<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.870> it's<00:03:56.050> great<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.350> be

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
with this one lake so it's great to be

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.680 
with this one lake so it's great to be
able<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.800> compare<00:03:57.190> these<00:03:57.430> two<00:03:57.700> great<00:03:58.180> Russian

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
able to compare these two great Russian

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.870 
able to compare these two great Russian
ballet<00:03:58.870> companies<00:03:59.470> doing<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.370> same<00:04:00.610> work

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
ballet companies doing the same work

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.490 
ballet companies doing the same work
which<00:04:01.210> of<00:04:01.240> course<00:04:01.390> will<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:01.780> very<00:04:01.900> different

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
which of course will be very different

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.340 
which of course will be very different
interpretations<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.060> hope<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.780> lot<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350
