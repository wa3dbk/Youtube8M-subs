00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.950 

okay<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.590> certainly<00:00:02.040> get<00:00:02.250> chilly<00:00:02.639> out<00:00:02.880> and<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:03.960 
okay I certainly get chilly out and the

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.539 
okay I certainly get chilly out and the
heat<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> old<00:00:04.529> jeep<00:00:04.740> was<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> little<00:00:05.339> weak

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
heat in the old jeep was a little weak

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.099 
heat in the old jeep was a little weak
so<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.879> figured<00:00:06.180> I'd<00:00:06.269> flush<00:00:06.539> out<00:00:06.749> the<00:00:06.930> heater

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
so I figured I'd flush out the heater

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.459 
so I figured I'd flush out the heater
cart<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:08.370> I've<00:00:08.580> seen<00:00:08.820> quite<00:00:09.509> a<00:00:09.660> few<00:00:09.750> people's

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
cart now I've seen quite a few people's

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.430 
cart now I've seen quite a few people's
ideas<00:00:11.429> for<00:00:11.820> doing<00:00:12.089> this<00:00:12.299> some<00:00:12.929> people<00:00:13.080> just

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
ideas for doing this some people just

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.919 
ideas for doing this some people just
took<00:00:13.559> garden<00:00:14.040> hose<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.879> air<00:00:15.179> hose<00:00:15.450> I've

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
took garden hose to it and air hose I've

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.810 
took garden hose to it and air hose I've
seen<00:00:16.230> people<00:00:17.039> dump<00:00:17.279> coke<00:00:17.609> into<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:19.160> well<00:00:20.160> I'm

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
seen people dump coke into it well I'm

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820 
seen people dump coke into it well I'm
not<00:00:20.939> singing<00:00:21.240> anyways<00:00:21.660> right<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.170> wrong<00:00:22.380> but

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
not singing anyways right or wrong but

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.410 
not singing anyways right or wrong but
this<00:00:23.099> is<00:00:23.210> my<00:00:24.210> way<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.449> doing<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.070> got<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.420> pipe

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this is my way of doing it got this pipe

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.050 
this is my way of doing it got this pipe
contraption<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.769> got<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> garden

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
contraption here it's got got a garden

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.579 
contraption here it's got got a garden
hose<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> goes<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.779> side<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.259> air<00:00:31.380> hose

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
hose it goes to one side and an air hose

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.659 
hose it goes to one side and an air hose
it<00:00:31.740> goes<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.160> side<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it goes to the other side you got a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.610 
it goes to the other side you got a
valve<00:00:32.879> on<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.390> side<00:00:33.629> and<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.899> valve<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.350> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
valve on this side and a valve on this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.069 
valve on this side and a valve on this
side<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.129> pressure<00:00:35.370> gauge<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.239> see

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
side and a pressure gauge so you can see

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.770 
side and a pressure gauge so you can see
how<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.379> pressure<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.980> put<00:00:38.219> into<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
how much pressure you're put into it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
how much pressure you're put into it
normally<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.899> cooling<00:00:40.230> systems<00:00:40.710> run<00:00:41.010> 1015

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
normally your cooling systems run 1015

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.540 
normally your cooling systems run 1015
psi<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> don't<00:00:43.410> want<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.739> putting<00:00:44.010> 60

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
psi so you don't want to be putting 60

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
psi so you don't want to be putting 60
psi<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.420> eater<00:00:45.629> core<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.170> blow<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> up

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
psi in your eater core you blow it up

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
psi in your eater core you blow it up
and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.030> real<00:00:48.210> fun<00:00:48.449> job<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.989> change

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and then that's a real fun job to change

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.979 
and then that's a real fun job to change
it<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:52.010> it's<00:00:53.010> depending<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.570> wouldn't

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it so it's depending you know I wouldn't

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
it so it's depending you know I wouldn't
push<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.440> than<00:00:55.530> about<00:00:55.649> 20<00:00:55.890> pounds<00:00:56.190> through

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
push more than about 20 pounds through

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
push more than about 20 pounds through
it<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.960> whatever<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.620> own<00:00:58.739> risk<00:00:58.920> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it but do whatever at your own risk I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
it but do whatever at your own risk I
guess<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> do

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
guess so the first thing I'm going to do

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
guess so the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> turn<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> air<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.519> and<00:01:02.910> I'm

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is I'm going to turn the air on and I'm

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.120 
is I'm going to turn the air on and I'm
going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> push<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> antifreeze<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
going to push out the antifreeze that's

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:16.260 
going to push out the antifreeze that's
in<00:01:05.310> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.930 

add<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.780> little<00:01:17.080> water<00:01:17.230> to<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:20.370> just<00:01:21.370> go<00:01:21.550> go<00:01:21.730> turn

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
add a little water to it just go go turn

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.210 
add a little water to it just go go turn
the<00:01:21.970> water<00:01:22.180> on

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the water on

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.700 
the water on
okay<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:24.250> got<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.610> water<00:01:24.760> on<00:01:25.030> now<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.590> were

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
okay I got the water on now so you were

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:40.110 
okay I got the water on now so you were
getting<00:01:29.860> some<00:01:30.100> pressure<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:32.130> yummy

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.050 

now<00:01:41.120> I<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.600> hooked<00:01:41.870> up<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.440> I'm<00:01:42.560> pushing

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
now I have this hooked up so I'm pushing

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.430 
now I have this hooked up so I'm pushing
backwards<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.570> way<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.840> coolant<00:01:45.260> would

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
backwards to the way the coolant would

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.250 
backwards to the way the coolant would
normally<00:01:45.890> flow<00:01:46.690> we're<00:01:47.690> about<00:01:48.020> five<00:01:48.350> psi<00:01:49.040> so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
normally flow we're about five psi so

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.230 
normally flow we're about five psi so
drink<00:01:51.260> your<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.680> little<00:01:51.920> more<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.580> little

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
drink your up a little more a little

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.219 
drink your up a little more a little
more<00:01:53.480> air<00:01:53.870> or<00:01:55.120> water<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:59.479> do<00:01:59.720> this<00:01:59.930> for<00:02:00.170> a

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
more air or water then do this for a

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.540 
more air or water then do this for a
little<00:02:00.470> bit<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.010> should<00:02:01.040> just<00:02:01.400> about

little bit and that should just about

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.400 
little bit and that should just about
take<00:02:01.910> care<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.820> there<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:05.900> go

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
take care of it and there we go

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.830 
take care of it and there we go
