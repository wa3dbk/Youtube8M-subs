00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.640
 the calm 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.590
 today we are going to talk about fair-play that is 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.750
 the shooting franchise in the first 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.790
 person who leaves you free in a world 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.950
 huge to fulfill certain missions 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.270
 or do what you want and in 2012 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.640
 surprised many with the launch 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.650
 far cry 3 that brought pretty ideas 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.040
 daring and had a villain 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.040
 psychopath 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.690
 two years later he returns with far cry 4 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.670
 but knowing that it is the same study 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.680
 that developed in highly criticized accept 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.480
 you need and we will see how below 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
 this time the game takes place in the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.380
 fictitious nation of kiryat in the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.910
 Himalayas you are an American tourist who 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.920
 is only visiting to spread the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.270
 friendships of your mother at the beginning of 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.370
 game is presented to you the villain of the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.230
 history the dictator pain means his 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.479
 presence is disturbing and promises to be 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 a memorable character but soon after 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.570
 from the start it basically disappears until 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.810
 the end of the adventure which I 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 disappointed a bit then you are released in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.619
 the immense world where you must help a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.880
 group of rebels to liberate the country there 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.680
 certain missions in which you have to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.479
 choose between two of the leaders which 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.009
 It affects your reputation and gives you the illusion 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.470
 that your decision has an impact 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.240
 significant in the plot the missions 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 of the campaign are quite varied and 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.930
 I never felt bored these go from 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.149
 protect a Buddhist temple from the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.070
 military travel to the high snow of 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.810
 one and little oxygen experience the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.030
 strange hallucinations where you see all 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.710
 the colorful things jump behind a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.869
 plane to rescue valuable information 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.580
 and even travel to a mystical world where 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.979
 fights together with a white tiger against 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 warriors made of smoke what great is 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.100
 that the controls in the mechanics you 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.600
 allow you to play stealthily and 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.979
 quickly change a style where 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.330
 shoot from all sides as if 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.890
 you were crazy 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.180
 but the most fun experience is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.650
 explore the open world that you 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.600
 provide dozens of activities 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.120
 secondary like climbing mountains 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.170
 release all of control find all 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.660
 the hidden masks 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.490
 fight in the battle arena tear 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800
 the government posters eliminate the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.510
 enemy patrols and survive the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.550
 wild animals that attack you like 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 tigers eagles coyotes and even fish 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.030
 carnivores after a few hours 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.100
 complete cta to one of the points 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.780
 marked on your map becomes a vice and 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.750
 makes the hours fly by with 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.010
 the traditional excuse of a more mission 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.780
 now one of my favorite parts of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 game is to be able to release these fields 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 military that are protected by 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.700
 soldiers and you can face it like 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.040
 you can use submachine guns 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 flame-throwing grenades and also reinforcements 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.880
 to use bait to attract 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.830
 predators but the fire rewards you for 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.900
 not to be detected and here is where the arc 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.650
 and the arrow come into play that is my 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 favorite part 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.190
 So here I am going and here is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 someone there someone taking something in the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.680
 cook and I'm going to take out look an arrow 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.510
 to aim and a gesture has nba 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.400
 but if you do not like stealth and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 they want something much more action can 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.000
 You climb on an elephant for example 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.540
 each state on the name of 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.549
 one and I'm going to attack these enemies and for 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.549
 throw him arrows or throw him and grenades 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.810
 and then I can grab and just 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.430
 dump all the vehicles and crush them 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.430
 as if they were pancakes 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.629
 in the game allows you to basically do 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.879
 what they want 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.620
 the graphics are very well achieved with 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.359
 spectacular nature views and a 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.859
 lots of details 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.269
 in fact the developers traveled 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.269
 up to pall to make sure that the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.650
 level of authenticity is appropriate 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.030
 now they have a friend with whom 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.950
 I recommend playing the cooperative mode 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.959
 with which you can pass the campaign mode 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.519
 in record time and in fact there are missions 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.310
 specials that require the help of 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.810
 someone else the multiplayer mode you know 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.849
 presents three types of confrontation 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.230
 for two teams on a non-symmetric map 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.239
 which have interesting 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.069
 variants like power and love animals 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.169
 wild to attack from time to time 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.970
 I found some box and strange textures 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.189
 but happily matching runs fluid in 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.840
 every moment I felt that the story could 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.579
 take advantage a little better and several of 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.799
 the characters feel forced or 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.299
 is exaggerated but these are points 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.489
 minors for an experience that makes 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.390
 so many things well and offers them more than 30 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.609
 hours of fun 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.500
 it is true that this delivery offers something 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.209
 very similar to what we saw in far cry 3 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.760
 but I feel I've done be 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.140
 refined that formula of allowing you to do 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.420
 whatever you want when you want 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.770
 It turns out to be very funny in conclusion 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.290
 Farc 4 is one of the most 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 large more varied and better presented 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.830
 of what I've seen in 2014 and it's 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.750
 proof that you use can make good 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.750
 games when you take the time of vido
