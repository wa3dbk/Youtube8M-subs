theirs<00:00:21.710> is<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.039> best<00:00:22.070> quality<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.179> if<00:00:23.269> some

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
theirs is the best quality and if some

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.540 
theirs is the best quality and if some
of<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.929> don't<00:00:23.990> know<00:00:24.410> what<00:00:24.650> puffy<00:00:25.070> paint<00:00:25.339> is
