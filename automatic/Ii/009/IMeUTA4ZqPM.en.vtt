obviously there's nothing I can do now I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.470 
obviously there's nothing I can do now I
tend<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.650> give<00:02:57.129> YouTube<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.640> lot<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.940> crap<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.209> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
tend to give YouTube a lot of crap and I

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.539 
tend to give YouTube a lot of crap and I
know<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.629> lot<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.840> other<00:02:59.049> people<00:02:59.170> do<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:00.069> I

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
know a lot of other people do and I

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.520 
know a lot of other people do and I
don't<00:03:00.730> mean<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:00.970> because<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:02.319> really

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
don't mean to because it's really

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.039 
don't mean to because it's really
pointless<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.519> blame<00:03:04.389> something<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:04.989> just

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
pointless to blame something that's just

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.930 
pointless to blame something that's just
out<00:03:05.379> of<00:03:05.769> your<00:03:05.799> control<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.579> your<00:03:06.730> like<00:03:06.849> I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
out of your control out of your like I

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.000 
out of your control out of your like I
cannot<00:03:07.269> control<00:03:07.690> like<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.500> YouTube<00:03:08.769> sub

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
cannot control like the YouTube sub

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.589 
cannot control like the YouTube sub
boxes<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.519> processing<00:03:10.150> or<00:03:10.329> anything

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
boxes are the processing or anything

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.629 
boxes are the processing or anything
like<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.889> really<00:03:12.129> does<00:03:12.310> me<00:03:12.459> no<00:03:12.489> good

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
like that so it really does me no good

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.940 
like that so it really does me no good
to<00:03:12.970> complain<00:03:13.120> about<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:13.659> so<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.409> figure

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
I just won't even though I probably will

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.710
