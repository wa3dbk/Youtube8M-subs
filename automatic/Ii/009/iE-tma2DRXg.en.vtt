00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
follow-up to my previous video that I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.459 
follow-up to my previous video that I
made<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:11.540> topographic<00:00:12.540> maps<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.320> bass

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
made on topographic maps for bass

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.970 
made on topographic maps for bass
anglers<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.299> last<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
anglers and in this last video that I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
anglers and in this last video that I
think<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.760> did<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> fairly<00:00:18.180> good<00:00:18.420> job<00:00:18.449> actually

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
think I did a fairly good job actually

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
think I did a fairly good job actually
pointing<00:00:19.590> out<00:00:19.710> some<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> features<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pointing out some of the features you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.939 
pointing out some of the features you
can<00:00:21.289> identify<00:00:22.490> using<00:00:23.510> topographic<00:00:24.510> maps

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
can identify using topographic maps

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.320 
can identify using topographic maps
especially<00:00:25.949> those<00:00:26.130> topographic<00:00:26.789> maps<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
especially those topographic maps that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.679 
especially those topographic maps that
were<00:00:27.510> created<00:00:27.810> before<00:00:28.429> the<00:00:29.480> lake<00:00:30.480> or

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
were created before the lake or

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.260 
were created before the lake or
reservoir<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.740> constructed<00:00:32.270> which

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
reservoir was actually constructed which

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.170 
reservoir was actually constructed which
is<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.620> example<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> am<00:00:35.820> showing<00:00:35.850> you

or choosing apart but another type of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620 
or choosing apart but another type of
map<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.119> referred

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
map that you can use one that's referred

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.070 
map that you can use one that's referred
to<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> lake<00:01:25.229> fishing<00:01:25.560> map<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> use

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to as a lake fishing map that I use

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.179 
to as a lake fishing map that I use
actually<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.869> complement<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.650> map<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
actually as a complement to this map and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually as a complement to this map and
why<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.840> total<00:01:34.560> graphic<00:01:34.829> maps<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
why use you know total graphic maps to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
why use you know total graphic maps to
help<00:01:35.610> again<00:01:36.619> extract<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.770> additional

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
help again extract some additional

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.020 
help again extract some additional
information<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> may<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.570> contained<00:01:40.439> on

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
information that may not be contained on

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.170 
information that may not be contained on
the<00:01:42.170> typical<00:01:43.170> lake<00:01:43.380> maps<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.009> find<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.000> then

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the typical lake maps you find and then

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
the typical lake maps you find and then
I'll<00:01:45.270> annotate<00:01:45.720> those<00:01:45.930> maps<00:01:46.229> accordingly

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I'll annotate those maps accordingly

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.789 
I'll annotate those maps accordingly
okay<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.880> let<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.030> switch<00:01:48.329> over<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
okay but let me switch over here and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.370 
okay but let me switch over here and
show<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.939> section<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> lake

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
show you what the section of the lake

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
show you what the section of the lake
map<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.100> Lake<00:01:53.310> looks<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
map for this Lake looks like and here it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.889 
map for this Lake looks like and here it
is<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.320> very<00:01:55.500> simple<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.729> dark<00:01:57.060> black<00:01:57.509> line

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
is it is very simple the dark black line

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.830 
is it is very simple the dark black line
here<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.560> indeed<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.310> shoreline<00:01:59.790> okay<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
here is indeed the shoreline okay and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080 
here is indeed the shoreline okay and
I'm<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> switch<00:02:01.770> back<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> topo<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
I'm going to switch back to the topo and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.560 
I'm going to switch back to the topo and
you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.590> how<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
you know just think of how this

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.520 
you know just think of how this
shoreline<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.049> come<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> through

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
shoreline is going to come in through

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.660 
shoreline is going to come in through
here<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.429> nice

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
here I just going to have this nice

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.150 
here I just going to have this nice
little<00:02:08.879> nose<00:02:09.810> thing<00:02:10.259> coming<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
little nose thing coming out here and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.590 
little nose thing coming out here and
following<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.120> client

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
following this client

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.490 
following this client
in<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.110> along<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.300> blue<00:02:15.300> arrowed<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
in here along these blue arrowed or the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.190 
in here along these blue arrowed or the
tips<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.800> those<00:02:16.950> blue<00:02:17.190> arrows<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:18.840> get<00:02:19.020> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
tips of those blue arrows we get that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.830 
tips of those blue arrows we get that
same<00:02:19.500> feature<00:02:19.770> playing<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.690> look

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
same feature playing in here if we look

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.260 
same feature playing in here if we look
offshore<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.460> extended

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
offshore we then have that extended

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.990 
offshore we then have that extended
feature<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.340> okay<00:02:26.340> that's<00:02:26.640> actually

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
feature out here okay that's actually

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
feature out here okay that's actually
being<00:02:27.270> shown<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.780> topographic<00:02:28.410> map<00:02:28.620> as

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
being shown on the topographic map as

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
being shown on the topographic map as
kind<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.940> contour<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> ones<00:02:30.930> out

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
kind of this contour and the ones out

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.280 
kind of this contour and the ones out
beyond<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.710> those<00:02:32.460> are<00:02:32.640> underwater<00:02:33.150> today<00:02:33.480> all

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
beyond it those are underwater today all

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.380 
beyond it those are underwater today all
right<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.430> some<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.700> advantages<00:02:35.850> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
right what are some of the advantages of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.600 
right what are some of the advantages of
a<00:02:36.540> lake<00:02:36.720> map<00:02:36.960> well<00:02:37.320> it's<00:02:37.590> simple<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:38.370> one

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
a lake map well it's simple have one

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.640 
a lake map well it's simple have one
thing<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.180> most<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.570> maps<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.080> they

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
thing I like in most like maps is they

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.070 
thing I like in most like maps is they
do<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.800> much<00:02:41.070> better<00:02:41.100> job<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:42.150> highlighting

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
do a much better job of highlighting

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.170 
do a much better job of highlighting
usually<00:02:43.860> where<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.070> old<00:02:44.400> creek<00:02:44.730> channel<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
usually where the old creek channel is

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.570 
usually where the old creek channel is
which<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.390> what<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.900> thing<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:47.250> light

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
which is what this thing is this light

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.750 
which is what this thing is this light
blue<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.210> gray<00:02:48.830> stripe<00:02:49.830> running<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.490> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
blue like gray stripe running down the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.480 
blue like gray stripe running down the
center<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.810> lake<00:02:52.020> okay<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.400> this

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
center of the the lake okay and in this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.430 
center of the the lake okay and in this
case<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.390> road<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.810> was<00:02:54.930> coming<00:02:55.290> in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
case we have the road that was coming in

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.700 
case we have the road that was coming in
down<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.520> ramp<00:02:56.820> area<00:02:57.030> today<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:58.170> also<00:02:58.350> see

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
down to the ramp area today we also see

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.380 
down to the ramp area today we also see
where<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:58.980> projected<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.670> road<00:02:59.970> coming

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
where they projected that road coming

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.800 
where they projected that road coming
across<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:01.800> reservoir<00:03:02.460> as<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.120> exists<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:03.660> as

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
across the reservoir as it exists as as

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
across the reservoir as it exists as as
was<00:03:04.170> also<00:03:04.590> shown<00:03:04.830> on<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.010> topographic<00:03:05.610> map

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
was also shown on the topographic map

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.170 
was also shown on the topographic map
okay<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.800> contours<00:03:08.430> here<00:03:08.820> have<00:03:09.000> been

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
okay the contours here have been

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.900 
okay the contours here have been
interpreted<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.200> actually<00:03:10.980> show<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.250> depths

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
interpreted to actually show the depths

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.970 
interpreted to actually show the depths
as<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.330> close<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.990> opposed<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.770> land

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
as a close as opposed to the land

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.980 
as a close as opposed to the land
elevation<00:03:14.250> which<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.270> what<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.870> be

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
elevation which is what is going to be

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.900 
elevation which is what is going to be
shown<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.260> those<00:03:16.590> older<00:03:17.040> topographic<00:03:17.700> maps

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
shown on those older topographic maps

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.020 
shown on those older topographic maps
that<00:03:18.630> represent<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.850> topography<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that represent the topography of the

area before the map the excuse me the
reservoir<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.150> actually<00:03:24.510> constructed<00:03:25.730> again

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
reservoir is actually constructed again

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.790 
reservoir is actually constructed again

can tell you in this part of this Cove
that<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.900> trees<00:03:43.110> are<00:03:43.290> still<00:03:43.470> standing

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
that there the trees are still standing

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.210 
that there the trees are still standing
but<00:03:44.130> all<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.790> trees<00:03:45.000> down<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:45.570> were<00:03:45.720> removed

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
but all the trees down here were removed

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.400 
but all the trees down here were removed

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
mentioned that when they took down all

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.870 
mentioned that when they took down all
these<00:03:57.630> trees<00:03:58.100> they<00:03:59.100> actually<00:03:59.460> brought<00:03:59.610> those

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
these trees they actually brought those

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.530 
these trees they actually brought those
down<00:04:00.240> to<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:01.460> original<00:04:02.460> creek<00:04:02.700> channel<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
down to the original creek channel the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.460 
down to the original creek channel the
edge<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.990> in<00:04:04.190> created<00:04:05.190> large<00:04:05.400> brush<00:04:05.940> piles

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
edge of it in created large brush piles

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.110 
edge of it in created large brush piles
this<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.920> location<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.640> one<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.910> those

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
this is the location of one of those

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.000 
this is the location of one of those
brush<00:04:09.420> piles<00:04:09.690> now<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.680> could<00:04:10.890> have

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
brush piles now you could have

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.740 
brush piles now you could have
speculated<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:12.000> when<00:04:12.450> they<00:04:12.570> took<00:04:12.690> down

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
speculated that when they took down

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.320 
speculated that when they took down
these<00:04:13.110> trees<00:04:13.170> down<00:04:13.680> here<00:04:14.100> they<00:04:14.460> probably<00:04:14.820> put

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
these trees down here they probably put

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.420 
these trees down here they probably put
them<00:04:15.660> somewhere<00:04:15.990> out<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.470> area<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.340> of

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
them somewhere out in this area and of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.650 
them somewhere out in this area and of
course<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.820> have<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> depth<00:04:18.239> finder<00:04:18.390> you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
course if you have a depth finder you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.320 
course if you have a depth finder you
can<00:04:18.780> go<00:04:18.870> out<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.020> find<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.530> pretty<00:04:19.710> quickly

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
can go out and find that pretty quickly

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.880 
can go out and find that pretty quickly
but<00:04:21.330> in<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.510> map<00:04:21.780> they're<00:04:22.290> showing<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
but in this map they're showing you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.270

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
directly so keep this in mind

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.250 
directly so keep this in mind
