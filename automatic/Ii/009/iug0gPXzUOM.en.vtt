00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
stairwell where you can just make it

echo off the walls because you want to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.279 
echo off the walls because you want to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
get a very clear tone stay there and

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.650 
get a very clear tone stay there and
just<00:02:22.010> embrace<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.910> fact<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.480> you're

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
just embrace the fact that you're

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.449 
just embrace the fact that you're
following<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> footsteps<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.460 
following in the footsteps of the
greatest<00:02:25.790> food<00:02:26.000> players<00:02:26.239> ever<00:02:26.569> when<00:02:27.170> they<00:02:27.319> go

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
greatest food players ever when they go

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740 
greatest food players ever when they go
into<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.829> foggy<00:02:28.250> area<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> food<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.720> e

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
into the foggy area of the food the e

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.479 
into the foggy area of the food the e
natural<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.530> sounded<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.280> had<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
natural that sounded like it had a

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.080 
natural that sounded like it had a
funnel<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.930> know<00:02:33.049> just<00:02:33.799> open<00:02:34.700> up<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
funnel in it you know just open up and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.530 
funnel in it you know just open up and
let<00:02:35.739> experimentation<00:02:36.739> begin

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.309 

so<00:02:44.379> we're<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.739> start<00:02:45.069> with<00:02:45.420> be5<00:02:46.420> bb5

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
so we're going to start with be5 bb5

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.149 
so we're going to start with be5 bb5
he's<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.159> be<00:02:48.519> fun<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.909> etc<00:02:49.450> etc<00:02:49.560> my<00:02:50.560> normal

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
he's like a be fun a etc etc my normal

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.039 
he's like a be fun a etc etc my normal
long<00:02:51.400> tone<00:02:51.700> method<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.569> get<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
long tone method and so I get to the

00:02:53.049 --> 00:04:58.030 
long tone method and so I get to the
foggy<00:02:53.470> area

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.310 

now<00:04:59.040> here<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.340> come<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.850> first<00:05:00.150> foggy<00:05:00.990> as

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
now here I come to the first foggy as

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.350 
now here I come to the first foggy as
possible<00:05:01.860> note<00:05:02.040> on<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.310> food<00:05:02.550> it's<00:05:02.760> not<00:05:03.120> your

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
possible note on the food it's not your

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.800 
possible note on the food it's not your
fault

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
fault

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.530 
fault
it's<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.920> squeeze<00:05:05.340> part<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:06.060> this<00:05:06.150> to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
it's the squeeze part of this to

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.530 
it's the squeeze part of this to
distribute<00:05:07.230> my<00:05:07.380> zest<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:08.310> this<00:05:08.550> part<00:05:08.880> around<00:05:09.060> F

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
distribute my zest in this part around F

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.520 
distribute my zest in this part around F
and<00:05:09.870> E<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:11.010> sound<00:05:11.400> becomes<00:05:11.880> more<00:05:12.530> squeezed

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
and E the sound becomes more squeezed

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.310 
and E the sound becomes more squeezed
physically<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.810> more<00:05:16.140> difficult

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
physically so that it is more difficult

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.890 
physically so that it is more difficult
to<00:05:16.800> get<00:05:17.100> an<00:05:17.310> open<00:05:17.700> and<00:05:17.820> free<00:05:18.120> sound<00:05:18.419> than<00:05:18.660> it<00:05:18.750> is

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
to get an open and free sound than it is

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.690 
to get an open and free sound than it is
with<00:05:19.080> just<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.410> few<00:05:19.650> fingers<00:05:20.070> on<00:05:20.280> you're<00:05:20.490> sort

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
with just a few fingers on you're sort

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970 
with just a few fingers on you're sort
of<00:05:20.760> getting<00:05:21.030> around<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.630> maximum<00:05:22.200> amount

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
of getting around to the maximum amount

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.790 
of getting around to the maximum amount
of<00:05:23.160> keys<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.120> are<00:05:24.180> down<00:05:24.480> so<00:05:25.260> when<00:05:25.470> you<00:05:25.590> get<00:05:25.770> to

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
of keys that are down so when you get to

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.880 
of keys that are down so when you get to
the<00:05:26.100> foggy<00:05:26.580> foggy<00:05:27.030> area<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:27.900> suggest<00:05:28.650> two

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
the foggy foggy area I suggest two

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.960 
the foggy foggy area I suggest two
things<00:05:29.150> one<00:05:30.150> is<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.810> just<00:05:31.080> release<00:05:31.710> relax<00:05:32.580> and

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
things one is to just release relax and

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.610 
things one is to just release relax and
experiment<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.770> other<00:05:34.979> is<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.729> try

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
experiment and the other is to try

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.500 
experiment and the other is to try
uncovering<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.979> blowhole<00:05:38.550> by<00:05:38.760> rolling<00:05:39.390> the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
uncovering the blowhole by rolling the

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.580 
uncovering the blowhole by rolling the
flute<00:05:39.810> out<00:05:40.050> one<00:05:40.940> extra<00:05:41.940> half<00:05:42.540> millimeter<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.560> a

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
flute out one extra half millimeter to a

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.090 
flute out one extra half millimeter to a
millimeter<00:05:44.040> then<00:05:44.700> you<00:05:45.090> think<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.660> need<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.140> as

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
millimeter then you think you need to as

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.140 
millimeter then you think you need to as
you<00:05:47.550> roll<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.540> flute<00:05:48.810> out<00:05:49.460> you<00:05:50.460> will<00:05:50.610> uncover

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
you roll the flute out you will uncover

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.360 
you roll the flute out you will uncover
the<00:05:51.750> hole<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.530> sound<00:05:52.800> will<00:05:53.010> become

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
the hole and the sound will become

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.840 
the hole and the sound will become
brighter<00:05:53.930> okay<00:05:54.930> so<00:05:55.620> I'm<00:05:55.890> going<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.100> do<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.580> was

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
brighter okay so I'm going to do it was

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.790 
brighter okay so I'm going to do it was
a<00:05:56.880> fluke<00:05:57.180> party<00:05:57.840> rolled<00:05:58.110> in<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.470> you'll<00:05:58.590> hear

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
a fluke party rolled in and you'll hear

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:07.210 
a fluke party rolled in and you'll hear
how<00:05:58.830> foggy<00:05:59.280> it<00:05:59.550> becomes<00:05:59.910> after<00:06:00.300> G

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.800 

because<00:06:08.220> it's<00:06:08.400> so<00:06:08.580> roles<00:06:08.880> in<00:06:09.150> I'm<00:06:09.330> literally

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
because it's so roles in I'm literally

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.930 
because it's so roles in I'm literally
squishing<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.710> out<00:06:10.920> it<00:06:11.220> can't<00:06:11.520> it<00:06:11.790> can't

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940
