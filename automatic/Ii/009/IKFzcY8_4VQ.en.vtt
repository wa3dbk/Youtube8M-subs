grenades right now so yeah it has been

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.709 
grenades right now so yeah it has been
quite<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.700> while<00:01:29.969> since<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.630> recorded<00:01:31.439> before

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
quite a while since I recorded before

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.359 
quite a while since I recorded before
and<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.229> ages<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.069> into<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and it just take ages to get into the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.480 
and it just take ages to get into the
bridge<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.959> not<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.380> lot<00:01:37.829> much<00:01:38.069> of<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> good

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
bridge so it's not a lot much of a good

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.899 
bridge so it's not a lot much of a good
glitch<00:01:39.709> but<00:01:40.709> it's<00:01:40.860> good<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> high

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
glitch but it's good to get to high

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.499 
glitch but it's good to get to high
levels

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
levels

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.810 
levels
and<00:01:44.509> if<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.049> prepared<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:45.590> wait<00:01:45.859> quite<00:01:46.759> a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
and if you prepared to wait quite a

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.240 
and if you prepared to wait quite a
while<00:01:47.289> and<00:01:48.289> it's<00:01:48.469> good

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.450

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
can see they will just stop eventually

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.590 
can see they will just stop eventually
killing<00:01:59.990> each<00:02:00.170> other<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.240> I'll<00:02:02.240> show<00:02:02.570> you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.710 
killing each other and I'll show you
that<00:02:02.900> as<00:02:03.890> I'll<00:02:04.550> pause<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:05.030> again<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.450> income

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
that as I'll pause it again and income

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.199 
that as I'll pause it again and income
Bakula<00:02:06.080> okay<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.149> now<00:02:09.009> there's<00:02:10.009> only<00:02:10.250> one<00:02:10.880> two

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
Bakula okay so now there's only one two

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.120 
Bakula okay so now there's only one two
zombies<00:02:11.390> left<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.319> birth<00:02:12.470> crawlers<00:02:13.100> but

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
zombies left and the birth crawlers but

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.110 
zombies left and the birth crawlers but
just<00:02:16.130> wait<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> minute<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.760> you'll<00:02:16.850> see<00:02:17.030> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
just wait a minute and you'll see that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.190 
just wait a minute and you'll see that
they<00:02:17.270> do<00:02:17.330> just<00:02:17.690> kill<00:02:17.870> each<00:02:17.959> other

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500 

so<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> best<00:02:22.099> thing<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.580> glitch<00:02:22.879> would

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
so the best thing for this glitch would

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
so the best thing for this glitch would
be<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> leave<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.680> come<00:02:24.739> back<00:02:25.069> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
be just to leave it and come back a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
couple of hours later on by the way it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.759 
couple of hours later on by the way it
will<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.680> good<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.519> play<00:02:31.849> online<00:02:32.330> with<00:02:33.230> three

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769
