00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 in this video tutorial, I'll show you how 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.250
 stir stained paint and how 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.420
 get us 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 color gel for this we need in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.850
 ordinary acrylic stained paints 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 paint it can be by the way in 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 fluorescent paint and glitter well 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 the same bank on the gel so I have dripped 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.920
 a little stained paint here to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.989
 approximately show how it should look 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.989
 here's a drop 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 we will need something like this two 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.050
 tassels I type so here are two such 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.670
 drops 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.670
 but such a drop of stained glass 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 that's what we got is beautiful stained glass 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 pink 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.910
 such a drop 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.850
 if you want to add sparkle there 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:41.040
 please, everything is in your hands like 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.259
 says take and add a little bit well 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.280
 something like this is not necessary because 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.479
 that then he will look ugly 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.479
 quite a bit 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.979
 everything is now ready to use very 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.979
 beautiful pink stained glass 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:21.190
 stained paint firm definitely can not 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.410
 say what's stuck here all now 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.950
 I'll try it all tear off to you 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.950
 say firms here is an eye art written 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.730
 I hope you can see 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.960
 one such jar costs about 90 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:47.830
 rubles to you, I have enough on the table much more 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:55.480
 so here we take this drop on 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.670
 orange stick like this 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.130
 then two brushes as I showed you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 two such big drops we need 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.590
 stir 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.860
 also add beautiful sparkles i love 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.160
 immediately drop stained glass pour sparkles 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160
 there 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.460
 the sparkles are green 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.330
 a drop of gel I will take a little bit 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:40.900
 for I will not take no green not particularly 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:45.960
 need for example it turns out this 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.960
 beautiful lime green apple color 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:03.890
 cool further how to achieve us how 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:08.570
 we can get more accurate color gel 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.490
 use polycolor paints 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.989
 if you want if you do not have the usual 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.220
 acrylics what we do with me 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.410
 let's say here 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.960
 moon or firm color purple 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.960
 acrylic paints for nail art and wrote 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.690
 ordinary not cheap 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.080
 bought a hundred years ago and recently decided 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:47.360
 try to stir behind the gel 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.360
 see what happens bridge look 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.130
 take a little gel 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.990
 and about this is how it is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.600
 it only gets mixed up 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.260
 quickly 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.080
 because the paint still dries out 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.380
 if for the calculation, then the paint is smaller 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.750
 lay to dry well otherwise 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.960
 then you can never dries 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.490
 even preload after 20-30 seconds looking 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.010
 What kind of lamp do you have ? 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.350
 nice 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.370
 dark purple cues to make it 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:40.630
 lighter such a currant with sour cream 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:45.010
 just add white you can buy 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.800
 fluorescent paint here i have 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:52.450
 ferrari stand on yellow 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.870
 poisonous such a color to paint them I 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.120
 I do not advise they draw very badly 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.280
 transparent colors but for gel it 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.320
 gorgeous colors also take a little bit and 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.740
 so on the tip for droplets us this 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.740
 there will be enough even you can still reads 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 So 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.849
 also suitable for calculations in 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:20.169
 ultraviolet light is very beautiful 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.940
 poisonous still can be added there 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:29.030
 some powder to glow in 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:34.789
 dark phosphorus will generally 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:37.039
 cool here so you mixed two 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.389
 colors of stained glass with sparkles and two 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.440
 colored gel 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.650
 have done in what one priority is all this 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.770
 very simple you just need a transparent 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.560
 gel paints stained 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.090
 and ordinary sparkles don't need any 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:02.020
 sets to buy it all done very 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:02.020
 easy thanks for watching everyone bye
