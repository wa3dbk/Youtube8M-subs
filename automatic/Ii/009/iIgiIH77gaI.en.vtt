00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.920
 we have many that recommends the space 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.660
 of the channel where good in the end you know 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.810
 something a bit like your camel's 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.119
 staff and I bring you goods very very 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.519
 juicy I can assure you that the shit 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.490
 today is really a real good 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.070
 Jewel is about cost with online and 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.410
 Sweet mom calls where I start with 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.000
 this game first thing is that it's free and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.400
 I do not know about you but me when something 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.410
 it's free is really set up a store 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.020
 campaign the pants in fact is 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 so free that we do not even have to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.350
 confirm the email that normally 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.030
 often send our tray 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.219
 mail to make sure we're not 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.590
 a robot or anything like that 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.809
 that really is free I really screw up 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 in everything and it's also that he calls more 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.840
 attention taking into account the level that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.609
 has this game in terms of 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.109
 do not trust much of the 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.239
 graphic section that you see in your 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.920
 screens in the video because to be able 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.920
 recording it turns out that my computer is not 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.239
 no rocket precisely 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.490
 so I could record it because I had to download 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.590
 the graphic quality of the game to the minimum 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.030
 if we play it high that I've seen it 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.890
 and I could play it when I have not been 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.080
 recording is really a level 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.909
 surprising considering that it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.310
 it's about a free game with good 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.690
 light effects good textures is not that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 be at the level of the latest games 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.799
 generation that there are lately consoles 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.009
 or in PC of course but really 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.049
 stands out among all the amalgam that there 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.700
 of free games on the market and not 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.990
 only that it shows that the game has very 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.659
 good level in terms of presentation 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 also in animations in light effects 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.729
 and explosions in motion the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.110
 character and in general is a game that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.429
 It feels really good when we have it 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.200
 in your hands when we are 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.060
 controlling you notice that it's okay 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.009
 programmed for you to understand me when 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.780
 we put in coverage reacts well 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.179
 the character and obeys well our 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.549
 orders looks properly points 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.319
 with the viewer correctly in addition 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.299
 the animations are very good those of 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.190
 character we can jump over 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.530
 obstacles we can slide through 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.390
 below them and also curiously 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 I think it's one of the first owls that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.850
 I see that movement is really useful 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.470
 to slip 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.479
 the truth is that there is a level 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.400
 impressive in that sense the game and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.620
 does not disappoint at any time in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 about playability so you can understand 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.280
 a little more of what is going all this is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.780
 it's about a shooting game like 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.940
 you can see on your screens very 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459
 tactics is a game especially tactical 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.840
 in which to move madly from 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.670
 front and against the enemy team 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.709
 normally what he is going to do is that we 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.800
 they burn immediately the best way to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.260
 act the best way to win games 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 is trying to flank trying to use 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.980
 the special abilities trying 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
 play a little smarter 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.670
 like the same word lloyd and trying 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.709
 play a little more tactically by 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.060
 example the snipers against them 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.110
 we do not have any opportunities 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 we try to make war of trenches 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.440
 with them is one of the things that how 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.970
 this game works because really 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 It has a lot of depth in terms of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.940
 gameplay we have three classes between 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.170
 those who choose specialist assault and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 sniper or reconnaissance like 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.549
 you want to call him and each one has several 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.380
 ways to play and that's what really 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.330
 I am loving this game all 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.130
 the ways of playing that exist in a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.630
 principle we have all that tactics that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.250
 I told you at the beginning but to give it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.970
 a little more sauce the matter for 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.670
 do it a little 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.320
 interesting each class apart from having 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.840
 his specific weapons has two 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.210
 special species skills that are 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.330
 very interesting and that in the end they bring 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.280
 a lot of depth gameplay to the game 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.260
 for example the assault class can 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.330
 use a shield to charge against 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.250
 the enemies or a heat device 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.170
 so that they have to cover himself 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 I find the time very interesting 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 specialist class skills 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.960
 which is mostly what I've been 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.810
 using me for example that the shield 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.520
 ax with which for a while we can 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.530
 assault practically without any danger 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.880
 the enemy positions yes that is true 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.709
 that there are ways to counteract it as 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.300
 for example, getting close and hitting 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.860
 in a strip the one that has the shield or 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.720
 using grenades but it gives us a lot 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.090
 advantage or also for example another 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.160
 skill of the specialist class is 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 black out or blackout that basically 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.820
 deactivates team skills 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.410
 contrary as for example a shield to 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.450
 say we deactivate it from enemies it 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.310
 is completely in panties and 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.290
 it usually means that we drag you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.450
 right away these skills bring 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.220
 much point of interest to the game bring 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.790
 many ways to play 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.110
 and they have a lot more sauce but 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.240
 at the same time it has a very use 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.610
 limited then we can not use the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.040
 discretion aside another fundamental point 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.710
 of the game is teamwork 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.110
 really when they bleach us or when 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.030
 they get us from a point 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.710
 from a point completely 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.360
 unprotected because we have nothing to 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.770
 do and that often depends on that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 our colleagues then protect the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.430
 other sides whereby by those who 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.380
 can access and protect the most points 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.570
 sensitive then I tell you all this 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.040
 mainly because one of the points 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.800
 negative that the game may have on 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.300
 everything if you're not a super player anymore 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.890
 alternative but you're the typical 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.810
 counter-strike player game by the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.760
 style is that it can be frustrating 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.100
 that remove a little the negative point 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.200
 the key so that it is not frustrating 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.670
 is to understand how it works especially 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.400
 play as a team with friends well 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.110
 communicated and try to use the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.610
 skills that we have and 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.730
 make a good team do a good 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.860
 composition among snipers 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.180
 jump players and specialists and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.650
 above all I consider myself the key to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.870
 done if you realize in the field I 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.580
 I'm playing with a good friend of mine 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.500
 is one of the key tips that you 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.230
 I wanted to give if you want to play this game 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.090
 playing with a friend is fundamental will be 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.250
 much easier to win of course and 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.450
 It will be much more fun as good 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.700
 guys that's all I wanted you 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.960
 say my final advice you see that 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.790
 I have not practically made jokes 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.200
 during the video because damn it is not 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.210
 I need you this video is already 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.560
 interesting enough only for the 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.260
 damn game what you have to do is 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.930
 run to download is the damn 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.790
 ghost recon online and play it later 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.220
 it would be good that good in vinaixa give me 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.800
 thanks maybe a like favorites 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.720
 because not because it costs nothing too 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.010
 It's free if you want but the truth is 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.660
 that it's really worth playing the 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.580
 guys from the heart I tell you 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.590
