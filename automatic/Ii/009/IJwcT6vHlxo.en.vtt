 We do not use chemical fertilizer at all 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.770
 It's no exaggeration to say that you raise grapes as they are.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.490
 I have to get the bottle back every day for three weeks. 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.070
 The yeast deposits will then accumulate in the bottleneck.
