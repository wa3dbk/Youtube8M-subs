00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 I can not upload any game however 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.970
 I bring you this little tutorial which 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 I will show you how to change the color 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.759
 from the eyes of any image either 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 his image or image of a friend etc 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 etc as well basically the first 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 what you have to do is remove the blockade 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.740
 the padlock here and drag it to the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.630
 trash can and second either with him 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.480
 with let's get them out of doing the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.300
 brochita and we will choose the color that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.630
 we want either a red here we want a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:47.810
 new layer and above we are going to color 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.810
 the area that we want to change color 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.200
 very well 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.890
 we just take a few small touches 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.890
 here 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.430
 removing what we do not want to be 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 paint 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.230
 and we already have the color changed nothing 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.230
 good nothing more 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 ok let's remove the side these things 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.280
 very well now that we have the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.960
 colored eye 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.799
 the next thing to do is take 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.049
 the layer and drag it down that 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.590
 way then just above the layer 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.000
 we have a bar that is normal and with 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 this is the only thing we are going to do 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.490
 let's change here and let's look towards 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.070
 down until a color remains which 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.970
 be seen 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 very well 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 this 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.650
 superimpose and we can put what 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.810
 it would be the option of super 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.090
 we choose color it has to be the color 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 the layer that has the color and we choose the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 option to superpose either super good 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.729
 you can actually choose the one 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.729
 you think or see that it looks better 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.729
 okay 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.490
 and can see you can make 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:24.210
 other color 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:24.210
 in superimpose down 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.130
 with the eraser they are simply going to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.250
 they are going to touch up the edges like this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.410
 that does not leave much of what is more or 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.430
 less crap about how to change the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.550
 eye color 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.280
 using photoshop good many 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.720
 thanks and it was a very short video 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.530
 how will they see someone is he 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.020
 the before and the after 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.970
 achieve a very simple way is not very 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.810
 difficult and can be done with almost 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.840
 anything with either the skin or eyes 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.100
 etc etc if you want I can give you a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.200
 small demonstration can be done 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.690
 also with the skin we save a green 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.069
 here like this 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.349
 and we started coloring 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.739
 as you will see I can also do this with 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.739
 the skin 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.330
 something like a hulk 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.890
 as you can see I can do this with the skin 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.890
 and with any kind of this one 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.380
 with any kind of 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.470
 go 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.960
 of image either 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.260
 an image of him an image of someone is 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.730
 You can make this change in this way 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.050
 for this video I hope you have an excellent 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.050
 the other day we goodbye
