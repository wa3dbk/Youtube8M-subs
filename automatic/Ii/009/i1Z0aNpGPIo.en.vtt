a<00:02:12.160> scout<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.630> double<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.110> phaeton<00:02:14.590> point

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
a scout so we double the phaeton point

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.090 
a scout so we double the phaeton point
five<00:02:15.190> seconds<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.820> one<00:02:16.030> second<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.510> vanish

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
five seconds up to one second of vanish

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.730 
five seconds up to one second of vanish
we<00:02:18.480> lowered<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> movement<00:02:20.050> speed<00:02:20.290> bonus<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
we lowered the movement speed bonus that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.220 
we lowered the movement speed bonus that
you<00:02:20.830> get<00:02:21.070> with<00:02:21.220> vanish<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.690> all<00:02:22.930> these

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
you get with vanish so this all these

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.870 
you get with vanish so this all these
things<00:02:23.290> allow<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:24.130> deal<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.640> Scout
