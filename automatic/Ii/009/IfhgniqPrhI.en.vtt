00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
anyway I'm sure but it was the fact that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
anyway I'm sure but it was the fact that
at<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.510> felt<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> clubs

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
at the time it's I felt that the clubs

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560 
at the time it's I felt that the clubs
where<00:00:43.829> most<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> clubs<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.239> were<00:00:45.329> around

where most of the clubs that were around

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
where most of the clubs that were around
in<00:00:45.930> general<00:00:46.649> car<00:00:46.829> tribes<00:00:47.100> especially<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
in general car tribes especially the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
in general car tribes especially the
Jaguar<00:00:48.030> ones<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.329> were<00:00:48.450> catering<00:00:49.200> much<00:00:49.500> more

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Jaguar ones they were catering much more

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
Jaguar ones they were catering much more
for<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.039> modern<00:00:50.250> customers<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> was

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
for more modern customers and that was

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380 
for more modern customers and that was
this<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> larger<00:00:52.699> populous<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.820> suppose<00:00:54.149> they

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this a larger populous I suppose they

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
this a larger populous I suppose they
felt<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.710> thought<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.129> just

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
felt and I thought there was just

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
felt and I thought there was just
nothing<00:00:56.399> being<00:00:56.699> focused<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> XK<00:00:57.809> owners

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
nothing being focused on the XK owners

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
nothing being focused on the XK owners
although<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:59.129> large<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.699> numbers<00:01:00.180> obviously

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
although not large in numbers obviously

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
although not large in numbers obviously
for<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.350> important<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.359> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
for me very important but I think I was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
for me very important but I think I was
been<00:01:03.629> learning<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> general<00:01:04.769> clubs<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
been learning the general clubs and the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.090 
been learning the general clubs and the
magazines<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.799> for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
magazines and so little out there for

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.770 
magazines and so little out there for
the<00:01:08.220> exponents<00:01:09.060> were<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:10.670> interested

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
the exponents were actually interested

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
the exponents were actually interested
so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.140> foolish<00:01:13.530> enough<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> say<00:01:14.250> okay

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so I was foolish enough to say okay

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.429 
so I was foolish enough to say okay
