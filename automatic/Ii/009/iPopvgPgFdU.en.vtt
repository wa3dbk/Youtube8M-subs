tech<00:00:50.340> we've<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.700> easy<00:00:51.000> v<00:00:51.149> rocker<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:52.199> keeps

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
tech we've got easy v rocker that keeps

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.900 
tech we've got easy v rocker that keeps
the<00:00:52.649> contact<00:00:53.039> points<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> ground

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the contact points up off the ground

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.639 
the contact points up off the ground
makes<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.570> loose<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> catch<00:00:55.289> free

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
makes them really loose and catch free

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
makes them really loose and catch free
we<00:00:56.219> also<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.670> feature<00:00:57.210> called<00:00:57.329> cruise

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we also have a feature called cruise

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
we also have a feature called cruise
control<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.710> helps<00:00:59.010> keep<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> edges<00:00:59.670> off

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
control which helps keep the edges off

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
control which helps keep the edges off
the<00:00:59.940> ground<00:01:00.149> even<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.719> further<00:01:00.930> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the ground even a little further so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
the ground even a little further so
makes<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.219> loose<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> you're<00:01:02.879> coming

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
makes it very loose that you're coming

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.429 
makes it very loose that you're coming
around<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.600> making<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:03.960> turns<00:01:04.199> you're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
around you're making your turns you're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.690 
around you're making your turns you're
not<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> catch<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.070> edge<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
not going to catch an edge and get that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480 
not going to catch an edge and get that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
designed for that beginner intermediate

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
designed for that beginner intermediate
rider<00:01:11.540> okay<00:01:12.540> Annie<00:01:13.640> what<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.210> about

rider okay Annie what about what about

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.200 
rider okay Annie what about what about
which<00:01:15.840> type<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> size<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:17.070> come<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
which type of size we come like the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.249 
which type of size we come like the
interest<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.960> 150<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.799> 149<00:01:20.369> 150<00:01:21.119> 5<00:01:21.479> 150

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
interest like 150 is 149 150 5 150

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.330 
interest like 150 is 149 150 5 150
sevens<00:01:22.909> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> volume<00:01:24.450> integral<00:01:25.040> we<00:01:26.040> offer<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
sevens on the volume integral we offer a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.760 
sevens on the volume integral we offer a
range<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:28.110> boards<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> clash

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
range so that the two boards the clash

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.280 
range so that the two boards the clash
of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> bullet<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.600> similar<00:01:30.600> construction

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
of the bullet are similar construction

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830 
of the bullet are similar construction
but<00:01:31.500> geared<00:01:31.829> towards<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:33.090> different<00:01:33.450> widths

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
but geared towards two different widths

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
but geared towards two different widths
so<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> clash<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> regular<00:01:35.490> width

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so the clash is more of a regular width

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179 
so the clash is more of a regular width
for<00:01:36.570> people<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.439> smaller<00:01:37.950> size
