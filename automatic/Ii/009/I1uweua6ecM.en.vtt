00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 I graduated from the São Paulo bridge. 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.979
 also in the year 2004 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.270
 today working almost as a student student 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.159
 in college getting lost 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.159
 or you can also have other job opportunities 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.079
 the cold spot network 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.519
 and the network because I ended up working on the university channel on tv points 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.060
 and then I had the chance to present a program called intact has a 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.360
 very striking passage college girl was the time of my work 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 of course completion 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.450
 that I decided to really dedicate myself I did not take anything like anything 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 simply as a job he decided to pick up and take the punishment harder than 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.830
 I wish everyone talked about how you can 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.480
 and to do a job on the headlines I did everything very alone in her 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 comment I go I was producing 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 took the camera intends to return to the west 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.190
 I later edited 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.400
 recorded interviews I prepared for her 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.190
 and in the end I also got to understand this concept 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 and it was very good because this comment 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.650
 it turned out to be my gateway to the globe 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 and then I told them what they ironies from the destination to the beach 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.970
 a person who ate my mother was left alone is an option that ended up knowing 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.480
 without wishing a publisher that from the globe tv 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.620
 that had team 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.520
 in 2007 if I live I really like it because he 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.390
 I used to do everything in him, everything I did was fun 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.600
 and this person ended up giving this dvd retro barcelona barcelos in the time of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.440
 profession reporter training 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.780
 and it was just what I profile that the captain is looking for a person 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.120
 hostage had a year of training 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
 that had 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.740
 so it was so marked 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 saw these 100 thousand dvds we talked 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 and then some time later he called me to be part of the team of the profession 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.049
 reporter glock in 2006 when people 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.969
 could be a picture in the fantastic this was a pretension was so I 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 I joined here is five years old. 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.049
 looks 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.489
 I can tell you that I do not expect you I do not expect the standard report 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.609
 who tries to copy the newscast to Switzerland seems to have a brother 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.119
 eike was not how I learned to do I think 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.779
 it becomes much easier when you do not repeat anything when you 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.689
 You're restricted, well laid out. You have to know what you're going to say, so you have to 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.769
 know that you will interview 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.959
 on the board unintentionally 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.760
 if you put your spout in a certain way to make a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 even at the time you edit this material 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.059
 Wednesday 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.179
 things that we're already seeing around here renée sena 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.839
 I'll tell you when I see a lot of trouble. 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.169
 I see that he ends up trying to be a copy of a newspaper. 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.919
 local and here today the student is not a professional yet the student he 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.149
 has high chances of dismissal for 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.409
 is often in the job market and will not have 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.340
 so I think the time to use a format a way of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.920
 do the interview, we'll get in the front 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.949
 I'm a way of talking about it in a way. 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.949
 interesting not to be this Friday after taking little 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.930
 the phrase that first thing if it were not the first student do because 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:42.959
 but this year 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.959
 the new version is going to hit nothing at times of hp this is an experience 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.010
 Yes, I did. 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.359
 it was a will 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.639
 mine and it was over later 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.369
 he bearing fruits 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:59.149
 then I think yes, I'm calm, I stayed here, I want what I need 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.539
 Anyone having killed a subject study understood the theme. 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:11.429
 ivy revealed that he was interviewed do not know who I want to show a house that the 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 z some way of 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.229
 dalonso marcela 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.569
 but thinking does pallina 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.779
 have the phone and call people 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.719
 to the search program 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.860
 that's how we can tell that the people that we get result 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.820
 so not only answer the phone and make paulo goes after the person bat 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.990
 at the door nothing better than personal contact for it 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.399
 press the step-by-step way forward to want to exit the camera 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.520
 always have to be theirs to make a list here at the end of the faith
