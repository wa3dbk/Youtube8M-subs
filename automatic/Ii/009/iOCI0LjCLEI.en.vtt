in<00:00:05.799> this<00:00:06.009> tutorial<00:00:06.189> the<00:00:06.939> machines<00:00:07.269> depicted

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
in this tutorial the machines depicted

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.480 
in this tutorial the machines depicted
may<00:00:07.870> not<00:00:08.049> actually<00:00:08.320> match<00:00:08.799> the<00:00:09.039> machines<00:00:09.400> that

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
may not actually match the machines that

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.820 
may not actually match the machines that
you<00:00:09.670> have<00:00:09.910> but<00:00:10.539> the<00:00:10.660> concepts<00:00:11.230> will<00:00:11.500> all<00:00:11.650> be

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
you have but the concepts will all be

here's an internal view of how to adjust

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:55.190 
here's an internal view of how to adjust
the<00:00:42.670> back<00:00:42.850> gate<00:00:43.090> as<00:00:43.210> well

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.260

notice the slots that the back gate is

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.690 
notice the slots that the back gate is
being<00:00:58.510> dropped<00:00:58.780> into<00:00:59.220> these<00:01:00.220> will<00:01:00.430> be<00:01:00.550> the

being dropped into these will be the
slots<00:01:00.940> that<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.300> would<00:01:01.420> use<00:01:01.630> to<00:01:01.930> count<00:01:02.170> when

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
slots that you would use to count when

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.389 
slots that you would use to count when
adjusting<00:01:03.460> for<00:01:03.640> different<00:01:03.910> products<00:01:05.399> notice

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
adjusting for different products notice

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.090 
adjusting for different products notice
the<00:01:06.549> adjustment<00:01:07.180> slots<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.720> machine<00:01:08.110> for

the bottom of the back gate these will

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.499 
the bottom of the back gate these will
also<00:01:11.560> be<00:01:11.770> used<00:01:12.249> when<00:01:12.850> adjusting<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.359> back

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
also be used when adjusting the back

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
properly adjust the back gate note the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.529 
properly adjust the back gate note the
spacing<00:01:22.799> between<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.039> bottle<00:01:24.789> and<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.329> back

spacing between the bottle and the back

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.529 
spacing between the bottle and the back
gate<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:27.340> spacing<00:01:27.759> is<00:01:28.240> an<00:01:28.990> improper<00:01:29.409> setup

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
gate this spacing is an improper setup

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.389 
gate this spacing is an improper setup
this<00:01:31.539> will<00:01:31.780> cause<00:01:32.020> your<00:01:32.499> machine<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:33.009> register

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
this will cause your machine to register

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.789 
this will cause your machine to register
sold<00:01:33.700> out<00:01:33.909> even<00:01:34.420> though<00:01:34.749> you<00:01:34.779> have<00:01:35.139> bottles<00:01:35.590> in
