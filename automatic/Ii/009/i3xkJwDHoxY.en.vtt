pointed<00:04:02.280> needles<00:04:03.280> we<00:04:03.459> can<00:04:03.610> go<00:04:03.760> right<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.360> left

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
pointed needles we can go right to left

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260 
pointed needles we can go right to left
so<00:04:04.870> what<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.740> want<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.040> do<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.580> kind<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.060> look

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
so what we want to do is kind of look

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.430 
so what we want to do is kind of look
under<00:04:07.630> this<00:04:07.780> cast<00:04:08.200> on<00:04:08.470> here<00:04:08.800> and<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.550> see

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
under this cast on here and you can see

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.280 
under this cast on here and you can see
the<00:04:11.440> stitches<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.010> first<00:04:12.459> row<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.870> stitches

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
the stitches the first row the stitches

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.440 
the stitches the first row the stitches
of<00:04:14.440> our<00:04:14.590> sock<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.910> want<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.150> pick

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450

those<00:04:16.720> up<00:04:17.040> going<00:04:18.040> across<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.989> we<00:04:19.989> want<00:04:20.200> up<00:04:20.290> the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
those up going across and we want up the

those up going across and we want up the
right<00:04:20.709> leg<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.790> each<00:04:22.060> one<00:04:22.360> on<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.600> front<00:04:22.750> of

right leg of each one on the front of
the<00:04:23.020> needles<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.830> stitches<00:04:24.130> will<00:04:24.490> be

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the needles so that the stitches will be

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.770 
the needles so that the stitches will be
mounted<00:04:25.210> properly<00:04:26.220> when<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.340> comes<00:04:27.720> time<00:04:28.720> to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
mounted properly when it comes time to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.230 
mounted properly when it comes time to
knit<00:04:29.200> them<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.340> we'll<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.700> work<00:04:30.910> our<00:04:31.090> way

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
knit them so we'll just work our way

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.340 
knit them so we'll just work our way
across<00:04:31.419> and<00:04:32.229> pick<00:04:32.860> up<00:04:33.070> every<00:04:34.030> stitch<00:04:34.390> now

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
across and pick up every stitch now

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.650 
across and pick up every stitch now
because<00:04:35.830> it's<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.400> provisional<00:04:36.970> cast<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.600> and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
because it's a provisional cast on and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.270 
because it's a provisional cast on and
we're<00:04:37.960> working<00:04:38.110> these<00:04:38.440> stitches<00:04:38.890> now<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
we're working these stitches now in the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.010 
we're working these stitches now in the
opposite<00:04:39.760> direction<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> they<00:04:40.450> are<00:04:40.540> put<00:04:40.810> on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
opposite direction that they are put on

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020 
opposite direction that they are put on
we're<00:04:41.740> only<00:04:41.919> gonna<00:04:42.070> be<00:04:42.160> able<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.400> pick<00:04:42.550> up<00:04:42.580> one

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
we're only gonna be able to pick up one

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.500 
we're only gonna be able to pick up one
fewer<00:04:43.570> stitch<00:04:44.050> then<00:04:44.590> we<00:04:44.740> put<00:04:45.040> on<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:46.000> keep<00:04:46.300> that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
fewer stitch then we put on so keep that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.440 
fewer stitch then we put on so keep that
in<00:04:46.690> mind<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.770> when<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.100> get<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.120> end<00:04:49.300> you

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
in mind and when you get to the end you

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.870 
in mind and when you get to the end you
need<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.600> actually<00:04:49.870> do<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.710> make<00:04:50.979> one<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.700> end

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
need to actually do it make one to end

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.790 
need to actually do it make one to end
up<00:04:52.060> with<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.419> same<00:04:52.660> number<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.990> stitches<00:04:53.290> and

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
up with the same number of stitches and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.370 
up with the same number of stitches and
that's<00:04:54.010> noted<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.610> pattern<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.140> can

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
that's noted in the pattern so you can

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.450 
that's noted in the pattern so you can
see<00:04:56.500> what<00:04:56.590> we're<00:04:56.740> doing<00:04:56.770> we're<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.040> going

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
see what we're doing we're just going

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.790 
see what we're doing we're just going
across<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.210> picking<00:04:58.570> up<00:04:58.660> up<00:04:58.960> all<00:04:59.500> the

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
across and just picking up up all the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.890 
across and just picking up up all the
way<00:04:59.950> across

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.180 

alright<00:05:08.900> I've<00:05:09.050> finished<00:05:09.349> picking<00:05:09.889> up<00:05:10.009> my

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
alright I've finished picking up my

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.550 
alright I've finished picking up my
stitches<00:05:10.819> right<00:05:11.389> underneath<00:05:12.020> the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
stitches right underneath the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.999 
stitches right underneath the
provisional<00:05:13.190> cast<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.819> and<00:05:14.690> so<00:05:15.259> now<00:05:15.470> we<00:05:15.530> get<00:05:15.889> to

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
provisional cast on and so now we get to

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.600 
provisional cast on and so now we get to
do<00:05:16.129> the<00:05:16.250> fun<00:05:16.460> part<00:05:17.349> so<00:05:18.349> this<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:19.009> where<00:05:19.280> we<00:05:19.430> did

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
do the fun part so this is where we did

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.460 
do the fun part so this is where we did
our<00:05:19.639> extra<00:05:20.360> chains<00:05:20.690> at<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.050> end<00:05:21.259> of<00:05:21.409> the

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
our extra chains at the end of the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.790 
our extra chains at the end of the
provisional<00:05:22.129> cast<00:05:22.460> on<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:24.020> we<00:05:24.110> want<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.379> take

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
provisional cast on so we want to take

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.360 
provisional cast on so we want to take
that<00:05:25.009> loop<00:05:25.449> back<00:05:26.449> out<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.020> we<00:05:27.139> put<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.560> there

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.140 

and<00:05:31.370> then<00:05:31.610> we<00:05:31.879> can<00:05:32.120> just<00:05:32.740> unravel<00:05:33.740> this<00:05:33.979> I

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.589 

didn't<00:05:41.169> okay<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.699> can<00:05:43.879> just<00:05:44.060> pull<00:05:44.330> that

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
didn't okay and you can just pull that

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:52.420 
didn't okay and you can just pull that
provisional<00:05:45.229> cast<00:05:45.590> on<00:05:46.330> right<00:05:47.330> now<00:05:47.569> I<00:05:51.430> grabbed

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
provisional cast on right now I grabbed

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.129 
provisional cast on right now I grabbed
it<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.699> couple<00:05:53.030> places<00:05:53.889> all<00:05:54.889> the<00:05:55.069> way<00:05:58.960> so<00:05:59.960> that

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
it a couple places all the way so that

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.320 
it a couple places all the way so that
wasn't<00:06:00.440> quite<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:00.949> fun<00:06:01.190> as<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.490> can<00:06:01.699> be<00:06:01.940> but

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
wasn't quite as fun as it can be but

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.320 
wasn't quite as fun as it can be but
anyway<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:02.900> get<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.229> idea<00:06:03.319> and<00:06:04.210> then<00:06:05.210> when

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
anyway you get the idea and then when

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.209 
anyway you get the idea and then when
you<00:06:05.419> get<00:06:05.569> to<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:05.900> end<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.500> can<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:06.800> cut<00:06:07.039> that

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
you get to the end you can just cut that

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.540 
you get to the end you can just cut that
out<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:08.690> there<00:06:08.930> now<00:06:09.199> you<00:06:09.259> have<00:06:09.650> live<00:06:10.159> stitches

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
out and there now you have live stitches

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.709 
out and there now you have live stitches
on<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.719> outside<00:06:11.750> of<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.380> needle<00:06:12.710> as<00:06:12.889> well<00:06:13.719> now

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:14.719 
on the outside of the needle as well now

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.510 
on the outside of the needle as well now
as<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:15.050> said<00:06:15.349> you're<00:06:15.919> only<00:06:16.039> gonna<00:06:16.250> be<00:06:16.340> able<00:06:16.460> to

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
as I said you're only gonna be able to

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.999 
as I said you're only gonna be able to
pick<00:06:16.669> up<00:06:16.789> one<00:06:17.029> fewer<00:06:17.389> stitch<00:06:17.900> then<00:06:18.349> you<00:06:18.469> put<00:06:18.710> on

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
pick up one fewer stitch then you put on

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.120 
pick up one fewer stitch then you put on
so<00:06:19.819> when<00:06:20.029> you<00:06:20.150> get<00:06:20.360> down<00:06:20.599> here<00:06:20.659> to<00:06:21.139> the<00:06:21.259> end<00:06:21.500> you

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
so when you get down here to the end you

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.550
