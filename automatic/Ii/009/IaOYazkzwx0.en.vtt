first<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.170> played<00:01:31.530> smash<00:01:31.710> run<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> few

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
first got it I played smash run a few

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
first got it I played smash run a few
times<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.400> week<00:01:32.430> mm-hmm<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> kept

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
times a week mm-hmm but then I kept

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
times a week mm-hmm but then I kept
playing<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.790> actually

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
playing it it got really good I actually

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
playing it it got really good I actually
got<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.420> excited<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.280> one

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
got really excited about it and it's one

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.920 
got really excited about it and it's one
of<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:38.850> things<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.509> not<00:01:39.540> think

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
of those things I just did not think

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
of those things I just did not think
that<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.229> gonna<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.890> ended<00:01:41.130> up

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that it was gonna like and I ended up

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.730 
that it was gonna like and I ended up
really<00:01:41.430> liking<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:43.020> other<00:01:43.049> thing<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really liking the other thing that I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
really liking the other thing that I
wasn't<00:01:44.430> sure<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> would<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> I'm

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
wasn't sure I would like and I'm

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.179 
wasn't sure I would like and I'm
starting<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> custom<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:46.890> sets

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
starting to like is the custom move sets

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
starting to like is the custom move sets
you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:48.000> earn<00:01:48.210> custom<00:01:48.689> move<00:01:48.810> sets<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you can earn custom move sets for

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
you can earn custom move sets for
characters<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.970> can

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
characters and in a way you can

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.609 
characters and in a way you can
completely<00:01:51.570> transform<00:01:51.869> characters<00:01:52.470> for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
completely transform characters for

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.170 
completely transform characters for
example<00:01:52.649> Lucas<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> game

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
example Lucas is not in this game

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.740 
example Lucas is not in this game
but<00:01:54.869> Lucas's<00:01:55.619> moves<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> game<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
but Lucas's moves are in the game like

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
but Lucas's moves are in the game like
PK<00:01:58.110> freeze<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.590> example<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.280> RPK<00:01:59.759> freeze

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
PK freeze for example you can RPK freeze

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.840 
PK freeze for example you can RPK freeze
and<00:02:00.299> change<00:02:00.570> your<00:02:00.869> change<00:02:01.619> neces<00:02:01.950> PK<00:02:02.250> flash<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and change your change neces PK flash to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.410 
and change your change neces PK flash to
PK<00:02:03.119> freeze

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
PK freeze

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.270 
PK freeze
you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.110> change<00:02:04.259> his<00:02:04.469> other<00:02:04.619> attacks<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.189> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you can change his other attacks and to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.649 
you can change his other attacks and to
basically<00:02:05.729> Lucas<00:02:06.180> attacks

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
basically Lucas attacks

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.020 
basically Lucas attacks
so<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.200> next<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.560> blonde<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.879> could

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so if next was blonde you could

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.729 
so if next was blonde you could
essentially<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.080> Lucas<00:02:10.379> straight<00:02:10.619> up

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
essentially just have Lucas straight up

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.780 
essentially just have Lucas straight up
in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> game<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
in the game and they do that for all the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.100 
in the game and they do that for all the
different<00:02:11.910> characters

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
different characters

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.840 
different characters
and<00:02:13.440> originally<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.040> wasn't<00:02:14.400> sold<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and originally I wasn't sold on that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.550 
and originally I wasn't sold on that
because<00:02:15.120> I'm<00:02:15.330> thinking<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.470> go

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
because I'm thinking you know if you go

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440 
because I'm thinking you know if you go
to<00:02:16.620> someone's<00:02:16.950> house<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.340> something<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.880> you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
to someone's house or something and you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.360 
to someone's house or something and you
have<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.630> play<00:02:18.900> default<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.250> don't

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
have to play default because you don't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.010 
have to play default because you don't
have<00:02:20.430> your<00:02:20.580> character<00:02:20.970> there<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.450> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> go

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
have your character there or if you go

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180 
have your character there or if you go
to<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> tournament<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:22.710> won't<00:02:22.890> allow<00:02:23.160> it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
to a tournament they won't allow it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.310 
to a tournament they won't allow it
there<00:02:23.550> but<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.570> probably<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:25.020> really<00:02:25.140> going

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
there but it's probably not really going

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.930 
there but it's probably not really going
to<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.500> an<00:02:25.590> issue<00:02:25.710> because<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.430> character<00:02:26.880> is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
to be an issue because your character is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.220 
to be an issue because your character is
gonna<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.720> 3ds<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.450> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
gonna be on the 3ds with you so it's you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.870 
gonna be on the 3ds with you so it's you
should<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.620> able<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.950> use<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.520> Matt<00:02:32.730> in

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
should be able to use it with Matt in

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.700 
should be able to use it with Matt in
matches<00:02:33.270> between<00:02:33.450> other<00:02:33.810> 3d<00:02:34.050> s's<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.530> if<00:02:34.620> you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
matches between other 3d s's and if you

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.260 
matches between other 3d s's and if you
go<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.860> someone<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> has<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.490> Wii<00:02:35.790> U<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.000> can

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
go to someone that has a Wii U you can

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.810 
go to someone that has a Wii U you can
transfer<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:38.070> should<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> balanced

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
transfer it so and it should be balanced

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.680 
transfer it so and it should be balanced
yeah<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.050> balanced<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
yeah I think it's balanced so if you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.030 
yeah I think it's balanced so if you
want<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> use<00:02:42.990> custom<00:02:43.350> loops<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.830> should

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
want to use custom loops that you should

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.010 
want to use custom loops that you should
and<00:02:44.400> I'm<00:02:44.850> trying<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> actually<00:02:45.450> play<00:02:45.990> around

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
and I'm trying to actually play around

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.470 
and I'm trying to actually play around
with<00:02:46.350> them<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.890> maybe<00:02:47.220> make<00:02:47.520> make<00:02:47.970> nests<00:02:48.210> more

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
with them and maybe make make nests more
