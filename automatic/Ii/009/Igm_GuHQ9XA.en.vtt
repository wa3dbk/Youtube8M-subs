00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.650 
someone to take out this plastic here ah
the<00:02:38.520> bottom<00:02:38.820> part<00:02:39.950> feels<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> mat<00:02:41.700> solar

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the bottom part feels like a mat solar

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.200 
the bottom part feels like a mat solar
material<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:44.070> stick<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> any

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
material that would stick I get to any

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.780 
material that would stick I get to any
surface<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.980> know<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.220> will<00:02:47.310> prevent<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
surface and you know it will prevent it

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120 
surface and you know it will prevent it
from<00:02:47.940> moving<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.950> where

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
from moving as you can see this is where

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.910 
from moving as you can see this is where
you<00:02:50.220> plug<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.820> lightning<00:02:51.660> connector<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
you plug in your lightning connector and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.600 
you plug in your lightning connector and
that's<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:54.050> simple<00:02:55.050> now<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.010> do<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that's it very simple now I do have a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.020 
that's it very simple now I do have a
bumper<00:02:57.240> case<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.690> my<00:02:57.870> iphone<00:02:58.110> 5<00:02:59.000> which<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
bumper case for my iphone 5 which is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.440 
bumper case for my iphone 5 which is
this<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.500> tried<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
this one here and I tried it with it but

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.360 
this one here and I tried it with it but
it<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.630> won't<00:03:04.050> charge<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.650> guess<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.190> doesn't

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it just won't charge I guess it doesn't

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.270 
it just won't charge I guess it doesn't
let<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> phone<00:03:06.000> go<00:03:06.300> all<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.500> way<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
let the phone go all the way down and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.400 
let the phone go all the way down and
obviously<00:03:08.760> here<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.840> about<00:03:10.140> two

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
obviously here this is about two

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640 
obviously here this is about two
millimeters<00:03:10.440> white<00:03:11.340> maybe<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.140> won't<00:03:13.440> work

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
millimeters white maybe so it won't work

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.150 
millimeters white maybe so it won't work
with<00:03:13.950> any<00:03:14.130> case<00:03:14.490> or<00:03:14.850> any<00:03:15.000> bumper<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:17.010> don't

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
with any case or any bumper you don't

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.360 
with any case or any bumper you don't
only<00:03:17.250> work<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:18.239> phone<00:03:18.510> itself<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.130> guys

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
only work the phone itself so you guys

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.229 
only work the phone itself so you guys
know<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.950> let's<00:03:22.950> plug<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.670> test<00:03:24.120> it

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
know so let's plug this in and test it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:35.620 
know so let's plug this in and test it
out

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.880 

so<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:36.810> goes<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.140> iphone<00:03:37.470> 5

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.120 

and<00:03:44.890> as<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.400> hear<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:46.090> charging<00:03:46.540> as<00:03:47.380> you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
and as you can hear it's charging as you

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.010 
and as you can hear it's charging as you
can<00:03:48.250> see<00:03:48.490> that<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.070> mentioned<00:03:51.100> before

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
can see that so as I mentioned before

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.620 
can see that so as I mentioned before
this<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> only<00:03:53.260> way<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.620> could<00:03:53.830> charge<00:03:54.130> it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
this is the only way you could charge it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.360 
this is the only way you could charge it
if<00:03:55.630> we<00:03:55.990> turn<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.590> foam<00:03:57.120> backwards<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.770> plug

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
if we turn the foam backwards and plug

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.950 
if we turn the foam backwards and plug
it<00:04:00.520> in<00:04:02.460> he<00:04:03.460> won't<00:04:03.760> charge<00:04:04.090> as<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.720> see

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
it in he won't charge as you can see

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.360 
it in he won't charge as you can see
here<00:04:05.370> we<00:04:06.370> turn<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:07.000> for<00:04:07.240> you<00:04:08.100> that's<00:04:09.100> not

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
here we turn this on for you that's not

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.650 
here we turn this on for you that's not
charging<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.740> only<00:04:11.890> way<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.910> charge<00:04:13.270> the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
charging so the only way to charge the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.530 
charging so the only way to charge the
phone<00:04:13.930> would<00:04:14.830> be<00:04:14.890> setting<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:17.530> way<00:04:18.540> as

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
phone would be setting it this way as

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.960 
phone would be setting it this way as
you<00:04:19.720> can<00:04:19.870> see<00:04:20.049> there<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.380> goes<00:04:20.640> so<00:04:21.640> now<00:04:21.790> it's

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
you can see there it goes so now it's

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.570 
you can see there it goes so now it's
