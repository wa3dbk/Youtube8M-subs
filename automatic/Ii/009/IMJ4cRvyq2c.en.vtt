00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 they are a kind of codes that are 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150
 located in the deepest part of our 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.189
 minds in the form of beliefs and everything 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.769
 kind of inhibitions that paralyze us 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.269
 account mariani costa that in a moment 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.540
 of his life he wrote in a paper of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.400
 parchment I'm a failure then what 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.920
 I sign with a drop of his blood and what 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
 buried a beautiful place in that place 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.779
 flower and began to design its reality 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 liberated from that curse is an act 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.130
 magic psycho where we get rid of those 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.740
 codes that we receive from our family 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 a contract is an agreement between two 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 parties that agree to give something already 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.910
 receive something in return but not all 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.640
 contracts are on paper not even 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 they are verbalized nor are they all 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 in the plane of consciousness 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
 even more so as in the case of the name there is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 contracts that we accept in inequality 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.390
 of conditions because they are sealed in the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 more tender childhood 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 the child intuits that the breach 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.590
 it implies not being loved what it means 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.750
 death our most primitive brain 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.510
 dictates the order to obey when the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 threat is to be kicked out of the clan these 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.210
 contracts can affect our 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.580
 four egos 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.040
 examples of intellectual contracts 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 many of the beliefs we have are 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 contracts that we maintain with our 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.430
 genealogical tree ideas that we have 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 transmitted from our great-grandparents and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 that we can not question 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.080
 get rid of any belief that does not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.000
 be beautiful and useful and you will be a lawyer like 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.920
 the men of benefit of this family 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 in trees where the artist is 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 considered as a starving man who 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.360
 he really does not know how to do anything he sees in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.550
 this house is spoken Christian not me 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 come out with wanting to study languages ​​point 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.149
 point points you just have to talk a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.030
 mother tongue 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.220
 if you are clumsy like your mother a prophecy 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.160
 that acts like a curse that ends 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.869
 fulfilling in life we ​​must leave 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.149
 things just as we have 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.539
 found a sign that the tree has 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.880
 stagnant and a child should never overcome 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.340
 a father an absolute madness that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.500
 connects with the neurosis of failure the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.659
 intellectual contracts are like 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.690
 irrational ideas that albert describes 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.769
 ellis roots of our emotions 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.270
 disturbed and behaviors 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.790
 mismatched 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 the psychogenealogy connects with its famous 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.620
 and in many cases effective therapy network 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.240
 emotive rational in the sense that the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.610
 family configures a scheme of 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.500
 toxic beliefs that we adopt 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.540
 out of loyalty to her and that move in 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.050
 four fundamental axes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.330
 If you do not have what you need, you die 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.700
 if my boyfriend leaves me I'll die the inheritance 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.780
 toxic is to confuse the need with the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.570
 wish 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.000
 If you do not have food, you die but if 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.940
 You want your boyfriend and you do not follow 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.460
 living this is horrible is horrible 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.530
 you have to cancel my vacation 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.200
 judge in excess there is nothing 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.690
 categorically bad, there are facts 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
 that cause us more or less pain if 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.740
 we order the painful events from 0 to 10 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.140
 and in the 10 we put the death of a being 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.440
 dear, how will we value canceling a 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.260
 I can not stand the holidays I can not stand the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.900
 loneliness there are situations that kill are 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.670
 unbearable to believe that something is the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.160
 boundary between life and death we 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.620
 makes us feel agonizing every time 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 that happens that leads to prefer a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.700
 disaster of love relationship 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.519
 loneliness is prohibited by the tree 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.260
 because it is approaching death if 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.019
 something bad happens is that there is a culprit 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.209
 and the family has to be condemned 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.220
 teaches to judge and look for guilty in 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.080
 those who download the responsibility of 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.379
 what happens or blame us 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.959
 the events themselves are not a 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.720
 confluence of factors nothing has a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.329
 only cause if we feel guilty of 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.060
 something the best medicine is a formula 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.799
 with three elements the acceptance the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.180
 repair and learning what 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.450
 happened to avoid as much as possible 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.730
 repeat the same mistake in the future 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.379
 examples of emotional contracts are usually 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.140
 come in inhibitions format 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.069
 emotional very associated with the levels 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.019
 of child consciousness to not grow up if 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.810
 he gets older one day he will abandon his 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.970
 parents is order will keep it with a 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.430
 emotional age of 10 years for the rest 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.650
 of his life see here we are from Madrid 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.109
 from the first month of life the child is 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.419
 club member when he grows up he does not have 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.970
 alternative if you do not like football or 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.740
 he is not Real Madrid will be considered a 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.930
 traitor or a sick 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.479
 do not be silly and do not become a girlfriend 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.090
 stay with mother she does not 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.880
 will disappoint and the couple is for all 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.650
 life nobody has ever divorced in 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.199
 our family we are all very 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.479
 Catholics the emotional contracts we 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.490
 bind the past with force and encourage 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.039
 dependency- based relationships 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.900
 emotional dissolve these contracts is 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.139
 finally open the door to the freedom of 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.060
 love with a higher level of consciousness 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.400
 examples of libidinal contracts here 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.250
 are all the creative inhibitions and 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.830
 sexual and theater painting 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.960
 music are a waste of time it's like 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 say that you should not devote yourself to things that 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.509
 they are not out of this relationship is not 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.599
 it suits you we could ask 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.599
 who does not really suit you if you 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.849
 you will marry at 25 and at 26 you will arrive 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.919
 the only daughter this could be a 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.800
 unconscious contract that is repeated from 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.319
 generation in generation a project that 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.659
 the tree has for us and the woman 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.639
 that expresses sexual desire is a whore 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.960
 towards the sex of the woman is just a 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.120
 procreation instrument 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.550
 to enjoy with his libidinal energy and to 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.410
 dessert of creation and of life 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.780
 prohibition of homosexuality and 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.849
 sexual practices that do not exist in the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 tree repertoire are also 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.210
 contracts that by defaulting on us 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.639
 they block the libido or we feel 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.039
 guilty and deserving of punishment if 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.900
 we left the sherd examples of 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.599
 material material contracts 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.000
 economic economic inhibitions 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.009
 it is necessary that we find the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.319
 elements that allow us to separate ourselves from the 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.620
 violence of fear and guilt 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.720
 or you are identical to your grandfather and with it 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.419
 one of the lineages takes possession of 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.000
 son see do not touch the buttons that the 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.849
 you will break when they do not let you touch anything 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.430
 it's because you do not have space if the money 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.620
 it is sin if they make us believe that the 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.650
 money is dirty will generate us a lot 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.750
 guilt to win it from him who risks 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.729
 loses more is worth bird in hand than 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.880
 hundred flying better bad is known 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.289
 what good to know point out of the 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.090
 territory is a disloyalty 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.310
 unforgivable and we have a fear 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.540
 ancestral to not be admitted again in 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.030
 the clan 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.080
 this urges to settle with a couple that 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.900
 it does not contribute anything 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.270
 an unsatisfactory job a house that 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.510
 it is not a home and also a city a 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.040
 bank a group of friends and so on 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.290
 installed in a territory forever 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.600
 because they have taught us to take risks 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.940
 is to lose everything instead of pushing 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.550
 those to follow our wishes as wise 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.740
 path of transformation the contracts 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.560
 they are fulfilled out of loyalty but also by 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.900
 fear of consequences let's say that 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.290
 there is a fear of being punished that is 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.170
 fulfill those predictions curses if 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.290
 you divorce you will look bad if you do 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.300
 artist you will live in poverty an act 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.980
 psycho magic to heal this kind of 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.400
 fear of non-compliance to what 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.560
 parents ordered would consist of performing 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.900
 metaphorically the prediction 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.370
 staging I overtook them 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.650
 Alejandro Jodorowsky tells us in his 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.360
 ten recipes to be happy there is no 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.910
 bigger relief than to start doing 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.820
 what we are really from the 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.890
 childhood impose on us other people's destinies 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.870
 convenient to remember that we are not in 

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.689
 the world to realize the dreams of 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.830
 our parents 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:47.830
 but their own
