00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I'm not very good at knowing what's in

wrong I mean frankly you have to get a
wrong<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.800> certain<00:00:29.279> amount<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.610> time<00:00:29.940> um<00:00:30.270> in

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
wrong a certain amount of time um in

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.819 
wrong a certain amount of time um in
order<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> sort<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> develop<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:33.200> mean<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.470> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
order to sort of develop I mean if you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
order to sort of develop I mean if you
don't<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.370> wrong<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
don't get it wrong it is just I think it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:52.060 
don't get it wrong it is just I think it
doesn't<00:00:37.350> become<00:00:37.649> incredibly<00:00:38.310> boring<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.920 

design<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.579> own<00:00:53.640> things<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> I'll

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
design all of my own things and I'll

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
design all of my own things and I'll
just<00:00:55.469> alter<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.950> by<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
just alter them by kind of like a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
just alter them by kind of like a
millimeter<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.870> I'll<00:00:58.079> add<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> button

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
millimeter or two or I'll add a button

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
millimeter or two or I'll add a button
or<00:00:58.950> I'll<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> off<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.940> everything's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
or I'll take it off and everything's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
or I'll take it off and everything's
kind<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> morphs<00:01:02.340> into

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
kind of like kind of morphs into

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.690 
kind of like kind of morphs into
something<00:01:02.789> else<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:04.350> used<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.219> tennis

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
something else these used to be tennis

bracelets I'm now doing earrings the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
bracelets I'm now doing earrings the
other<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.030> quite<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.600> some

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I collect rocks and a rock crystal and I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
I collect rocks and a rock crystal and I
love<00:01:20.759> Jade<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:22.080> sorts<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> different

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.139 
metals and I know this is gonna sound
very<00:01:25.110> mad<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.159> also<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
very mad but but also I have a

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.929 
very mad but but also I have a
fascination<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.930> physics<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> images

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
fascination with physics and the images

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
fascination with physics and the images
are<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.330> from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> Hubble<00:01:30.930> telescope<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.729> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
are up from the Hubble telescope I just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
are up from the Hubble telescope I just
faced<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> strangely<00:01:33.720> enough<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> take

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
faced and strangely enough if you take

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.940 
faced and strangely enough if you take
the<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.280> smallest<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> visual

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the very smallest things and the visual

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
the very smallest things and the visual
largest<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.729> kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> look<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
largest and you can kind of look at the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
largest and you can kind of look at the
world<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> molecular<00:01:40.289> level<00:01:40.619> they're<00:01:41.159> very

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
world at a molecular level they're very

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.080 
world at a molecular level they're very
very<00:01:41.520> similar<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.270> mean<00:01:42.869> let<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:44.090> through

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
very similar I mean let you see through

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
very similar I mean let you see through
all<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> extraordinary<00:01:46.830> colors

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
all these kind of extraordinary colors

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.920 
all these kind of extraordinary colors
and<00:01:47.789> then<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.600> find<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.050> crystals

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.900 

I<00:01:53.990> always<00:01:54.740> wanted<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.040> be<00:01:55.220> part<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:55.730> the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
I always wanted to be part of the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.120 
I always wanted to be part of the
knights<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> round<00:01:56.870> table<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.740> was<00:01:57.830> really

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
knights of the round table it was really

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.920 
knights of the round table it was really
to<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.370> with<00:01:58.400> literature<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.300> anything<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.780> was

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
to do with literature so anything I was

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.960 
to do with literature so anything I was
reading<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.560> read<00:02:01.130> sort<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.400> trying<00:02:01.670> back<00:02:01.880> on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.950 

I<00:02:07.000> was<00:02:07.930> standing<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.310> corner<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.970> usual

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
I was standing in the corner as usual

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.490 
I was standing in the corner as usual
with<00:02:11.230> Lee<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.920> Sean<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.080> said<00:02:14.230> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
with Lee and Sean and I just said that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.440 
with Lee and Sean and I just said that
wouldn't<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.280> great<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.550> be<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:16.060> as

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
wouldn't be just so great to be just as

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.880 
wouldn't be just so great to be just as
completely<00:02:17.190> armor-plated<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.880> more<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.450> a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
completely armor-plated it's more of a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.100 
completely armor-plated it's more of a
statement<00:02:20.890> about<00:02:21.660> protection<00:02:22.660> against<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
statement about protection against the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.750 
statement about protection against the
world<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.530> how<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.550> most

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
world and how to do that and the most

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.170

beautiful<00:02:25.150> form<00:02:25.540> possible<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:28.300> slowly

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
beautiful form possible and I'm slowly

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.180 
beautiful form possible and I'm slowly
but<00:02:31.180> gradually<00:02:32.040> working<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:35.010> over<00:02:36.010> my

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
but gradually working my way over my

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.290 
but gradually working my way over my
body<00:02:36.460> or<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.900> sort<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.950> get<00:02:39.280> each<00:02:39.550> part<00:02:39.940> sort

body or just sort of get each part sort

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.530 

the<00:02:49.010> idea<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.880> eccentric<00:02:50.240> because

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the idea that one is eccentric because

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.020 
the idea that one is eccentric because
of<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:51.020> one<00:02:51.800> puts<00:02:52.070> herself<00:02:52.190> together<00:02:52.790> is

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
of the way one puts herself together is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.340 
of the way one puts herself together is
that<00:02:53.210> just<00:02:53.420> that's<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.810> doesn't<00:02:54.230> make<00:02:54.290> any

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
that just that's just doesn't make any

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.740 
that just that's just doesn't make any
sense<00:02:54.680> at<00:02:54.920> all<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.400> said<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.180> think<00:02:56.510> probably

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
sense at all I said I think probably

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.900 
sense at all I said I think probably
avant-garde<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.560> more<00:02:57.800> appropriate

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.330 

I<00:03:05.940> work<00:03:06.930> very<00:03:06.960> closely<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.950> artists

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I work very closely with the artists

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
I work very closely with the artists
that<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.490> work<00:03:08.820> with<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.510> we<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.990> collaborate

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
that I work with and we I collaborate

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.610 
that I work with and we I collaborate
very<00:03:10.770> closely<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.610> them<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.620> mean

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
very closely with them and I mean

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.830 
very closely with them and I mean
they're<00:03:14.040> my<00:03:14.220> family<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.600> part

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
they're my family and I like to be part

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660 
they're my family and I like to be part
of<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.080> process<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.070> important

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
of the process that's really important

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:27.410 
of the process that's really important
to<00:03:17.820> me<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:25.160> know<00:03:26.160> what<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:26.970> wish<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:27.180> all

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
to me you know what one can wish for all

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.230 
to me you know what one can wish for all
sorts<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.840> things<00:03:27.990> but<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.740> wish<00:03:29.580> no<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.210> I

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
sorts of things but I I wish no what I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.230 
sorts of things but I I wish no what I
hope<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.470> stop<00:03:31.890> looking

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
hope for is that we stop looking

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.280 
hope for is that we stop looking
backwards<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:33.390> then<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:33.750> stop<00:03:34.020> sort<00:03:34.230> of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
backwards and then we stop sort of

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.920 
backwards and then we stop sort of
recycling<00:03:35.130> all<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:36.090> looks<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.390> we've<00:03:36.570> been

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
recycling all the looks that we've been

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.230 
recycling all the looks that we've been
going<00:03:37.110> through<00:03:37.320> for<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.770> last<00:03:37.950> 20<00:03:38.430> years<00:03:38.460> and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
going through for the last 20 years and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.850 
going through for the last 20 years and
people<00:03:39.510> start<00:03:39.780> looking<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.260> actually<00:03:40.530> start

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
people start looking they actually start

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.610 
people start looking they actually start
moving<00:03:41.520> forwards<00:03:42.360> again<00:03:42.630> like<00:03:42.990> they<00:03:43.140> used<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
moving forwards again like they used to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.890 
moving forwards again like they used to
that's<00:03:44.040> why<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.670> was<00:03:44.850> really<00:03:45.360> important<00:03:45.870> for

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that's why it was really important for

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's why it was really important for
me<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.790> fighting<00:03:47.790> because<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.330> just

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
me to do the fighting because I just

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.500 
me to do the fighting because I just
thought<00:03:48.960> I<00:03:49.260> want<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.790> students<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.300> be<00:03:51.390> able

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
thought I want the students to be able

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.840 
thought I want the students to be able
to<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.900> how<00:03:52.080> things<00:03:52.380> were<00:03:52.650> made<00:03:52.890> or<00:03:53.280> are<00:03:53.340> made

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
to see how things were made or are made

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.870 
to see how things were made or are made
or<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.630> made<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:56.310> good<00:03:56.520> is<00:03:56.670> it's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
or can be made because what good is it's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.730 
or can be made because what good is it's
just<00:03:57.360> sitting<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.660> my<00:03:57.690> closet<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.560> they're
