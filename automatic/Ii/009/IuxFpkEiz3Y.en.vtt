takes<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> hassle<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
takes all that hassle out of it and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
takes all that hassle out of it and
there's<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.960> many<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.320> bits<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
there's so many more bits in this and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.359 
there's so many more bits in this and
there<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.689> flapjack<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.189> that's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
there would be in a flapjack and that's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.959 
there would be in a flapjack and that's
as<00:01:53.520> well<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> final<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.700> small

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
as well and the final bit is a small

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.160 
as well and the final bit is a small
knob<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.240> butter<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.719> reach<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.049> through

knob of butter and reach on through

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 
knob of butter and reach on through
there<00:01:58.469> yep<00:01:58.740> melted<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> go<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
there yep melted that's going to go in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.660 
there yep melted that's going to go in
there<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.479> 40<00:02:00.840> grams<00:02:01.219> okay<00:02:02.250> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there it's about 40 grams okay just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.899 
there it's about 40 grams okay just
