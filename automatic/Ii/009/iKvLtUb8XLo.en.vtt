touching some metal before you touch
anything<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.560> let<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.590> guided

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
anything like this so let that guided

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.750 
anything like this so let that guided
hold<00:02:31.769> exactly<00:02:31.920> guys<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.250> micro<00:02:35.640> ATX

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
hold exactly guys so this is a micro ATX

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.000 
hold exactly guys so this is a micro ATX
motherboard<00:02:36.510> hence<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.019> small<00:02:37.140> size<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
motherboard hence the small size and the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.520 
motherboard hence the small size and the
limited<00:02:38.370> amount<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.670> connectors<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.410> your
