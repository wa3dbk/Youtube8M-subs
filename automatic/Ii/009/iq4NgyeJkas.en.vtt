00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.420
 what is important in the cut is 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 thinking and let's see 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.580

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.030
 little bit 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.810

 there are as many materials as for example 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:43.390
 in which fiber was painted that is very
