probably my all-time favorite I mean it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.800 
probably my all-time favorite I mean it
just<00:00:23.609> there's<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> lot<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.570> do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
just there's a lot of things you can do

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
just there's a lot of things you can do
with<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> widget<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> pretty<00:00:26.939> nice<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
with it in the widget is pretty nice to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
with it in the widget is pretty nice to
have<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> full<00:00:27.689> screen<00:00:27.960> widget<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.820> lot

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
have a full screen widget to have a lot

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
have a full screen widget to have a lot
of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> widgets<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:31.040> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> different<00:00:32.189> kind

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
of the widgets a lot of different kind

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.729 
of the widgets a lot of different kind
of<00:00:32.790> size<00:00:32.940> widgets<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.079> think<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
of size widgets but I think this is the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
of size widgets but I think this is the
best<00:00:34.950> music<00:00:35.340> player<00:00:35.550> overall<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.989> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
best music player overall because it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.819 
best music player overall because it
actually<00:00:37.640> makes<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.090> sound<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.719> dynamic<00:00:40.320> if

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
actually makes the sound more dynamic if

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually makes the sound more dynamic if
that<00:00:41.399> makes<00:00:41.610> any<00:00:41.730> sense<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.629> mean

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that makes any sense you know I mean

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020 
that makes any sense you know I mean
like<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.530> most<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.070> especially<00:00:44.489> android

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
like on most of these especially android

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.720 
like on most of these especially android
phones<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.450> lot<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.070> lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> sound<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
phones a lot of a lot of the sound the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
phones a lot of a lot of the sound the
output<00:00:48.239> isn't<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.719> great<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
output isn't that great you know like on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
output isn't that great you know like on
the<00:00:49.920> stock<00:00:50.190> players<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.239> think

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the stock players but I actually think

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.529 
the stock players but I actually think
and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> fact<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:54.090> music

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and I know for the fact that this music

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.260 
and I know for the fact that this music
player<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:55.199> makes<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:56.010> your<00:00:56.640> music

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
player actually makes your your music

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
player actually makes your your music
sound<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> lot<00:00:57.750> better<00:00:57.809> especially<00:00:58.350> through

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
sound a lot better especially through

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.459 
sound a lot better especially through
headphones<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.989> definitely<00:01:01.020> suggest

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
headphones so I would definitely suggest

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
headphones so I would definitely suggest
getting<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.190> application<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> lot

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
getting this application there's a lot

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
getting this application there's a lot
of<00:01:03.300> things<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of things you can do in here when you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.410 
but i will say especially on samsung
phones<00:03:56.920> because<00:03:57.070> i<00:03:57.190> had<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.580> epic<00:03:57.820> actually

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
phones because i had the epic actually

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.840 
phones because i had the epic actually
before<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.200> it<00:04:00.010> were<00:04:00.190> great<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.550> there

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
before this and it were great on there

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.610 
before this and it were great on there
it's<00:04:01.060> going<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.300> work<00:04:01.450> good<00:04:01.690> on<00:04:01.720> any<00:04:01.989> phone<00:04:02.290> but

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
it's going to work good on any phone but

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.410 
it's going to work good on any phone but
i<00:04:02.650> think<00:04:03.010> more<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.459> samsung<00:04:04.150> phones

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
i think more so on samsung phones

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.030 
i think more so on samsung phones
because<00:04:04.690> just<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.440> way<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.650> they're<00:04:05.829> made

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
because just the way that they're made

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.640 
because just the way that they're made
their<00:04:06.670> closer<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:08.100> ipods<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.400> I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
their closer to ipods and I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.860 
their closer to ipods and I
phones<00:04:09.799> than<00:04:10.040> any<00:04:10.220> other<00:04:10.400> phone<00:04:10.700> out<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:11.269> you
