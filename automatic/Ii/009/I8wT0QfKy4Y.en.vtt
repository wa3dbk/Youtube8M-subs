the first game I have picked up I
decided<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.390> deluxe<00:00:39.390> edition<00:00:39.629> just

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
decided to get the deluxe edition just

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
decided to get the deluxe edition just
with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> fact<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.219> hard<00:00:41.520> they're<00:00:41.700> saying

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the game is uh I thought the strategy

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.510 
the game is uh I thought the strategy
got<00:00:45.960> included<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:47.070> probably<00:00:47.399> come

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
got included would would probably come

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.500 
got included would would probably come

it<00:00:51.690> fairly<00:00:52.379> addicting<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.070> far<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it fairly addicting so far it is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
it fairly addicting so far it is
difficult<00:00:55.770> though<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> can't<00:00:56.760> say<00:00:56.969> i've

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
difficult though I can't say i've

included<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.360> soundtrack<00:03:24.360> with<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
included a soundtrack with the the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.289

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
give it a listen to either but my guess

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.539 
give it a listen to either but my guess
is<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.360> probably<00:03:30.570> pretty<00:03:31.200> cool<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.310> yeah

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
is it's probably pretty cool the yeah

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.440 
is it's probably pretty cool the yeah
the<00:03:33.000> music<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:34.590> sets<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.360> mood<00:03:36.360> of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
