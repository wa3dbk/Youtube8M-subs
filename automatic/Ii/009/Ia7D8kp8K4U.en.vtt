00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
about it and I was like it costs a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.090 
about it and I was like it costs a
little<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.670> than<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.300> freakin<00:00:39.890> 1600<00:00:40.890> card

time<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.090> had<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> store<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> time

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
time they had in the store at the time

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
time they had in the store at the time

- I think only to do exchange and play

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.480 
- I think only to do exchange and play
in<00:01:10.110> trade<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.590> exchange<00:01:10.980> has<00:01:11.190> far<00:01:11.460> greater

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
in trade but exchange has far greater

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.980 
in trade but exchange has far greater
selection<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:13.880> yeah<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.910> thought<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.870> know
