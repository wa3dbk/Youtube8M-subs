00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
not that expensive let's see how long

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.109 
not that expensive let's see how long
that<00:01:07.229> lasts

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
it's okay if you have this long not a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's okay if you have this long not a
problem<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.900> there<00:01:44.170> are<00:01:44.260> four<00:01:44.590> screws<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.760> of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
problem so there are four screws all of

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.150 
problem so there are four screws all of
them<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.180> ate<00:01:46.300> milder<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.070> the

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
them I ate milder so if this is the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.690

headlight as you can see first one is
right<00:01:51.880> here<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:54.250> not<00:01:54.310> focusing<00:01:54.850> very<00:01:55.180> well

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
right here it's not focusing very well

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090 
right here it's not focusing very well
second<00:01:57.070> one<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.220> right<00:01:57.490> here<00:01:58.320> third<00:01:59.320> one<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.770> if

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
second one is right here third one is if

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.380
