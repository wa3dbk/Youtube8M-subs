00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.630
 at manufacturer of regulatory office and me 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.250
 finally got the samsung galaxy 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.099
 note 8 in the fingers 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 so to speak the middle representative of the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.220
 not family 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 two years ago , he gave the note to samsung 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 1 presented then last year came 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
 no 10.1 and now probably the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480
 medium-sized tablets and a bit in the trend 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.609
 and now with the Samsung Galaxy Note 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 8.0 in the middle and all 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 honest i am pleasantly surprised i 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.090
 was expecting worse because you were 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 know it maybe I'm so the fan 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 from plastic and this time yes plastic 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 again at the not 8.0 that is then 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.710
 Slippery again and so on 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 but actually it is here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.489
 easy and so does not bother it is that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.840
 you have to clearly say fingerprint 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.940
 vulnerable but that bothers me now 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.200
 relatively little that the camera is here 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.579
 a bit out of the stands so you can see 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 that kind of bothers me too 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.079
 not really because of the cameras 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.610
 I'll tell who with a tray 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.140
 She takes a pretty silly picture 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.850
 Of course you can do that on the table 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.379
 is then the danger is relatively large 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 that through this slightly protruding 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 I do not want to pass the camera 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.320
 exclude but do not bother me 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.850
 and otherwise it is really one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.570
 easy strong is albert I would have like that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 not expected 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 I did not care about anything 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 samsung was expected to have one 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 bit criticized for being in 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 the galaxy note 8.0 only has one display 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.759
 with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 many have often built themselves 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.119
 full of hd or something else completely 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 honestly it only bothers me when I'm so upset 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.079
 50 to 70 centimeters on this display 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 Everything looks sharp need more 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.420
 not me 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.560
 So I would not as a point of criticism 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.630
 tackle under the hood 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.310
 is now also runs louder good 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.320
 here the samsung roadshow under the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.759
 hood beats the Samsung quad core with 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.560
 1.6 gigahertz per core 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.079
 there you have android 4.1 point 2 on it 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.030
 of course, the whole covered with 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.530
 samsung touchwiz or resp 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.720
 natureworks us this surface so 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.369
 I like it here actually good I 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.780
 I have a problem with Android at the moment 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.970
 usually on tablet has the next one 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.439
 scene and there bothers me vanilla android 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.450
 on it because it just fell to me a few 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.039
 It is not functional 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.810
 user-friendly and above all these 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.610
 Doppels the films here there is one 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.780
 Just couple me at android 4.2 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.310
 missing on the mac system 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.530
 Here you have now the start surface 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.090
 which one also knows of only 2 one knows 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.610
 maybe just raised to that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.870
 not 8.0 of course you can do it too 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.940
 use horizontally 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.290
 then I used such a horizontally 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.360
 the tablet that bothers me too 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.549
 not that it's even pretty cool and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.870
 is it also consistent that somewhere 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:34.599
 my brain smartphone user surface on 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.519
 a tray because that's not 8.0 you see 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.200
 her up the satire only earpiece and 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.459
 down here below is right here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.030
 I can try that 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.739
 capture 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.570
 right here next to this little one 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.609
 point this is a microphone has me here 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.049
 Two speakers and I can do that 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.100
 actually received a reprimand with 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.900
 phoning so that's theoretical 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.680
 also an oversized smartphone too 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.300
 in fact if at least 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.220
 used user with a bluetooth 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.360
 headphones or something but i could do it 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.180
 also used as a smartphone and there is 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.379
 the surface actually makes sense 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.540
 take a closer look 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.190
 that here this black point to her 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.599
 See this is one 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.069
 infrared interface that is when 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.930
 For example, I am so user of 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.280
 TV then I have it on top 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.019
 an infrared interface with the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.120
 matching samsung software i can 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.739
 set that so that then the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.970
 Serving TV is cool thing 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.700
 This will save me the search 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.739
 After the mobile first then I have 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.870
 here the loudly quiet rocker on it 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.310
 about the power button I have 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.150
 a second microphone on top 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.400
 I have a 3.5 millimeter 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.140
 jack input that means he can 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.500
 I then headphones and co afterwards 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 headset on his side is nothing 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.680
 not quite 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.910
 you have a micro sd slot here 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.890
 means here could be the device then too 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.540
 still expanding 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.310
 64 gb is not a problem that means me 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.829
 does not have to be extra special 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.489
 prices pay for larger ones 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.140
 storage capacity that is very fine 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.190
 then I have one more here 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.049
 second terminal that is the sense 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.910
 connection is so the 3g variant is 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.470
 there is also without them in connection then 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.060
 Of course, this connection will be missing 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.859
 then I have a choice without that though 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.430
 I already had the 3g version under it 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.019
 you show the headphones 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.849
 the great feature of the samsung galaxy 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.950
 note 8 0 is of course like the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.390
 entire not row the sp hidden 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.909
 down below and that is in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.829
 compared to the galaxy note 2 a bit 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.689
 flattened a bit rounded 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.250
 just a down here really 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.900
 Corner fits nicely and that pleases 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.699
 I did not solve it well so I liked that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.840
 sp anyway anyway if you want him then 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.789
 this is another matter in the end 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.289
 but it fits in quite well and me 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.490
 Now, of course, the entire menu 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.840
 serve it and also all this 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.889
 it new features second that 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.150
 everything works fine the fast 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.789
 category under the hood of has 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.320
 of course, neat steam under the 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.880
 hood is two gigabyte ram that is it 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.740
 everything is running smoothly anyway so I am 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.560
 always really surprised how good that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.660
 we do not work everything that way 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.009
 is good and I will find it again 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.750
 too bad I had said the resolution 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.240
 I think that's okay, but it's not 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.610
 amoled and who the samsung galaxy tab 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.110
 7.7 knows that knows that poverty on the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.030
 Templeton is very cool thing 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.229
 Here you have only one lcd if I have one 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.789
 now look at it from the side 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.440
 then you see the viewing angle of 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.150
 is not so cool I have from the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.699
 brightness but the viewing angle 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.620
 you sow that is then relatively bad 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.580
 I find that a pity solved 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.530
 camera , it can be synonymous still short 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.240
 look at 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.389
 it solves here I believe with 5 megapixels 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.400
 But on nails not on me tight 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.560
 and not quite as fast as 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.490
 You do not have this one very much 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.370
 but make enough as I said 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.570
 Cameras and tablets I'll stick with it 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.889
 that's a thing you can do about it 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.020
 anyway 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.909
 the first impression of the galaxy note 8.0 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.400
 better than expected so I would have 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.050
 actually worse expected to 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.849
 To be honest I find the resolution 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.259
 ok it is as sharp if I'm not there 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.479
 with the nasa in the display need it is 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.630
 wonderful the back of the plastic 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.729
 bothers me amazingly little here it is 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.020
 easy it is not slippery, of course 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.630
 little oxygen then slips 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.770
 but other tablets do the same and 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.570
 it will not be cheap it actually is 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.680
 just beautiful, slim and pleasant 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.430
 easy and allowed on the tablet 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.229
 nice thing 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.000
 I would say I want to 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.220
 even to fit across the trouser pocket 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.539
 who can not but too high and so 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.009
 is it a tablet what i mean 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.139
 can and even be productive these 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.580
 infrared interface fine thing so 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.390
 others from the samsung galaxy note 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.950
 Attention only fine thing 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.300
 the full review comes 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.520
 hopefully in the next few weeks 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.090
 the blog and otherwise read the daytime 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.090
 together
