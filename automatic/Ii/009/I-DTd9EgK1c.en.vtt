00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you're saying that's a different do it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.479 
you're saying that's a different do it
is<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.170> yeah<00:00:58.500> he<00:00:59.070> didn't<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> lot

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is I think so yeah he didn't have a lot

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.849 
is I think so yeah he didn't have a lot
of<00:00:59.550> different<00:00:59.910> pronunciations<00:01:00.629> though

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
of different pronunciations though

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.740 
of different pronunciations though
that's<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:02.070> mistake<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:03.000> dunno<00:01:03.480> -<00:01:03.510> we're

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's my mistake I dunno - we're

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.800 
that's my mistake I dunno - we're
tearing<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> rebuilding

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
tearing this thing down and rebuilding

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
tearing this thing down and rebuilding
it<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> realize<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.400> can't<00:01:08.670> win

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it because I realize that we can't win

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.960 
it because I realize that we can't win
with<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.810> constructed<00:01:10.740> before

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970
