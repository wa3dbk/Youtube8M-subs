 start grid and everything is ready for the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.640

 mitsubishi lancer junior high school 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.370
 pole position of this first race is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.380
 here concentrated quietly what is the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 strategy that you intend to use to 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.090
 This first good test first tries 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 drop well to make the first corner 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.380
 there in the first place and in printing a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.720
 strong pace from the start 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.580
 I only get some advantage 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.430
 distanced from the second placed 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.260
 five minutes here at the racetrack on the grid 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.380
 of departure and bruno mosque is 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 dropping in second place is 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.620
 concentrated just turned on the car and then 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.410
 Bruno is on top of the head this time. 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.170
 with the strategy the strategy is 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.989
 calm this moment and be five minutes 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.930
 here we try also quiet 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.290
 concentrate already thinking about the first curve 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.230
 of the mitsubishi lancer field race and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.330
 all cars are identical and put 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.510
 people make all the difference to the good 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.050
 result which makes the races still 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.050
 more exciting 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.870
 every step of the mitsubishi lancer campuses 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.480
 mitsubishi motors brings an average of 20 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.000
 mechanics who stand here waiting for the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.730
 cars to give all the assistance and 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.770
 pilots only have a job putting the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.000
 Put on your helmet and go to 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.000
 speed track 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.060
 the cars are arriving the first 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.580
 and we have the most 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.530
 once elias junior left on pole 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.350
 position came first and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.210
 Now reverse grid eighth place 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.740
 challenge increases even more 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.900
 now more complicated I do not come more than 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.300
 behind another other type of strategy 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.550
 Let's go and let's try to do it. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.040
 the best with the island was good I could not 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.420
 follow the elisa x 2 errinhos and there 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.110
 then could not fetch but was 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.450
 very good 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.510
 Thinking about the great championship I'm happy. 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.060
 It was a good race, it's now the next one. 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.790
 battery reverses the grid 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.910
 Let's see, I want to get one more time. 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.910
 the victory 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.550
 This is a very special space here. 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.370
 of the racetrack complex by the Titan is a 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.800
 lounge where guests can watch 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.780
 the race and up here they have a 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.360
 super track view 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.180
 Wow, it's very beautiful, you can see it all. 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.000
 every circuit loses nothing in this 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.550
 his niece if this racetrack is here 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.860
 very cool plus a lot of celina 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.810
 organized and this opportunity and she 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.730
 I was trying superansiosa to watch the father 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.550
 I did not sleep with him yesterday or anything. 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.320
 pure emotion and anxiety and I think super 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.210
 cool because of the structure they have to 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.340
 to be able to receive the family 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.940
 the steering wheel is the newest racetrack 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.030
 recognized by CB and follows 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.680
 the standards of reliability among competitors 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.460
 it is known as a locked circuit 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.280
 and quite technical full of climbs and 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.710
 down so it is already considered 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.710
 one of the best racetracks in brazil 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.790
 this is top there is no racetrack 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.470
 with this quality of asphalt with this 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.210
 security is very difficult to find in the 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.900
 Brazil very difficult even this 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.880
 proximity of the public to the cars 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.800
 Racing is very cool, everybody. 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.900
 like many cars are here if the 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.610
 public is very near summer that in 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.800
 everything is happening as the 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.840
 pilots prepare to exit the cars 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.830
 so this is all very cool in this 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.830
 racetrack really 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.690
 Catholic is phenomenal and the clue I 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.910
 like a lot because it has downhill climb is 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.990
 have enough escape area I like 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.640
 much of this track is one of mine 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.580
 preferred 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.010
 those who accompanied mtv know that the second 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.190
 test of the day at mitsubishi lancer camp 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.700
 has an extra pinch of adrenaline 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.160
 start is reversed or who has arrived 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.200
 in eighth will drop in pole position and 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.820
 who was the big winner in the first 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.580
 will drop in the eighth position with the 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.940
 grid inverted bruno mosque dropped in 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.100
 seventh place in the second race and 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.750
 to impose a strong rhythm and seek 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.610
 overtaking 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.660
 the race was very good, even better 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.240
 Race was getting very nervous. 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.960
 when someone comes in you go 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.580
 able to hold these laps there was 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.370
 very good really good 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.280
 after eight tests bruno leads the 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.790
 championship with 162 points 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.750
 and it helps comes right behind with 147 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.990
 points 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.330
 happy a fierce but super 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.100
 fair in was really cool 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.710
 take me long to get second 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.569
 bruno managed to open in category 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:28.169
 prize for pilots like this 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:31.020
 45 years old carlos fallet dominated both 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:33.270
 stages and shoots the lead 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.309
 of the overall classification 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.990
 the dispute is always difficult, not because 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.759
 here as I said is a very clue 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.129
 technical the car 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:44.699
 the cars are the same then a mistake you 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.849
 loses positions and then the concentration is 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.849
 fundamental 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.029
 the end of another stage of the 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:56.099
