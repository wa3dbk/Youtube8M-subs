00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.420
 in this video we will learn to do 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:08.610
 a tracing of knots pulsed to have 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.170
 the result like this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.520
 now it was explained how it is done 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.520
 we are going to need 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.040
 six laces 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.890
 of three different colors I have used 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.140
 some laces of 80 centimeters that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.540
 folded in half and I've held them 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.330
 here with a clamp to work 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.510
 with them actually the laces 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 plants as they will not move can 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.730
 be shorter because they are going to be left over 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.730
 with which we are going to help is going to be 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.489
 with the sides, the one that spends the most is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.710
 the external lateral I can not tell you the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.739
 exact measurement but 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.980
 as it crosses constantly is the one that most 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.780
 They spent two plants worth the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.610
 let's say the length we want 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 make the lace 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.970
 let's start as I said the couple 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.390
 are placed in pairs and we use three 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.310
 colors the central couple serves as a guide 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.310
 and it's never going to move 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.190
 we started crossing these laces that 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.300
 would be the intermediates in the case are a 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.700
 mustard color 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.100
 so that you understand me the mustard of the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.310
 right crosses to the left by 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.250
 underneath the centrals and the mustard 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 the left crosses to the right by 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 below the centrals 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.570
 we have crossed them, the centrals 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 keep in place 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.430
 now we would start moving the grays 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.400
 which are the external sides 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.940
 we started with the right side that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.940
 we would pass 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 below mustard that has its 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.880
 side 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.299
 we go under and then we're going to pass 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.800
 above the yellow sides and 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.800
 of mustard on the opposite side 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.200
 then take the lateral side 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.840
 left 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.930
 we're going to go over the two 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.990
 that we have already crossed below 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.680
 of the mustard 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.620
 on his side and above the central ones 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.370
 yellow and mustard from the side 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.830
 opposite and then the last step that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.470
 we are left would be to introduce it for this 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.650
 loop that is what 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.770
 and left the first gray when we moved it 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.700
 towards the left side this hole 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.240
 initial 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.240
 Over there 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.170
 and we create and we'll close the knot 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.170
 now we press all 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.250
 and we close this is the knot that is repeated 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.090
 all the time 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.640
 in this bracelet does not distinguish much 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.190
 the yellow mustard but if you put 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.300
 colors that contrast more will be left 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.300
 much prettier 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.040
 I repeat it again we start crossing 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.100
 these intermediates below 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.800
 centers on the right goes from 100 to 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.990
 from the left goes to the right 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.340
 we already have the first step after 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.800
 we take the lateral gray and we pass it by 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.980
 under the mustard on its side and by 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.240
 on top of the plants and mustard 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.610
 contrary 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.060
 we take the other gray on the opposite side 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.530
 we passed it over this gray by 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.530
 under the first mustard 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.120
 and above the intermediate ones I know of 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.099
 mustard 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.710
 on the opposite side and now then 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:19.170
 we introduce through this loop 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.170
 down to close the knot 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.300
 we have 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.560
 the terminal knot we always press the same 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.560
 so that the knots remain 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.639
 with the same width 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.210
 I repeat others 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.210
 for you to see 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.190
 the left another the right 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.770
 under 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.840
 above leaving a booking 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.410
 this we pass over 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.410
 under 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.930
 above these and inside 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.140
 and we wait 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.500
 everything is at the same time 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.689
 we have another finished knot 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:37.779
 do not forget, go through the blog to 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.799
 see the photos in step by step and the 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.799
 finished bracelet
