00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
how I why would you why would a safety

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.180 
how I why would you why would a safety
not<00:05:08.690> be<00:05:08.870> back<00:05:09.050> there<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.320> think<00:05:09.590> he<00:05:10.040> was

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
not be back there I think he was

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.440 
not be back there I think he was
adjusting<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.790> play<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.210> he<00:05:11.300> had

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
adjusting the play and he had

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.540 
adjusting the play and he had
accidentally<00:05:12.230> brought<00:05:12.350> his<00:05:12.500> safety<00:05:12.710> up<00:05:13.010> which

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
accidentally brought his safety up which

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.860 
accidentally brought his safety up which
allowed<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.000> play<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.270> happen<00:05:14.570> so<00:05:14.660> we<00:05:14.750> get

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
allowed that play to happen so we get

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.090 
allowed that play to happen so we get
really<00:05:14.960> lucky<00:05:15.170> and<00:05:15.350> we<00:05:15.500> finished<00:05:15.740> with<00:05:15.860> points
