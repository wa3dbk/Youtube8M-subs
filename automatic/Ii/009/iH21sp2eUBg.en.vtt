00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that they're all dark compared to the

normal lighter icons and then even if

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
normal lighter icons and then even if
you<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.500> an<00:00:43.590> icon<00:00:43.920> such<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.309> Twitter<00:00:44.550> or

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you do have an icon such as Twitter or

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750

some random applications such as realtor
it's<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> put<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.620> dark

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's also going to put it in that dark
box<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> thought<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> pretty<00:00:51.719> cool

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

new picture up here and the new theme
right<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.159> it's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
right here I really do like that it's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
right here I really do like that it's
kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> blue<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.360> dark<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
kind of blue and then dark and it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
kind of blue and then dark and it
switches<00:01:10.260> off<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.250> thought<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
switches off and on I thought that was a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
switches off and on I thought that was a
pretty<00:01:12.299> cool<00:01:12.689> feature<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pretty cool feature they did to that and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
pretty cool feature they did to that and
if<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.010> actually<00:01:14.460> move<00:01:14.640> over<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> right

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
if we actually move over to the right

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
if we actually move over to the right
and<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.750> look<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> other<00:01:16.500> weather<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and you look at the other weather and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770

your texting application or you're just
on<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.759> ipod<00:01:30.150> touch<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.930> your

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
on your ipod touch and this is your

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
on your ipod touch and this is your
actual<00:01:31.259> messages<00:01:31.920> application<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.759> imessage

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
actual messages application for imessage

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
actual messages application for imessage
this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.110> what's<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.829> you're

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this is what's going to look like you're

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
this is what's going to look like you're
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> blue<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> green<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
going to have a blue and then a green so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950 
going to have a blue and then a green so
it<00:01:37.560> basically<00:01:37.770> separates<00:01:38.759> who's<00:01:39.180> talking<00:01:39.720> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it basically separates who's talking and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
it basically separates who's talking and
I<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> same<00:01:41.130> normally

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I know that it's like the same normally

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.179 
I know that it's like the same normally
but<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> square<00:01:43.649> box<00:01:43.829> for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this one and the keyboard is the same if

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
this one and the keyboard is the same if
you<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> color<00:01:47.880> keyboard<00:01:48.329> sweet<00:01:48.840> you're

actually<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.590> able<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
actually going to be able to have a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429 
actually going to be able to have a
custom<00:01:50.640> keyboard<00:01:50.820> also<00:01:51.299> made<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
custom keyboard also made for it but I

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
custom keyboard also made for it but I
don't<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.159> obviously<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.119> do

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
don't have that so obviously I can do

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480
