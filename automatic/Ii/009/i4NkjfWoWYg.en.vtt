00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
cheap and then a screen protector this

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.569 
cheap and then a screen protector this
actually<00:01:52.090> feels<00:01:52.569> pretty<00:01:53.499> similar<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.490> the

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
actually feels pretty similar to the

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.669 
actually feels pretty similar to the
other<00:01:54.609> one<00:01:54.909> if<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:55.960> look<00:01:56.140> real<00:01:56.380> closely

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
other one if you look real closely

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.179 
other one if you look real closely
there's<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.100> little<00:01:57.219> bit<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.810> glitter<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.139> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
there's a little bit of a glitter to it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.779 
there's a little bit of a glitter to it
I<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.859> if<00:02:03.069> that's<00:02:03.280> supposed<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.759> be

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
I don't know if that's supposed to be

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.090 
I don't know if that's supposed to be
the<00:02:04.479> diamond<00:02:04.840> coating<00:02:05.229> but<00:02:05.439> I<00:02:05.469> would<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.799> it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the diamond coating but I would think it

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.729 
the diamond coating but I would think it
would<00:02:06.189> be<00:02:06.310> just<00:02:06.869> distracting<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.470> screen

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
would be just distracting on the screen

would be just distracting on the screen
who<00:02:08.920> knows
