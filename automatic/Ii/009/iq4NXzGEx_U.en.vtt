00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
natural and they're really really tough

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.459 
natural and they're really really tough
so<00:02:04.210> they<00:02:04.329> do<00:02:04.390> asked<00:02:04.780> her<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.899> little<00:02:05.079> bit<00:02:05.289> longer

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
so they do asked her a little bit longer

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.010

these<00:02:06.340> are<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.789> pet<00:02:07.149> shop<00:02:07.420> brand<00:02:07.719> which<00:02:07.899> I

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
these are the pet shop brand which I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
these are the pet shop brand which I
believe<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.619> walgreens<00:02:09.160> fran<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
believe it's just walgreens fran the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.150 
believe it's just walgreens fran the
reason<00:02:10.660> i<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:10.750> these<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.440> because<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.980> are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
reason i got these is because there are

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.790 
reason i got these is because there are

and there
you<00:02:15.470> thick<00:02:15.740> if<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.190> tell<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.210> was

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570

but I saw it and just had to get it it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.840 
but I saw it and just had to get it it
is<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:46.450> new<00:02:47.450> bed<00:02:47.810> she<00:02:48.530> actually<00:02:48.680> has<00:02:49.070> 3<00:02:49.550> beds

is a new bed she actually has 3 beds
already<00:02:50.120> now<00:02:50.960> shall<00:02:51.200> have<00:02:51.380> four<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.980> really

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
already now shall have four I really

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.740 
already now shall have four I really
have<00:02:52.790> no<00:02:52.940> idea<00:02:52.970> where<00:02:53.330> I'm<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.570> put<00:02:53.720> this

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
have no idea where I'm going to put this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.300 
have no idea where I'm going to put this
but<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.110> thought<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.380> was<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:54.680> cool<00:02:54.980> because

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
but I thought it was really cool because

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.970 
but I thought it was really cool because
as<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.450> see<00:02:56.570> here<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.350> normal<00:02:57.620> bed

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
as you can see here it's a normal bed

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.670 
as you can see here it's a normal bed
but<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> top<00:02:59.120> pops<00:02:59.450> open<00:02:59.690> into<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.440> dome

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
but the top pops open into like a dome

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.650 
but the top pops open into like a dome
and<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.820> thought<00:03:01.970> I'd<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.210> really<00:03:02.360> fun

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I thought I'd be really fun

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.420 
and I thought I'd be really fun
hopefully<00:03:03.020> she'll<00:03:03.470> go<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.280> be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
hopefully she'll go in it and not be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.040 
hopefully she'll go in it and not be
afraid<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.030> I'll<00:03:05.300> probably<00:03:05.660> put<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.020> a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
afraid of it I'll probably put like a

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.140 
afraid of it I'll probably put like a
treat<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.590> there<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.920> make<00:03:07.040> her<00:03:07.160> go<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.550> but

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
treat in there to make her go in but

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.240 
treat in there to make her go in but
thought<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.360> was<00:03:08.450> really<00:03:08.600> cute<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.950> a

thought it was really cute it's just a
bed<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.330> dogs<00:03:11.840> small<00:03:12.470> dogs<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.130> cats<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:14.600> is
