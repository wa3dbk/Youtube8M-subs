pillows that I was planning on throwing

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
away but I kept them just in case I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.930 
away but I kept them just in case I
needed<00:05:04.170> them<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.620> use<00:05:04.740> roughly<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:05.820> is

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
needed them to use roughly and this is

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.670 
needed them to use roughly and this is
perfect<00:05:06.390> because<00:05:06.480> we're<00:05:07.260> going<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.440> be<00:05:07.560> taking

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
perfect because we're going to be taking

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.160 
perfect because we're going to be taking
our<00:05:07.890> own<00:05:08.040> pillows<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.450> one<00:05:09.630> sheet<00:05:09.960> to

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
our own pillows and just one sheet to

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.840 
our own pillows and just one sheet to
the<00:05:10.290> hospital<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:10.980> we're<00:05:11.130> taking<00:05:11.400> this<00:05:11.610> one

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
the hospital and we're taking this one

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.430 
the hospital and we're taking this one
because<00:05:12.090> afterwards<00:05:12.840> we<00:05:13.020> don't<00:05:13.170> have<00:05:13.320> to

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
because afterwards we don't have to

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.050 
because afterwards we don't have to
bring<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.770> back<00:05:13.890> we'll<00:05:14.160> just<00:05:14.370> toss<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.610> there

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
bring it back we'll just toss it there

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.810 
bring it back we'll just toss it there
so<00:05:15.690> they<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.680> hospital<00:05:17.160> recommend<00:05:17.550> that<00:05:17.700> if

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
so they the hospital recommend that if

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.250 
so they the hospital recommend that if
you<00:05:17.910> do<00:05:18.030> bring<00:05:18.210> your<00:05:18.360> own<00:05:18.450> pillows<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:19.020> don't

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
you do bring your own pillows you don't

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.470 
you do bring your own pillows you don't
bring<00:05:19.470> white<00:05:19.740> pillow<00:05:20.460> cases<00:05:20.730> or<00:05:21.000> white<00:05:21.150> sheets

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
bring white pillow cases or white sheets

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.170 
bring white pillow cases or white sheets
because<00:05:21.630> that's<00:05:21.870> what<00:05:22.050> they're<00:05:22.230> using<00:05:23.180> so

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
because that's what they're using so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.060

going on so I'm going to take this

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.949 
going on so I'm going to take this
that<00:06:38.580> way<00:06:38.759> we<00:06:38.999> don't<00:06:39.089> have<00:06:39.209> to<00:06:39.330> worry<00:06:39.599> about<00:06:39.719> if

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:39.959 
that way we don't have to worry about if

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.540 
that way we don't have to worry about if
it<00:06:40.080> gets<00:06:40.229> dirty<00:06:40.409> you're<00:06:40.709> lost<00:06:40.919> or<00:06:41.129> stolen<00:06:41.309> so

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
it gets dirty you're lost or stolen so

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.159 
it gets dirty you're lost or stolen so
this<00:06:41.669> is<00:06:41.789> a<00:06:41.819> baby's<00:06:42.209> bag<00:06:42.419> with<00:06:42.719> the<00:06:42.869> baby's

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
this is a baby's bag with the baby's

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.669 
this is a baby's bag with the baby's
coming<00:06:43.529> home<00:06:43.800> outfit<00:06:44.219> and<00:06:45.589> diapers<00:06:46.589> and

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:46.679 
coming home outfit and diapers and

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:48.949 
coming home outfit and diapers and
things<00:06:47.009> like<00:06:47.189> that<00:06:47.249> so<00:06:47.699> that's<00:06:48.360> pretty<00:06:48.749> much

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
things like that so that's pretty much

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.219 
things like that so that's pretty much
it<00:06:49.199> I<00:06:50.039> think<00:06:50.580> we're<00:06:50.789> pad<00:06:51.179> light<00:06:51.509> it<00:06:51.749> just<00:06:51.959> looks

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
it I think we're pad light it just looks

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.859 
it I think we're pad light it just looks
like<00:06:52.349> it's<00:06:52.649> a<00:06:52.769> lot<00:06:52.979> because<00:06:53.429> of<00:06:54.149> the<00:06:54.509> pillows

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:54.869 
like it's a lot because of the pillows

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:56.719 
like it's a lot because of the pillows
on<00:06:55.019> the<00:06:55.050> sheets<00:06:55.439> and<00:06:55.739> the<00:06:55.769> fact<00:06:56.279> that<00:06:56.429> this<00:06:56.610> is

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
on the sheets and the fact that this is

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.959 
on the sheets and the fact that this is
so<00:06:56.939> big<00:06:57.269> and<00:06:57.509> green<00:06:57.949> but<00:06:58.949> I<00:06:59.309> think<00:06:59.789> this<00:06:59.909> is

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
so big and green but I think this is

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.329 
so big and green but I think this is
pretty<00:07:00.360> basic<00:07:00.659> stuff<00:07:00.959> the<00:07:01.619> only<00:07:01.860> last<00:07:02.039> minute

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:02.339 
pretty basic stuff the only last minute

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.889 
pretty basic stuff the only last minute
things<00:07:02.519> like<00:07:02.669> I<00:07:02.789> mentioned<00:07:02.999> will<00:07:03.389> be<00:07:03.539> a<00:07:03.569> chore

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:03.899 
things like I mentioned will be a chore

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.799 
things like I mentioned will be a chore
