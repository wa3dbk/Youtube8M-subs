00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.370
 We give so much attention to the motto 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.370
 you arrived 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.250
 just thought makes one with you 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.400
 video from the kitchen so something you her 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.480
 can make faster 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.970
 No, I do not do that today 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.060
 together and you would have made courage 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.460
 and I'll show you today like that 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.989
 works and I'm very excited 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 would also for the first time make 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 and I wanted to do with my niece 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.510
 I actually can because I can 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.980
 also movies 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.989
 That's why we do it together 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.309
 what you need is cocoa and 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.199
 Although you have to pay attention that is 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.350
 weak and it is I do not know 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.710
 why but that was in the recipes 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.750
 and therefore bought at market purchase then 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.290
 you need a chalkboard chocolate pc the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.960
 taken from blind and then you need 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.450
 Of course decorative glasses are 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.990
 now the ones I have here we have 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.490
 no market buys almost nothing 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.259
 a bit of sunflower oil but me 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
 I have heard my today's color collection 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.310
 Of course, now it does not 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.159
 Bought but what I found in the closet 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.990
 I had walnut oil and I think so 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:46.689
 maybe you could do that too 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:46.689
 make that went by itself 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.549
 yes, so can make the decorative 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.049
 I look up but show it 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.090
 I'll finish you in that 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.480
 easy can and very short to tal 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.790
 calmly 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.580
 and the bride brews exactly 100 grams and in the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.110
 Attacks are also exactly 100 grams circle 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.650
 Shortened to hazel nuts 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.330
 judge 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.920
 and then you take that one please 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.450
 down as soon as you put that down 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.910
 you can have a pot with you right away 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.130
 boiling water and in the meantime 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.820
 Just make the rest as well as find 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.020
 I actually 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.610
 then I have such a small one here 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:30.250
 businessman max dittmann motor and there give 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:31.480
 we now simply this must in this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.110
 container in here, however, is relative 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 poor 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 I think you just have to go here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 on it and then just here on it 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.160
 press and then do that and that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.160
 you have to grind finely 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.140
 it is already a little bit 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.969
 fit a bit for beaten 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 to lump a bit and then give 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.260
 you henry the oil with it and that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:12.340
 one to two tablespoons i can now 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:14.680
 First of all with a man still need 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:38.049
 a little bit more like it sees itself 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:40.989
 We then just about needs 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.680
 At home we work now completely 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.450
 behind 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.879
 this is now slowly starting to boil 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.959
 this type currently at tchibo and the 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.639
 Now we have a conference too 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.049
 had something like that but not yet 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:55.840
 and who knows, in turn, attracts need 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.069
 So that's good for the chocolate or bad 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.659
 takes just the chocolate and 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.220
 Gives the ready in this little bowl 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.220
 and wait until it 's melted 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.590
 then we all still have the hazelnut 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:19.870
 are you doing now comes a tablespoon of 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.639
 We'll give that buyhold and then we'll give it 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.639
 our melted chocolate with it 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.300
 then he gives the lid back on it and 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.300
 With 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.180
 Try and said again tastes 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.930
 but my sweetheart was not a bit 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.290
 burn taste than some paralysis 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.210
 this clichÃ© what i have here i have 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.350
 like this our glasses which was called this 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.150
 I just love that 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.830
 and then we just find these 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.270
 chocolates what you put in here 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.830
 I do not know if it is like this 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.180
 The jam is that the gas 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.010
 I do not have to turn around 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.420
 sure but I just want that now 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.230
 let's see how much out of it 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.400
 so it comes easy for this glass loppet 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.710
 I really get the perfect dose 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.480
 even if just yourself positive 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.150
 surprised and then I close 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.900
 now just the lid and there on 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.220
 best in the fridge 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.660
 so of course now have the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.830
 possibility to decorate it and me 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.300
 I'm just happy myself how I do that 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.190
 But I'll see why holding something 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.160
 bring it for what I to 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.200
 breakfast or so for yourself 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.190
 Homemade things I always find too 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 I think I'm real 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.850
 I thought so now 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.580
 somehow with a napkin or with 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.820
 such a sticker or if we are so 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.820
 true 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.860
 somehow so here you can still something 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.610
 I'll write that on you 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.289
 now 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.339
 I just want it here now 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.550
 therefore turn attach and then just like that 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.459
 give away 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.360
 for this little video or fast 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:16.129
 Video made fun and I would 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.659
 really look forward to feedback and empire 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.339
 Of course, give away something and of course 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.739
 if so what and of course how it is 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.879
 has arrived and now you still want 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:25.129
 Let's say something about it 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.399
 spent so basically 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:32.749
 the hazelnuts I think have 60 70 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:34.419
 cents have actually tasted cocoa powder 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:36.919
 everyone at home 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.619
 Everyone has oil at home, too 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.179
 Bought 150 for the milk chocolate 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:42.830
 but if you are good you can too 

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:46.939
 good friends chocolat for 50 cents 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.969
 get and the most expensive was just this 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:54.349
 container and two pieces in it and the 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:55.849
 Costs have two pieces of 599 but 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.409
 there you have to have us in any case 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.149
 ever two presents for under 10 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.919
 euro and is definitely something for yourself 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.839
 is done and I believe something like that is coming 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.949
 always really good at this 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.419
 cream is still a bit for now 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.249
 the complete books and will become 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.289
 In any case, and if you know 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.279
 okay we want that in 20 minutes now 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.719
 eat a dog shot 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:15.860
 charcoal then it will be 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:17.959
 a little spreadable so I would 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.449
 about feedback as I said, and I am happy 

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:22.639
 have another variant of what 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.689
 nobody gives away from the kitchen and the 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.689
 I will then synonymous again reduced
