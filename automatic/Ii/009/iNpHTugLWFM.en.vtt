gate<00:00:21.730> issue<00:00:21.970> I<00:00:22.360> think<00:00:23.110> we<00:00:23.890> might<00:00:24.220> have<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.430> fix

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
gate issue I think we might have a fix

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.540 
gate issue I think we might have a fix
instead<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.560> having<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.860> worry<00:00:27.009> about<00:00:27.130> using<00:00:27.490> a

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
instead of having to worry about using a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.100 
instead of having to worry about using a
straw<00:00:27.880> or<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.210> piece<00:00:28.450> of<00:00:28.599> paper<00:00:28.720> or<00:00:28.990> whatever

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
out in this situation we have something

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.900 
out in this situation we have something
where<00:00:34.809> you<00:00:35.680> might<00:00:35.710> not<00:00:36.370> ever<00:00:36.580> have<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.820> worry

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
where you might not ever have to worry

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.410 
where you might not ever have to worry
about<00:00:37.089> that<00:00:37.269> again<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.760> first<00:00:40.000> half<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.300> this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
about that again the first half of this

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.299 
about that again the first half of this
I<00:00:40.570> did<00:00:40.720> off-camera<00:00:41.199> but<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.650> next<00:00:41.920> half<00:00:42.070> is

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
I did off-camera but the next half is

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.790 
I did off-camera but the next half is
the<00:00:42.460> exact<00:00:42.820> same<00:00:43.089> process<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:44.019> I'll<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.769> on

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the exact same process and I'll do on

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.040 
the exact same process and I'll do on
camera<00:00:45.280> for<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.640> guys<00:00:45.820> right<00:00:46.120> now<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.840> key<00:00:50.020> is

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
camera for you guys right now the key is

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.319 
camera for you guys right now the key is
to<00:00:50.200> shave<00:00:50.559> off<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.070> protruding<00:00:51.670> edge<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:52.180> the

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
to shave off that protruding edge on the

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.760 
to shave off that protruding edge on the
s-pen<00:00:52.960> click<00:00:53.379> mechanism<00:00:55.320> trust<00:00:56.320> me<00:00:56.469> I<00:00:56.500> tried

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
s-pen click mechanism trust me I tried

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.410 
s-pen click mechanism trust me I tried
to<00:00:56.890> find<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.219> simplest<00:00:57.640> way<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.789> do<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.180> I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
to find the simplest way to do this I

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.180 
to find the simplest way to do this I
tried<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.930> use<00:00:59.079> fingernail<00:00:59.800> clippers

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
tried to use fingernail clippers

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.639 
tried to use fingernail clippers
whatever<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:00.609> could<00:01:00.850> find<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.359> it<00:01:02.260> was<00:01:02.469> just

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
whatever I could find and it was just

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.100 
whatever I could find and it was just
too<00:01:02.859> thick<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.309> have<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:04.030> use<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.270> dremel<00:01:04.629> so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
too thick I have to use a dremel so

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.380 
too thick I have to use a dremel so
before<00:01:05.649> you<00:01:05.740> do<00:01:05.890> this<00:01:06.039> if<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.520> do<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.850> you're

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
before you do this if you do this you're

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.940 
before you do this if you do this you're
going<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.539> want<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.750> use<00:01:07.840> protective<00:01:08.350> hand

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
going to want to use protective hand

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.700 
going to want to use protective hand
wear<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.430> eyewear<00:01:10.229> we're<00:01:11.229> going<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.410> be<00:01:11.470> using

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
wear and eyewear we're going to be using

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.980 
wear and eyewear we're going to be using
a<00:01:11.770> dremel<00:01:11.920> tool<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.940> reason<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.420> s-pen<00:01:16.750> gets

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
a dremel tool the reason the s-pen gets

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.020 
a dremel tool the reason the s-pen gets
stuck<00:01:17.289> backwards<00:01:18.100> inside<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.610> phone<00:01:18.759> at<00:01:18.909> all

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
stuck backwards inside the phone at all

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.100 
stuck backwards inside the phone at all
is<00:01:19.240> because<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.229> clicking<00:01:20.590> mechanism

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
is because of the clicking mechanism

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.300 
is because of the clicking mechanism
when<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.200> try<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.530> pull<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> estime<00:01:24.100> back

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
when you try and pull the estime back

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.190 
when you try and pull the estime back
out<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> slot<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.330> clicking<00:01:25.689> mechanism

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
out of the slot the clicking mechanism

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.100 
out of the slot the clicking mechanism
gets<00:01:26.380> caught<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.740> lever<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.540> goal<00:01:28.780> here

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
gets caught in the lever the goal here

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.050 
gets caught in the lever the goal here
is<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.500> remove<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.860> protruding<00:01:30.400> sides<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:31.000> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
is to remove the protruding sides of the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.410 
is to remove the protruding sides of the
clicking<00:01:31.390> mechanism<00:01:31.869> from<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.049> s-pen

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
clicking mechanism from the s-pen

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.819 
clicking mechanism from the s-pen
there's<00:01:34.420> no<00:01:34.659> need<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:34.900> remove<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.409> edges<00:01:35.740> from

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
there's no need to remove the edges from

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.530 
there's no need to remove the edges from
the<00:01:35.950> front<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.579> back<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.150> clicking

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the front and back of the clicking

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.020 
the front and back of the clicking
mechanism<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:39.159> those<00:01:39.430> don't<00:01:39.700> touch<00:01:39.850> the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
mechanism because those don't touch the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.679 
mechanism because those don't touch the
lever<00:01:40.270> inside<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:41.079> s-pen<00:01:41.470> slot<00:01:42.570> even<00:01:43.570> though

lever inside the s-pen slot even though
the<00:01:43.840> lever<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.229> only<00:01:44.409> on<00:01:44.590> one<00:01:44.860> side<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.579> do

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
the lever is only on one side you do

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.370 
the lever is only on one side you do
need<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.060> make<00:01:46.180> sure<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.600> shave<00:01:46.810> down<00:01:47.020> both

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
need to make sure to shave down both

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.330 
need to make sure to shave down both
sides<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.340> s-pen<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.220> no

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
s-pen you don't have to worry about

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.790 
s-pen you don't have to worry about
getting<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.909> caught<00:01:55.119> on<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.420> lever

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.890 

now<00:02:02.800> 100%<00:02:03.280> satisfied<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.300> this<00:02:04.450> yet<00:02:04.720> so

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
now 100% satisfied with this yet so
