unbeknownst to you of course you are in
for<00:01:28.450> quite<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.659> fight<00:01:28.960> simply<00:01:29.229> because<00:01:29.829> the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
for quite a fight simply because the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.310 
for quite a fight simply because the
antibiotics<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.390> would<00:01:31.540> normally<00:01:31.899> use<00:01:31.930> would

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
antibiotics we would normally use would

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.590 
antibiotics we would normally use would
not<00:01:32.500> work<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.189> get<00:01:33.340> rid<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.420> there's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
not work to get rid of it and so there's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.240 
not work to get rid of it and so there's
only<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.930> limited<00:01:35.170> number<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.619> antibiotics

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
only a limited number of antibiotics

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.459 
only a limited number of antibiotics
that<00:01:36.340> work<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.299> problem<00:01:37.659> with<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.200> of

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
that work the problem with this is of

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.380 
that work the problem with this is of
course<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.950> many<00:01:39.250> doctors<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:39.969> long<00:01:40.180> long

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
course that many doctors for a long long

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.179 
course that many doctors for a long long
time<00:01:40.600> we're<00:01:40.810> not<00:01:40.960> recognizing<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:41.950> we're

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
time we're not recognizing this we're

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.859 
time we're not recognizing this we're
thinking<00:01:42.219> of<00:01:42.549> something<00:01:42.969> else<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.420> they

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
thinking of something else and they

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.450 
thinking of something else and they
would<00:01:43.990> prescribe<00:01:44.290> an<00:01:44.590> antibiotic<00:01:44.799> if<00:01:45.280> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
would prescribe an antibiotic if the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.550 
would prescribe an antibiotic if the
infection<00:01:45.820> would<00:01:46.030> just<00:01:46.240> rage<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.990> spread

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
infection would just rage and spread

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.890 
infection would just rage and spread
through<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.829> body<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.369> cause

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
through the body and cause

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.950 
through the body and cause
relatively<00:01:49.320> quick<00:01:49.800> death<00:01:50.660> with<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.690> lot<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
relatively quick death with a lot of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.760 
relatively quick death with a lot of
fever<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.530> pain<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> invasion<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.150> lungs

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
fever and pain and invasion of the lungs

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.400 
fever and pain and invasion of the lungs
and<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.160> Maren<00:01:56.640> McKenna<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.540> book<00:01:57.870> has

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
and so Maren McKenna in this book has

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.620 
and so Maren McKenna in this book has
taken<00:01:58.800> some<00:01:58.980> time<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.400> investigate<00:01:59.940> the

taken some time to investigate the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.530 
taken some time to investigate the
appearance<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> mersa<00:02:01.850> ways<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.150> has<00:02:03.330> been

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
appearance of mersa ways that has been

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.420 
appearance of mersa ways that has been

hospitals<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.930> CDC<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.479> doctors

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
hospitals and the CDC so that doctors

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750

brand new drugs that are specifically

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.610 
brand new drugs that are specifically
targeted<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.940> certain<00:04:19.390> features<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:20.080> cancer

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
targeted to certain features of cancer

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.830 
targeted to certain features of cancer
cells<00:04:20.860> that<00:04:21.130> are<00:04:21.310> not<00:04:21.489> showing<00:04:21.970> up<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.330> normal

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
cells that are not showing up in normal

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.870 
cells that are not showing up in normal
cells<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.860> only<00:04:23.890> thing<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.520> was<00:04:24.700> missing

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
cells the only thing that was missing

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.600 
cells the only thing that was missing
from<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.360> book<00:04:25.600> but<00:04:26.170> he<00:04:26.440> justs<00:04:26.980> ever<00:04:27.280> so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
from this book but he justs ever so

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.990 
from this book but he justs ever so
lightly<00:04:27.820> touched<00:04:28.420> on<00:04:30.000> anti-angiogenesis

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
lightly touched on anti-angiogenesis

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.940 
lightly touched on anti-angiogenesis
drugs<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.660> these<00:04:31.810> are<00:04:31.990> drugs<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:32.260> stop<00:04:32.680> the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
drugs and these are drugs that stop the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.590 
drugs and these are drugs that stop the
growth<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.430> blood<00:04:33.640> vessels<00:04:33.700> because<00:04:34.300> cancer

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
growth of blood vessels because cancer

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.900 
growth of blood vessels because cancer
seems<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.140> be<00:04:35.230> able<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.410> draw<00:04:35.770> blood<00:04:36.460> vessels

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
seems to be able to draw blood vessels

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.510 
seems to be able to draw blood vessels
unto<00:04:37.060> itself<00:04:37.510> using<00:04:37.960> specific<00:04:38.440> chemicals<00:04:38.920> and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
unto itself using specific chemicals and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.340 
unto itself using specific chemicals and
so<00:04:39.640> there<00:04:39.760> were<00:04:39.850> drugs<00:04:40.090> created<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.140> think

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
so there were drugs created and I think

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.040 
so there were drugs created and I think
there's<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.560> lovely<00:04:42.190> story<00:04:42.760> behind<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.390> an

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
there's a lovely story behind that an

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.780 
there's a lovely story behind that an
amazing<00:04:44.320> story<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:44.830> how<00:04:45.040> these<00:04:45.190> drugs<00:04:45.520> came

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
amazing story of how these drugs came

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.370 
amazing story of how these drugs came
about<00:04:46.120> once<00:04:46.480> again<00:04:46.750> just<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.230> other

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
about once again just like the other

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.380 
about once again just like the other
book<00:04:47.560> there's<00:04:47.980> stories<00:04:48.400> where<00:04:48.700> people<00:04:49.180> pass

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
book there's stories where people pass

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.240 
book there's stories where people pass
on<00:04:49.600> them<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.200> then<00:04:50.410> there<00:04:50.620> are<00:04:50.680> stories<00:04:51.070> of

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
on them and then there are stories of

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.510 
on them and then there are stories of
hope<00:04:51.460> where<00:04:51.760> they<00:04:51.940> survive<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.980> think

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
hope where they survive and so I think

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.580 
hope where they survive and so I think
