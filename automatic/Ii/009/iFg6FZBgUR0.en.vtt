lately all I've been wanting to fly and
work<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.520> multirotors<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.540> want<00:00:06.690> to

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779

just<00:00:49.320> made<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> coroplast<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
just made them out of coroplast now this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.880 
just made them out of coroplast now this
version<00:00:51.570> worked<00:00:51.899> great<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> frame<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
version worked great but the frame was a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.470 
version worked great but the frame was a
bit<00:00:53.070> bent<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.789> motors<00:00:54.120> were<00:00:54.270> half

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
bit bent and the right motors were half

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.299 
bit bent and the right motors were half
an<00:00:54.660> inch<00:00:54.780> closer<00:00:55.050> than<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> left<00:00:55.710> motors<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
an inch closer than the left motors I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
an inch closer than the left motors I
wanted<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> frame<00:00:57.690> better<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
wanted to make the frame better get a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380 
wanted to make the frame better get a
more<00:00:58.649> straight<00:00:59.010> make<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> bigger<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.820> painted

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
more straight make it bigger and painted

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
more straight make it bigger and painted
so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> made<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> completely<00:01:01.649> new<00:01:01.800> frame<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so I made a completely new frame and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
so I made a completely new frame and
Knuckles<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> same<00:01:03.149> materials<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Knuckles out of the same materials I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539 
Knuckles out of the same materials I
felt<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> previous<00:01:05.129> frame<00:01:05.339> was

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
felt that the previous frame was

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
felt that the previous frame was
unstable<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> roll<00:01:06.390> axis<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> made<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
unstable on the roll axis so I made the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
unstable on the roll axis so I made the
motor<00:01:07.710> arms<00:01:08.040> 11<00:01:08.369> inches<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
motor arms 11 inches long with the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.660 
motor arms 11 inches long with the
middle<00:01:09.450> arms<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.780> 10<00:01:09.960> inches<00:01:10.229> long<00:01:10.520> not<00:01:11.520> only

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
middle arms are 10 inches long not only

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
middle arms are 10 inches long not only
by<00:01:11.850> doing<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.720> stable<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
by doing that is it more stable it is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.760 
by doing that is it more stable it is
also<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> lot<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.100> quiet<00:01:15.200> since<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> frame<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
also a lot more quiet since the frame is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
also a lot more quiet since the frame is
larger<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.580> increased<00:01:18.090> stick<00:01:18.299> scaling<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
larger I also increased stick scaling to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.649 
larger I also increased stick scaling to
75<00:01:19.229> run<00:01:19.409> roll<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> pitch<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> yaw<00:01:20.340> still<00:01:20.790> 35<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
75 run roll in pitch and yaw still 35 I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
75 run roll in pitch and yaw still 35 I
also<00:01:22.409> still<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.860> coroplast<00:01:23.310> Center<00:01:23.640> frame

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
also still have coroplast Center frame

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
also still have coroplast Center frame
plates<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.530> aerobatic

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
plates I don't just want to do aerobatic
all<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> time<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> flashed<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.450> kk2<00:01:27.840> board

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
that firmware allows for multiple
profiles<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.810> I've<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.110> set<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.500> aerobatics

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
profiles so I've one set for aerobatics

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
profiles so I've one set for aerobatics
and<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.369> set<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.939> flying<00:01:36.180> around<00:01:36.500> here

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and one set for just flying around here

00:01:37.500 --> 00:02:03.890 
and one set for just flying around here
are<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.799> flight<00:01:37.979> footage<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> new<00:01:38.670> frame

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:17.420 

I<00:02:15.440> needed<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.590> land<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:17.310> my

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I needed to land here because my

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
I needed to land here because my
elevator<00:02:17.910> trim<00:02:18.060> tab<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> broken<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.080> he<00:02:19.110> needed

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
elevator trim tab is broken so he needed

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.320 
elevator trim tab is broken so he needed
to<00:02:19.590> use<00:02:19.680> sub<00:02:19.980> trims<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.460> trim<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.730> my<00:02:20.910> quarter

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to use sub trims to trim up my quarter

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.090 
to use sub trims to trim up my quarter
because<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.720> was<00:02:21.840> really<00:02:22.170> out<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.530> trim<00:02:22.920> right

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
because it was really out of trim right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:03:38.390 
because it was really out of trim right
now

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.860 

in<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.640> end<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.940> super<00:03:40.330> happy<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.629> this

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
in the end I'm super happy with this

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.210 
in the end I'm super happy with this
frame<00:03:41.110> design<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.650> I'm<00:03:41.739> loving<00:03:42.129> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
frame design and I'm loving the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.259 
frame design and I'm loving the
aerobatics<00:03:42.790> with<00:03:42.940> it

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
aerobatics with it

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.479 
aerobatics with it
I<00:03:43.300> might<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:43.959> FP<00:03:44.349> view<00:03:44.530> with<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.800> but<00:03:45.220> I'm<00:03:45.340> too

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
I might do FP view with this but I'm too

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.070 
I might do FP view with this but I'm too
anxious<00:03:45.730> for<00:03:46.030> my<00:03:46.120> taro<00:03:46.360> gimbal<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.810> think<00:03:46.989> of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
anxious for my taro gimbal to think of

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.960 
anxious for my taro gimbal to think of
