00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
but I got sick of doing that because it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.400 
but I got sick of doing that because it
was<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.300> basically<00:00:54.480> clean<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> case<00:00:55.170> every

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
was like basically clean the case every

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
was like basically clean the case every
day<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> kept<00:00:55.949> getting<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.850> gross

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
day because I kept getting so so gross

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
day because I kept getting so so gross
so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.570> gave<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.829> live<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
so I just gave up and just live with it
I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.730> I'd<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> black<00:01:00.420> model<00:01:00.840> better

I think I'd like the black model better

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
I think I'd like the black model better

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
because I wouldn't show this as much but
it<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.329> dirty<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.019> wouldn't

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it would still be dirty I just wouldn't

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
it would still be dirty I just wouldn't

you actually didn't have a case on my
iPhone<00:01:24.990> 5<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.619> quite<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> while<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
iPhone 5 for quite a while because of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
iPhone 5 for quite a while because of
the<00:01:26.400> headphone<00:01:26.729> jacks<00:01:27.060> they're<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.259> small

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the headphone jacks they're all so small

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
the headphone jacks they're all so small
now<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:29.369> made<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> basically<00:01:29.850> fit

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
now they're made to basically fit

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
now they're made to basically fit
apple's<00:01:30.420> headphones<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.590> apparently<00:01:32.159> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
apple's headphones and apparently all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the headphones i own are too big so I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.620 
the headphones i own are too big so I
can't<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> case<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.479> kind

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
can't use it with the case so that kind

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.910 
can't use it with the case so that kind
of<00:01:36.689> bug<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.740> stopped

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
of bug me a little bit so I just stopped

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.289 
of bug me a little bit so I just stopped
using<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> case<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> while<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.000> using<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
using a case for a while but I'm using a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
using a case for a while but I'm using a
Bluetooth<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.259> why<00:01:40.380> I've<00:01:40.770> been

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
Bluetooth so that's why I've been

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
Bluetooth so that's why I've been
managed<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> keep<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> while<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
managed to keep this on for a while so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.969 
managed to keep this on for a while so
let's<00:01:43.079> take<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> ports<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
let's take a look at all the ports and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.170 
let's take a look at all the ports and
controls<00:01:44.340> I'll<00:01:44.490> show<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> couple<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.970> things

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
controls I'll show a couple other things

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.310 
controls I'll show a couple other things
here<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> bottom<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
here so on the bottom we do have the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.230 
here so on the bottom we do have the
headphone<00:01:46.710> jack<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.640> small<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> wish

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
headphone jack which is too small I wish

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 
headphone jack which is too small I wish
they<00:01:48.390> were<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.810> bigger<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
they were a little bit bigger but if you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
they were a little bit bigger but if you
do<00:01:50.189> use<00:01:50.399> Apple's<00:01:50.759> earbuds<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.930> ones

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
do use Apple's earbuds or I guess ones

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.450 
do use Apple's earbuds or I guess ones
that<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.470> similar<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.070> fine<00:01:53.280> with

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that are similar you'll be fine with

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
that are similar you'll be fine with
that<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.820> Bluetooth<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> probably<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that or Bluetooth which is probably the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.730 
that or Bluetooth which is probably the
best<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> go

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
best way to go

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609
