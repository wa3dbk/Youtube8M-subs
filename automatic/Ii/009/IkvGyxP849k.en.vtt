hello everyone Kyle here again with
another<00:00:04.319> update<00:00:05.089> so<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.180> was<00:00:06.420> hoping<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.290> give

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
another update so I was hoping to give

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.089 
another update so I was hoping to give
you<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> follow-up<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.820> last<00:00:09.240> times<00:00:09.540> update<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
you a follow-up on last times update the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.509 
you a follow-up on last times update the
constructs<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> testicles<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.420> tobacco

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
constructs and testicles in tobacco

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
constructs and testicles in tobacco
however<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.700> hasn't<00:00:14.940> fully<00:00:15.179> worked<00:00:15.750> out<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
however that hasn't fully worked out and

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.779 
however that hasn't fully worked out and
we're<00:00:16.230> still<00:00:16.529> gonna<00:00:16.680> process<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.310> debugging

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
we're still gonna process with debugging

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.210 
we're still gonna process with debugging
that<00:00:18.109> one<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.470> learn<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.650> research

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that one thing you learn about research

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
that one thing you learn about research
this<00:00:20.910> has<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> patient<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.170> perseverance

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
this has to be a patient in perseverance

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.250 
this has to be a patient in perseverance
in<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.670> face<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.970> frustrating<00:00:24.750> results<00:00:25.760> so

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
in the face of frustrating results so

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.599 
in the face of frustrating results so
instead<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.590> figured<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> would<00:00:29.039> talk<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
instead I figured I would talk to you a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
instead I figured I would talk to you a
little<00:00:29.699> bit<00:00:29.970> about<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.929> regeneration

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
little bit about this regeneration

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
little bit about this regeneration
protocol<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.279> which<00:00:32.489> i<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
protocol that we have which i think is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
protocol that we have which i think is
really<00:00:33.329> cool<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.149> exciting<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> share<00:00:36.899> with

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
really cool and exciting to share with

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.090 
really cool and exciting to share with
you<00:00:37.079> guys<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> bit<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.540> background

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
you guys so just as a bit of background

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.280 
you guys so just as a bit of background
most<00:00:41.100> likely<00:00:41.579> you've<00:00:41.760> heard<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:43.050> things

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
most likely you've heard of these things

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.860 
most likely you've heard of these things
called<00:00:43.559> stem<00:00:43.800> cells<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> idea<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
called stem cells this is idea where you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200 
called stem cells this is idea where you
have<00:00:45.899> cells<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.399> turn<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:47.789> any<00:00:48.030> other

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
have cells that can turn into any other

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
have cells that can turn into any other
type<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> cell<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
type of the cell and there's a lot of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
type of the cell and there's a lot of
really<00:00:51.329> exciting<00:00:51.719> potential<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.710> these

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really exciting potential to use these

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
really exciting potential to use these
in<00:00:53.600> medicine<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> take<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.390> stem

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
in medicine so like if you take a stem

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
in medicine so like if you take a stem
cell<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.270> patient<00:01:00.270> just

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cell put it into a patient just

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
cell put it into a patient just
paralyzed<00:01:00.809> could<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> potentially<00:01:01.500> like

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
paralyzed could you potentially like

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.160 
paralyzed could you potentially like
regrow<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.110> neurons<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.880> Georgia<00:01:06.170> or

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
regrow the neurons on to Georgia or

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
regrow the neurons on to Georgia or
could<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> take<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.100> stem<00:01:08.729> cells<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> like

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
could you take a stem cells and like

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
could you take a stem cells and like
regrow<00:01:09.930> heart<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.010> instead<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.340> having<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
regrow heart and instead of having to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.640 
regrow heart and instead of having to
have<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.270> open<00:01:12.570> doors<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.350> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
have you know open doors you can then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.600 
have you know open doors you can then
just<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.790> regrow<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.740> roaming<00:01:16.740> organs<00:01:17.460> for

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
just have regrow your roaming organs for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.510 
just have regrow your roaming organs for
transportation

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
transportation

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
transportation
well<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> same<00:01:21.000> sort<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.509> principle<00:01:22.049> applies

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
well the same sort of principle applies

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
well the same sort of principle applies
in<00:01:22.560> plants<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.549> cases<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.119> want

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
in plants there are cases where we want

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.620 
in plants there are cases where we want
to<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.380> pledge<00:01:25.650> stem<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.270> grow<00:01:27.479> an

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to take a pledge stem so then we grow an

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.130 
to take a pledge stem so then we grow an
entire<00:01:27.720> plant<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.360> stuff<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.689> I'll<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
entire plant and stuff what I'll get to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.490 
entire plant and stuff what I'll get to
Walker<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.829> guys<00:01:32.640> today<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> plants<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> way

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
Walker you guys today and plants the way

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.249 
Walker you guys today and plants the way
we<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.600> really<00:01:36.600> changing<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we do that is really changing to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.370 
we do that is really changing to
different<00:01:38.390> auxins<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> cytokinins<00:01:42.380> oxidants

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
different auxins and cytokinins oxidants

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
different auxins and cytokinins oxidants
involved<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.950> lots<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> things<00:01:44.820> cytokine<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
involved in lots of things cytokine in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.429 
involved in lots of things cytokine in
but<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.610> while<00:01:47.610> ago<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.299> value<00:01:48.990> researchers

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
but a while ago that value researchers

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.950 
but a while ago that value researchers
figured<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.159> can

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
figured out that we can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.320 
figured out that we can
essentially<00:01:51.950> add<00:01:52.130> both<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.400> them<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:52.970> media

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
essentially add both of them to a media

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.859 
essentially add both of them to a media
and<00:01:53.750> get<00:01:53.960> plant<00:01:54.740> stem<00:01:54.979> cells<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:56.479> remove

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
and get plant stem cells and then remove

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.560 
and get plant stem cells and then remove
the<00:01:57.049> oxygen<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.680> kind<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.040> get<00:01:58.190> shoots

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
the oxygen and you kind of get shoots

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.750 
the oxygen and you kind of get shoots
and<00:01:59.570> then<00:01:59.930> remove<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.890> cytokine<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.369> add

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
and then remove the cytokine and add

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.700 
and then remove the cytokine and add
back<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.420> bit<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.720> oxidant<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.350> then

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
back a little bit of oxidant and then

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.830 
back a little bit of oxidant and then
you'll<00:02:03.830> give<00:02:04.009> some<00:02:04.250> groups<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:05.570> what<00:02:05.720> I'll

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
you'll give some groups just what I'll

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.559 
you'll give some groups just what I'll
walk<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.140> here<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.440> show<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.590> yeah<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.729> here

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
walk you here and show you yeah so here

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.559 
walk you here and show you yeah so here
we<00:02:08.869> have<00:02:09.880> some<00:02:11.709> Arab<00:02:12.709> adopts<00:02:12.980> us<00:02:13.130> routes<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.480> he

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
we have some Arab adopts us routes so he

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.360 
we have some Arab adopts us routes so he
chose<00:02:14.750> routes<00:02:15.080> as<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.470> X<00:02:15.620> plan<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> X

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
chose routes as the X plan so the X

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.550 
chose routes as the X plan so the X
plant<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.850> little<00:02:17.120> piece<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.750> fully

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
plant is a little piece of the fully

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.050 
plant is a little piece of the fully
mature<00:02:18.920> plant<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.430> take<00:02:19.640> off<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
mature plant that you take off and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.280 
mature plant that you take off and
you're<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:20.330> trying<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.630> turn<00:02:20.840> them<00:02:21.050> into

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you're then trying to turn them into

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.190 
you're then trying to turn them into
stem<00:02:21.860> cells<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:23.810> these<00:02:23.989> roots

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
stem cells so you can see these roots

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.740 
stem cells so you can see these roots
here<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.670> enough<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.239> reason<00:02:26.360> that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
here so it's enough the reason that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.410 
here so it's enough the reason that
substrate<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:28.190> an<00:02:28.400> artifact<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.060> me<00:02:29.209> putting

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
substrate is an artifact of me putting

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.360 
substrate is an artifact of me putting
them<00:02:29.630> on<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.900> media<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.830> kind<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.190> nice

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
them on the media so kind of a nice

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.070 
them on the media so kind of a nice
straight<00:02:31.670> line<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.090> guess<00:02:32.600> I'm<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.989> little

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
straight line I guess I'm just a little

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.690 
straight line I guess I'm just a little
worried<00:02:33.470> over<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.769> those<00:02:34.190> people<00:02:36.100> then<00:02:37.100> after

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
worried over to those people then after

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.870 
worried over to those people then after
about<00:02:38.500> two<00:02:39.500> weeks<00:02:39.530> or<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.360> those<00:02:41.360> cells<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
about two weeks or so those cells in the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.970 
about two weeks or so those cells in the
roots<00:02:43.880> will<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.390> turn<00:02:44.570> into<00:02:44.769> plant<00:02:45.769> stem

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
roots will kind of turn into plant stem

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.910 
roots will kind of turn into plant stem
cells<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:47.269> in<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.989> case<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.170> flat<00:02:48.440> biology<00:02:48.739> we

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
cells and in the case of flat biology we

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.430 
cells and in the case of flat biology we
call<00:02:49.100> these<00:02:49.280> stem<00:02:49.489> cells<00:02:49.519> cows<00:02:50.090> tissue<00:02:50.440> and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
call these stem cells cows tissue and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.370 
call these stem cells cows tissue and
that's<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.950> can<00:02:52.130> kind<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.640> see<00:02:52.880> here<00:02:53.380> I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
that's what you can kind of see here I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.590 
that's what you can kind of see here I
will<00:02:54.890> try<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.489> you<00:02:56.000> know<00:02:56.120> take<00:02:56.299> better

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
will try to you know take better

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.330 
will try to you know take better
pictures<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.380> kind<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.560> link<00:02:57.799> them<00:02:58.010> somewhere

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
pictures and kind of link them somewhere

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.580 
pictures and kind of link them somewhere
so<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.579> can<00:02:58.790> see<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.329> what<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.290> sort<00:03:00.530> of

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
so you can see but what you can sort of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.259 
so you can see but what you can sort of
see<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.130> no<00:03:01.310> longer<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.880> looks<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.239> a

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
see is that no longer it looks like a

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.479 
see is that no longer it looks like a
root<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:03.079> all<00:03:03.230> you've<00:03:03.440> got<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.769> kind<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.100> mass

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
root at all you've got this kind of mass

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.979 
root at all you've got this kind of mass
of<00:03:04.940> yellowish<00:03:05.840> whitish<00:03:06.670> colored<00:03:07.670> cells<00:03:07.989> and

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
of yellowish whitish colored cells and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.280 
of yellowish whitish colored cells and
these<00:03:09.170> are<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.739> plant<00:03:09.980> stem<00:03:10.190> cells<00:03:11.110> which<00:03:12.110> we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
these are the plant stem cells which we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.780 
these are the plant stem cells which we
can<00:03:12.440> then<00:03:12.620> do<00:03:12.920> all<00:03:13.130> sorts<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.459> interesting

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
can then do all sorts of interesting

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.600 
can then do all sorts of interesting
things<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:15.230> then<00:03:15.560> regenerate<00:03:16.130> back<00:03:16.400> out

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
things to and then regenerate back out

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.120 
things to and then regenerate back out
into<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.880> plants<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.380> again<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
into a plants and so again this is the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.520 
into a plants and so again this is the
media<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.579> has<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> mix<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.810> both<00:03:20.959> cytokinins

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
media that has a mix of both cytokinins

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.800 
media that has a mix of both cytokinins
a<00:03:21.920> toxins<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.549> that's<00:03:23.209> how<00:03:23.329> at<00:03:23.450> least<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
a toxins and that's how at least in the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.940 
a toxins and that's how at least in the
case<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.049> obnoxious<00:03:24.200> we're<00:03:24.680> getting<00:03:24.860> that

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
case of obnoxious we're getting that

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.069 
case of obnoxious we're getting that
used<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.280> regenerate<00:03:25.850> or<00:03:26.209> turn<00:03:26.630> into<00:03:26.780> stem

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
used to regenerate or turn into stem

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.150 
used to regenerate or turn into stem
cells<00:03:28.600> then<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.810> take<00:03:30.049> those<00:03:30.530> little<00:03:30.920> pieces

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
cells then you take those little pieces

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.190 
cells then you take those little pieces
of<00:03:31.280> callus<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.880> put<00:03:32.390> them<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.630> media<00:03:32.989> that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
of callus and put them on a media that

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.550 
of callus and put them on a media that
has<00:03:33.700> cytokine<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.660> no<00:03:35.810> oxen

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
has cytokine in and no oxen

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.020 
has cytokine in and no oxen
and<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:37.950> how<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:40.430> our<00:03:41.430> about<00:03:41.670> abscess

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and that's how we get our about abscess

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.630 
and that's how we get our about abscess
leaves<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.920> guy<00:03:44.130> doesn't<00:03:44.459> look<00:03:44.580> very

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
leaves so this guy doesn't look very

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760 
leaves so this guy doesn't look very
happy<00:03:45.209> that's<00:03:45.720> mainly<00:03:45.959> because<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.620> look

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
happy that's mainly because if you look

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.050 
happy that's mainly because if you look
at<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.980> plate<00:03:47.280> he<00:03:47.459> doesn't<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> whole

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
at this plate he doesn't have a whole

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.000 
at this plate he doesn't have a whole
lot<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.240> room<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> grow<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.110> know<00:03:49.260> about<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
lot of room to grow I know about you I

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.380 
lot of room to grow I know about you I
was<00:03:50.190> stuck<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.730> small<00:03:50.850> little<00:03:51.150> like

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
was stuck in a small little like

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.000 
was stuck in a small little like
container<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.410> thought<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> wouldn't

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
container like this I thought I wouldn't

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.740 
container like this I thought I wouldn't
be<00:03:53.100> very<00:03:54.830> happy<00:03:55.830> either<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.610> what<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.690> does

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
be very happy either but what this does

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.390 
be very happy either but what this does
show<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.489> our<00:03:59.489> leaves<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:00.900> grown<00:04:01.080> out

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
show you our leaves that have grown out

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.190 
show you our leaves that have grown out
so<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.700> basically<00:04:02.970> another<00:04:03.209> two<00:04:04.050> weeks

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so this is basically another two weeks

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.320 
so this is basically another two weeks
or<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.590> after<00:04:04.830> moving<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.610> callus<00:04:06.300> tissue

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
or so after moving the callus tissue

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.050 
or so after moving the callus tissue
onto<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.290> media<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:08.430> get<00:04:08.610> these<00:04:09.410> leaf

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
onto this media you get these leaf

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.509 
onto this media you get these leaf
structure<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.209> differentiating<00:04:13.280> which<00:04:14.280> i

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
structure and differentiating which i

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.530 
structure and differentiating which i
think<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.350> really<00:04:16.350> cool<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.940> then<00:04:18.120> take<00:04:18.359> it

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
think is is really cool you then take it

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.170 
think is is really cool you then take it
off<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.440> media<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.370> put<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.730> on<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.850> media

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
off of that media and put it on a media

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.290 
off of that media and put it on a media
that<00:04:21.329> has<00:04:21.530> some<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:23.100> little<00:04:23.730> bit<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.910> awesome<00:04:24.210> on

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
that has some a little bit of awesome on

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.980 
that has some a little bit of awesome on
it<00:04:24.470> and<00:04:25.470> what<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:26.070> see<00:04:26.100> here<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.690> one<00:04:27.930> is

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
it and what you can see here this one is

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.110 
it and what you can see here this one is
going<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.169> be<00:04:28.260> really<00:04:28.380> bad<00:04:28.590> I'll<00:04:29.120> definitely

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
going to be really bad I'll definitely

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.820 
going to be really bad I'll definitely
take<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.270> better<00:04:30.479> picture<00:04:30.660> this<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:31.740> you

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
take a better picture this but what you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.100 
take a better picture this but what you
can<00:04:32.010> see<00:04:32.250> here<00:04:32.280> are<00:04:32.760> these<00:04:33.450> root<00:04:33.840> tight

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
can see here are these root tight

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.700 
can see here are these root tight
structures<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:36.380> there's<00:04:37.380> another<00:04:37.410> one

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
structures here and there's another one

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.159 
structures here and there's another one
over<00:04:37.860> here<00:04:38.600> somewhere<00:04:41.270> yeah<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.540> then<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
over here somewhere yeah and then the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.480 
over here somewhere yeah and then the
other<00:04:43.290> one<00:04:43.440> kind<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.710> right<00:04:43.890> here<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.250> can<00:04:44.370> go

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
other one kind of right here you can go

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.030 
other one kind of right here you can go
to<00:04:44.550> see<00:04:44.820> again<00:04:45.810> sorry<00:04:46.320> there's<00:04:46.620> pictures<00:04:46.800> on

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
to see again sorry there's pictures on

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.320 
to see again sorry there's pictures on
all<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.310> these<00:04:47.520> aren't<00:04:47.700> all<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:47.820> great<00:04:47.970> but

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
all that these aren't all that great but

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.719 
all that these aren't all that great but
I'll<00:04:48.419> take<00:04:48.570> pictures<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.140> kind<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.380> point<00:04:49.590> out

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
I'll take pictures and kind of point out

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.180 
I'll take pictures and kind of point out
different<00:04:50.729> structures<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.860> if<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.010> leave

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
different structures and if you leave

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.219 
different structures and if you leave
them<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.490> there<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.640> little<00:04:53.789> longer<00:04:54.229> you

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
them on there a little longer you

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.790 
them on there a little longer you
actually<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:56.010> get<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:57.570> little<00:04:58.200> flower<00:04:58.410> to

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
actually can get a little flower to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.219 
actually can get a little flower to
develop<00:04:59.220> as<00:04:59.490> well<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.479> if<00:05:00.660> we<00:05:00.750> take<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.930> look<00:05:01.080> at

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
develop as well so if we take a look at

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.480 
develop as well so if we take a look at
this<00:05:01.440> one<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:03.470> these<00:05:04.470> little<00:05:05.010> structures

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
this one here these little structures

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.770 
this one here these little structures
here<00:05:06.090> are<00:05:06.840> actually<00:05:07.710> little<00:05:07.860> flowers<00:05:08.280> which

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
here are actually little flowers which

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.590 
here are actually little flowers which
kind<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.870> blows<00:05:10.110> my<00:05:10.140> mind<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.710> don't<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.600> very

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
kind of blows my mind I don't like very

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.070 
kind of blows my mind I don't like very
exciting<00:05:13.640> cool<00:05:15.650> yeah<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:18.030> is

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
exciting cool yeah so that is

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.750 
exciting cool yeah so that is
essentially<00:05:19.080> what<00:05:19.560> we<00:05:19.590> do<00:05:19.860> with<00:05:20.130> stem<00:05:20.490> cells

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
essentially what we do with stem cells

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.630 
essentially what we do with stem cells
and<00:05:20.910> plant<00:05:21.120> biology<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.919> basically<00:05:23.310> what<00:05:23.610> I

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
and plant biology and basically what I

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.300 
and plant biology and basically what I
plan<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.300> do<00:05:24.570> with<00:05:24.720> these<00:05:24.900> are<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.860> basically

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
plan to do with these are is basically

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.440 
plan to do with these are is basically
at<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.550> callow<00:05:27.030> stage<00:05:27.419> he's<00:05:29.090> he's<00:05:30.090> kind<00:05:30.300> of

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
at that callow stage he's he's kind of

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.290 
at that callow stage he's he's kind of
yellow<00:05:30.780> whitish<00:05:31.460> Maseo<00:05:32.460> cells<00:05:32.729> that's<00:05:33.120> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
yellow whitish Maseo cells that's the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.740 
yellow whitish Maseo cells that's the
point<00:05:33.450> which<00:05:33.720> we<00:05:33.960> will<00:05:34.640> insert<00:05:35.640> our<00:05:36.360> genes<00:05:36.600> of

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
point which we will insert our genes of

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.620 
point which we will insert our genes of
interest<00:05:37.400> but

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
interest but

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.480 
interest but
row<00:05:38.900> select<00:05:39.440> out<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.710> clump<00:05:39.920> of<00:05:40.040> cells<00:05:40.250> that

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
row select out the clump of cells that

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.210 
row select out the clump of cells that
were<00:05:41.300> transformed<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.080> then<00:05:42.320> regrow<00:05:43.010> whole

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
were transformed and then regrow whole

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.000 
were transformed and then regrow whole
plants<00:05:43.550> back<00:05:43.700> out<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:44.030> those<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.740> we're<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:45.950> the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
plants back out of those so we're in the

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.520 
plants back out of those so we're in the
process<00:05:46.040> right<00:05:46.460> now<00:05:46.580> of<00:05:47.350> adding<00:05:48.350> that

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
process right now of adding that

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.360 
process right now of adding that
transformation<00:05:49.340> protocol<00:05:49.820> on<00:05:49.910> top<00:05:50.120> of<00:05:50.330> this

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
transformation protocol on top of this

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.240 
transformation protocol on top of this
plant<00:05:52.370> regeneration<00:05:52.820> protocol<00:05:53.330> so<00:05:54.250> hopefully

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
plant regeneration protocol so hopefully

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.820 
plant regeneration protocol so hopefully
and<00:05:55.670> other<00:05:55.930> monks<00:05:56.930> are<00:05:57.050> still<00:05:57.200> available<00:05:57.500> to

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
and other monks are still available to

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.960 
and other monks are still available to
then<00:05:58.040> kind<00:05:58.310> of<00:05:58.340> give<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.580> another<00:05:58.760> update

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
then kind of give you another update

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.340 
then kind of give you another update
telling<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.690> that<00:05:59.780> we've<00:05:59.900> actually<00:06:00.050> done

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
telling you that we've actually done

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.800 
telling you that we've actually done
that<00:06:00.920> to<00:06:01.370> be<00:06:01.520> very<00:06:02.030> that<00:06:02.240> we've<00:06:02.420> done<00:06:02.540> that<00:06:02.660> as

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
that to be very that we've done that as
