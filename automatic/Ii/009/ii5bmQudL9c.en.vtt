00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello today his 6 year old daughter as we are going to make it a pot-au-feu 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.820
 at the port 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.650
 my way 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.240
 so Thursday at the port because I basically only have pork 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:13.869
 to do this 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.999
 we know sausage 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.210
 famous sausage if you can recognize smoked sausage 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.670
 suspect 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.470
 this is the sausage of Toulouse 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.539
 a Japanese 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.659
 slightly salted 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.659
 supports 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 the cabbage 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.350
 a little cabbage 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.510
 potatoes 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.510
 bouquet garni 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.300
 I am in mourning 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.860
 and leeks 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 the case 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.260
 branch series 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.280
 carrots 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 I'm getting used to a little bit of Espelette pepper 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 cubes of chicken broth 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.870
 it's a pretty simple preparation 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.390
 but very long in power 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.500
 to know that it is a dish that brings together 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.820
 reportage 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.530
 a dish of boiled meat 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.330
 and it is he who 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.780
 so the first thing it will be as soon as I'm in addition to its ports as well as 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.210
 the hock because it only requires a long cooking 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 why I put pork feet 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.090
 in the background obviously 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.240
 and then I'm going to put the hocks then look at me this beautiful jared 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.170
 and I have 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.640
 I'm going to wet 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.720
 I put water 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.520
 and I will start to cook 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 so here I am going to start bringing to a boil 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.780
 as we can see it's anne who we can cold start 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.080
 moreover, it's three quarters of their calculations 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.010
 a quivering and covered 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.470
 but m you can replace it with pork you can replace height 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.220
 and that man 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.040
 photo cl 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 the scoter 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.690
 with bone marrow 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.430
 visitors 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.979
 in what will it be able to add 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.249
 the vegetables 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.249
 obviously 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.379
 the man of theater 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.379
 carrots 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.319
 theoretically an opponent put 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.209
 sewing on 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.089
 for me my recipe 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.009
 it's seamless 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.009
 but the day before 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 celery branch 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:43.950
 do not forget 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.889
 the bouquet garni 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 made from white rice bread 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.719
 the gendarmes 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.719
 Very important 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 I can tell you it's a real treat look at it 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.839
 thereafter I will add bottom of the water the bottom of poultry we could 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.649
 of poultry have occupied 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.729
 we can go from chicken broth 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.769
 and I hear myself 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.769
 look at that color 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.199
 win it all to boiling not so I'll add a little bit 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.199
 a little bit of Espelette pepper 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.549
 so a little bit more Espelette pepper 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.709
 no more because after it's a little too strong 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.759
 theoretically in the real recipe quite patrick loon espelette export 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.889
 in large 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.359
 so there is a little bit of psychic pregnancy 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.849
 be careful because 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.209
 the knowledgeable sector 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.079
 these real cats dogs 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.040
 in 2007 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.980
 and what port in 2016 so it's true that it has a little bit its line 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.980
 of signal 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.019
 but percent if you do it with the end tube with the scoter the egypt and 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.079
 alassane ouattara 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.079
 they add a little bit of concerts 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.819
 look at those vegetables that are simmering 20 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.089
 at the moment 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.019
 what you were harinordoquy is clearing 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.409
 without super good 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.499
 I'm cooking 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.499
 but now I'll be able to start putting sausages 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.919
 the vegetables are almost cooked 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.029
 I had sausages 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.059
 so the meat is simmering i can tell you lo hershey 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.229
 Manificat 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.229
 so take mostly smoked sausages 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.439
 to decorate 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.449
 all areas to sausages and then once I'm happy you're feeling 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.029
 blade 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:45.249
 the meat 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
 but TV and morning you get your studies 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.759
 paul bouillon 3 and then after the broth can recover it to put 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.680
 in soup 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.430
 high school students 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.949
 I can tell you 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.080
 why do they behave resignation earlier at table thrill I put 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.909
 covered 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.360
 and I will let close this site 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.249
 so look at me these sausages which are then 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.249
 so I'm going to be able to take my life in mourning 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.559
 separate vegetables 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.710
 not just broth next door and then there's more than just serving and 

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:23.319
 clermont 6 e all of this of course because it is eaten super super hot 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.610
 and you can eat and drink that with a grain to grind a beautiful sun I 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.999
 see also meat 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.749
 cooked sausages 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.870
 the kill port and then and the hock 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.789
 the vegetables 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.919
 and I can show you for this little juice it is beautiful 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.419
 so germany 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.509
 and smells that are scented 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.509
 you mix with them vermicelli pupils 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.030
 so you have to be done and now finish on cooking tip
