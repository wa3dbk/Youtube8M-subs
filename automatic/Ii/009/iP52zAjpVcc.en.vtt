of it I reckon these are the best then I

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.290 
of it I reckon these are the best then I
got<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.630> wooden<00:02:13.080> block<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:14.880> 1<00:02:15.030> 2<00:02:15.060> 3

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
got this wooden block so there are 1 2 3

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.120 
got this wooden block so there are 1 2 3
6<00:02:16.050> blocks<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.650> wood<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.670> are<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.980> we

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
6 blocks of wood here that are that we

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.500 
6 blocks of wood here that are that we
use<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.760> make<00:02:20.940> stand<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.620> are<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.040> chisels

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
use to make stand here are the chisels

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.199 
use to make stand here are the chisels
so<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:28.740> can<00:02:29.040> carve<00:02:29.280> them<00:02:29.459> into<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.820> piece<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
so we can carve them into the piece of

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.199 
so we can carve them into the piece of
wood<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.950> put<00:02:32.310> paint<00:02:33.090> on

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
