00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.529 

okay<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> lead<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.909> first<00:02:00.180> need<00:02:00.360> is

okay now the lead the first need is
right<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.600> high

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
right here it's on it's on the high

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.520 
right here it's on it's on the high
eight<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.759> g-string

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
eight on the g-string

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.059 
eight on the g-string
it's<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.950> fifths<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
it's right here so it's a fifths of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's right here so it's a fifths of
ninth<00:02:11.400> fret<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.209> eleventh<00:02:12.900> fret<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> G

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
ninth fret and eleventh fret on the G

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.550 
ninth fret and eleventh fret on the G
and<00:02:13.620> indeed<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.989> use<00:02:15.989> my<00:02:16.110> little<00:02:16.260> finger<00:02:16.380> here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and indeed I use my little finger here

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
and indeed I use my little finger here
then<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.069> goes<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> B<00:02:17.519> string<00:02:17.580> twelfth

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
then it goes to the B string twelfth

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:35.460 
then it goes to the B string twelfth
fret<00:02:22.640> because<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.849> four<00:02:24.030> times<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.420> first<00:02:24.630> one

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.090 

I<00:02:37.270> guess

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.680 

you<00:02:45.100> don't<00:02:45.250> happy<00:02:45.520> though<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.330> does<00:02:46.480> for

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you don't happy though so it does for

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.270 
you don't happy though so it does for
those<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.230> now<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.530> turns<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> snappy

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
those and now it turns to the snappy

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.820 
those and now it turns to the snappy
part<00:02:48.490> for<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.670> bass<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:50.110> goes<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.620> kind<00:02:50.800> of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
part for the bass it goes it's kind of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.000 
part for the bass it goes it's kind of
like<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.160> hillbilly<00:02:51.370> pickles

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.489 

knockos

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:07.499 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.660 

then<00:03:08.499> back<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.950> beginning<00:03:09.340> again<00:03:09.370> two

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
then back to the beginning again two
