00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.990
 not used he will cook it like 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.840
 then probably when sol is done here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.320

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.960

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.150
 Well, we do not say sake but I do not know how 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.040
 right i think that sake 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.080
 Here in general, here is such here today 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.360
 dishes well let's see what it is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.250
 will end when scaffolding stay with 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.500
 we are going to prepare as guys 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.370
 something completely altogether incredible cousin 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.340
 the form of how many pots and pans lump 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 yes this water pot still this 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 that's how brazier yes how i said it all 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.230
 fueled i don't know any concept at all 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.390
 why not know all this now 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.850
 something will be 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.550
 there is still scary to happen and so guys 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.390
 But on this 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.740
 does not mean fried current but there 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.640
 our noodles are already starting to happen here 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.190
 the frying pan and while I am warming up I do not know 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.680
 how many sketches well, I think that probably 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.530
 not very long 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.940
 of course I was cooking no reason because 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.370
 that too much smoke 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.500
 harry smells and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.690
 and butter and in general I think that this 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.099
 first last time because i'm looking 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:33.069
 on it and the silent horror of how it all 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:37.709
 it smells and how it all squirts so on 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:43.780
 pan went garlic I look back 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:48.069
 while confusing roast roast what is not 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.370
 says that there is a simple nose 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.510
 said that there will be no i think 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:01.269
 husband try not so here it is garlic 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.230
 and Benji Ava now there I look 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.230
 shrimp will go 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.780
 the price everyone will show it like this we fry 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.780
 when wash fit, I'll show you 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.010
 so inclined here too connected in 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.419
 general preparation of this wonderful 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:33.030
 dish turns hand here is on 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:36.030
 there should be a juice of this color 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.410
 all cost all of this we get 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:45.510
 let's see another experiment with us 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:49.620
 of the flow and so we fry right over here 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.250
 shrimp and such as welded can 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.880
 say noodles add this here too 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.539
 in this griddle with shrimp and details 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.430
 where we did not stand and now this 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.289
 saw yes here he added this 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.360
 sauce now I'll show you what it is 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.610
 the sauce is some kind of special thai 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.740
 the sauce here and so it looks like it means we 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.599
 we buy him here we have 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.690
 not so far there is quite a plant with us 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.389
 there is a Thai shop there 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.639
 chinese japanese products general and 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.190
 I know who the hosts food mannered Chinese 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.990
 just the owners but they have all sorts of them 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.539
 eat the products here it is 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.250
 Thai sauce 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:38.110
 what is written in thailand 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.460
 Ingredients such well, of course, not really 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:45.069
 you can read the most useful here 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.409
 but as they say that it is better Tipo 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:52.110
 Tipo everything is fine but once you can 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:06:00.159
 so eat, I think that 's the way 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:03.669
 It costs 459 to the camera that does not focus 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.289
 in what 459 he stands such a secret like 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.599
 as my husband said it was such 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:14.889
 real real thai some kind of there 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:17.650
 word urgent look and so guys here 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.139
 what we ended up with in 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.880
 general after all the bullets my husband kicked out 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.880
 burning go now don't bother me here under 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.490

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.840

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.590
 and the cheese was already fried and here in 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.199

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.419
 here is mixed and in general, here and so here it is 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.060
