00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
hopefully the series will continue as

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.050 
hopefully the series will continue as
normal<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:32.010> will<00:02:32.160> finally<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:32.880> able<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
normal and we will finally be able to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.190 
normal and we will finally be able to
get<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.210> map<00:02:33.390> done<00:02:33.600> we've<00:02:33.840> already<00:02:34.020> got

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
get this map done we've already got

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.170 
get this map done we've already got
begin<00:02:34.710> if<00:02:35.070> you've<00:02:35.220> seen<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:35.820> six<00:02:36.030> badges

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
begin if you've seen we got six badges

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.440 
begin if you've seen we got six badges
on<00:02:37.110> 2<00:02:37.620> 3<00:02:37.980> 4<00:02:38.340> 46<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.820> need<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.270> badges

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
on 2 3 4 46 we need two more badges

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 
on 2 3 4 46 we need two more badges
which<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.290> hopefully<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.830> soon<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.340> then

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
which will hopefully get soon and then

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.870 
which will hopefully get soon and then
we<00:02:41.820> got<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> puck<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.870> leaks<00:02:43.350> etc<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.040> then

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
we got the puck on leaks etc and then

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.130 
we got the puck on leaks etc and then
that'll<00:02:45.209> be<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.330> end<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.510> series<00:02:45.690> worth<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that'll be the end of series worth to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.180 
that'll be the end of series worth to
find<00:02:46.290> someone<00:02:46.440> else<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:46.860> then

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
find someone else to do and then

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.400 
find someone else to do and then
hopefully<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.850> macro<00:02:48.360> will<00:02:48.600> make<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.959> new<00:02:49.230> map

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
hopefully the macro will make a new map

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.460 
hopefully the macro will make a new map
or<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:50.220> will<00:02:50.370> rejoin<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> map<00:02:51.360> when<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.959> Kanto

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
or we will rejoin the map when the Kanto

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.890 
or we will rejoin the map when the Kanto
region<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.920> added<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> goes<00:02:54.780> from

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
region is added and see how it goes from

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.680 
region is added and see how it goes from
there<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.200> yeah<00:02:55.350> I'm<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.580> Java<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:57.540> I
