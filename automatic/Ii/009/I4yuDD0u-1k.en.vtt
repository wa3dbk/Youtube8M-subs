for and this ring was about the same
depth<00:00:40.969> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> sand<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.780> Southern

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
depth this is sand in Southern

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.770 
depth this is sand in Southern
California<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.820> happened<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.570> we

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
California so what happened is as we

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.389 
California so what happened is as we
approach<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.649> ahead<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:46.920> approach<00:00:47.129> with

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
approach to go ahead and approach with

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.729 
approach to go ahead and approach with
the<00:00:47.550> Explorer<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.899> Explorers<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the Explorer the Explorers kind of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.049 
the Explorer the Explorers kind of
jumping<00:00:50.070> around<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.890> as<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.250> sweep<00:00:53.610> over

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
jumping around and as you sweep over

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.439 
jumping around and as you sweep over
what<00:00:54.300> happened<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:56.579> seems<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.210> when

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
what happened was it seems like when

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.760 
what happened was it seems like when
you're<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.750> area<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> lot<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> trash

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you're in an area with a lot of trash

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
you're in an area with a lot of trash
and<00:00:59.039> targets<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.760> doesn't<00:01:00.180> recover<00:01:00.510> quick

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and targets it doesn't recover quick

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
and targets it doesn't recover quick
enough<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.590> glides<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.219> over<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
enough it just glides right over that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
enough it just glides right over that
ring<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:04.129> now<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
ring as if it's not there now if you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
ring as if it's not there now if you
slow<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> put<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.869> pinpoint

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
slow down a bit and put it in pinpoint

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
slow down a bit and put it in pinpoint
mode<00:01:09.890> then<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:12.030> really

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
mode then you start to go over really

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
mode then you start to go over really
slow<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.170> baby<00:01:13.350> circles<00:01:13.830> you'll<00:01:14.040> find

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
slow in little baby circles you'll find

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.440 
slow in little baby circles you'll find
it<00:01:15.710> now<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> Excalibur<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it now with the Excalibur which is the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.749 
it now with the Excalibur which is the
one<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> found<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.920> didn't<00:01:20.310> seem<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
one that found it it didn't seem to have

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.270 
one that found it it didn't seem to have
that<00:01:20.939> problem<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:22.500> found<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> was

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that problem it found it when it was

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
that problem it found it when it was
sweeping<00:01:23.759> over<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.540> apparent

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
sweeping over it was really apparent

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.850 
sweeping over it was really apparent
that<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.340> silver<00:01:26.340> ring<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.860> whereas

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that that silver ring was there whereas

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
that that silver ring was there whereas
with<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.670> some<00:01:29.880> reason<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> big<00:01:36.030> big

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
with for some reason this is a big big

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.550 
with for some reason this is a big big
area<00:01:36.799> with<00:01:37.799> fire<00:01:38.070> pits<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.850> forth<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.560> we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
area with fire pits and so forth that we

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.260 
area with fire pits and so forth that we
are<00:01:40.650> looking<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.310> lost<00:01:41.579> ring<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:44.270> we've

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
are looking for this lost ring and we've

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
are looking for this lost ring and we've
been<00:01:45.450> over<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.750> area<00:01:45.990> twice<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.159> missed

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
been over this area twice so we missed

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
been over this area twice so we missed
that<00:01:47.430> ring<00:01:47.729> twice<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> Explorer<00:01:48.930> se

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that ring twice with the Explorer se

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.319 
that ring twice with the Explorer se
today's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> first<00:01:50.759> day<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.090> Excalibur<00:01:51.780> out

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
today's the first day with Excalibur out

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.609 
today's the first day with Excalibur out
so<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:54.780> seems<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
so it really seems like with the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
so it really seems like with the
Excalibur<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.790> haven't<00:01:57.030> spent<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> time

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Excalibur we haven't spent a lot of time

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.830 
Excalibur we haven't spent a lot of time
with<00:01:58.460> Explorer<00:01:59.460> se<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.060> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.360> new<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.750> us

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
with Explorer se it's kind of new for us

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.190 
with Explorer se it's kind of new for us
but<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.070> seems<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
but it really seems like you have to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
but it really seems like you have to
take<00:02:04.380> baby<00:02:04.619> steps<00:02:04.799> especially<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> high

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
take baby steps especially in a high

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
take baby steps especially in a high
trash<00:02:06.329> area<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.680> detecting<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> lot

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
trash area because it's detecting a lot

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.979 
trash area because it's detecting a lot
of<00:02:08.550> stuff<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.509> pinpoint

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
of stuff you got to put it in pinpoint

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
of stuff you got to put it in pinpoint
mode<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.849> really<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.030> over<00:02:12.180> every<00:02:12.450> single

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
mode and really go over every single

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.460 
mode and really go over every single
little<00:02:13.020> tart

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
little tart

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
little tart
to<00:02:13.710> see<00:02:13.920> what<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.970> said<00:02:15.240> we

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
to see what it is but like I said we

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.290 
to see what it is but like I said we
glided<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:16.230> past<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.880> silver<00:02:17.880> ring<00:02:18.090> only

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
glided right past that silver ring only

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.470 
glided right past that silver ring only
four<00:02:18.690> inches<00:02:18.870> down<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:20.220> easy<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.820> mean<00:02:21.330> as

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
four inches down really easy I mean as

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.840 
four inches down really easy I mean as
if<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> weren't<00:02:22.020> even<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.500> which<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.640> kind

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
if it weren't even there which is kind

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.020 
if it weren't even there which is kind
of<00:02:23.880> scary<00:02:24.060> because<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.730> thing

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
of scary because you think that thing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.630 
of scary because you think that thing
should<00:02:27.240> stick<00:02:27.630> out<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.960> really<00:02:28.230> show<00:02:28.640> just

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
should stick out and really show just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.480 
should stick out and really show just
pop<00:02:29.910> right<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:31.590> loud<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:31.890> clear

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
pop right out at you be loud and clear

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.210 
pop right out at you be loud and clear
being<00:02:32.940> only<00:02:33.060> four<00:02:33.420> inches<00:02:33.570> down<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:35.040> did<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
being only four inches down we did a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.700 
being only four inches down we did a
similar<00:02:35.550> demo<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> tungsten<00:02:36.780> ring<00:02:37.260> and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
similar demo with a tungsten ring and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.980 
similar demo with a tungsten ring and
for<00:02:38.580> some<00:02:38.760> reason<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> tungsten<00:02:39.390> seemed<00:02:39.870> to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
for some reason the tungsten seemed to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.560 
for some reason the tungsten seemed to
be<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.560> louder<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
be a little bit louder and and the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.650 
be a little bit louder and and the
Explorer<00:02:43.440> seemed<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.970> ring<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Explorer seemed to like that ring a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.900 
Explorer seemed to like that ring a
little<00:02:45.959> bit<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.280> said<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.700> went

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
little bit more but like I said we went

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
little bit more but like I said we went
over<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.510> couple<00:02:49.140> times<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.650> didn't<00:02:49.860> see

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
over this a couple times and didn't see

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
over this a couple times and didn't see
it<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:50.520> once<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.940> found<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.330> we've<00:02:51.450> gone

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it and then once we found it we've gone

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.930 
it and then once we found it we've gone
over<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:52.020> three<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:52.830> four<00:02:52.920> times<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.760> see

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
over it three or four times just to see

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.370 
over it three or four times just to see
what<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.209> does<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:56.370> misses<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
what it does and it misses it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.400 
what it does and it misses it
unfortunately<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.360> anyway<00:03:00.360> maybe<00:03:01.200> there's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
unfortunately so anyway maybe there's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.810 
unfortunately so anyway maybe there's
someone<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.740> there<00:03:01.980> who's<00:03:02.160> got<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> lot<00:03:02.760> of

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
someone out there who's got a lot of

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.940 
someone out there who's got a lot of
time<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.510> detector<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.380> give

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
time with this detector and can give

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.330 
time with this detector and can give
some<00:03:05.160> insight<00:03:05.490> on<00:03:05.520> why<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:07.340> it's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
some insight on why that is but it's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.730 
some insight on why that is but it's
kind<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.550> disappointing<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.470> we'd<00:03:10.470> go<00:03:10.650> over

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
kind of disappointing that we'd go over

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.230 
kind of disappointing that we'd go over
this<00:03:10.860> whole<00:03:11.070> area<00:03:11.100> with<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> detector<00:03:12.120> with

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
this whole area with the detector with

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.970 
this whole area with the detector with
all<00:03:12.390> these<00:03:12.540> multi<00:03:12.930> frequencies<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.740> missed

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
all these multi frequencies and missed

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.610 
all these multi frequencies and missed
that<00:03:14.190> ring<00:03:14.490> only<00:03:14.790> four<00:03:15.060> inches<00:03:15.209> down<00:03:15.620> so

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that ring only four inches down so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.080 
that ring only four inches down so
anyway<00:03:17.370> that's<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.900> am
