00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to you all again for play since 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.830
 i'm a bit tired of writing fan fiction i 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.410
 decided to do something more interesting 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.599
 Yes, I know that the stuffing for this Freddie 4 is still 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 did not come out but nevertheless I decided 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 record your own guard calls in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.369
 these calls, I will try not to write 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 five plot details for this hadis 4 then 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.710
 I will not describe the scene 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.990
 and story time activities for 4 fnafa 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 At least I think it will not be superfluous 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.500
 would dream of what might be five on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.149
 this frodi s4 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 okay put more likes and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.620
 the rest of the calls will be out soon and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 I will tell the future for dull 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.090
 the guard listened to the recording they called him 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 They called the guard they dude 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:52.559
 the recording of which he listened okay 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 let's start hey hello since my 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 the job is to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 tell new employees about their 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.399
 work and also talk about the rules 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 behavior in this place then i do 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 I write down for you this message which 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.409
 you will probably hear the next day 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.110
 after i write it okay 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's get to the point in short your job 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 not so heavy watch all that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 happening in this place 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 especially not here for nothing 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.409
 happening at least interesting 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 before animatronics you try not 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.689
 pay attention to them of course not 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.060
 scary but somehow this part 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.000
 this institution at least they 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 merely brainless robots in whose 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.700
 heads alone wires yes even if they 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.659
 were alive then I would have already put in my pants 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.430
 out of fear 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 in short except for its external 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.439
 they don't threaten you well 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.439
 okay let's go over the rules which 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.870
 help someone later please 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.620

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.620
 doing it no 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.709
 if I am not mistaken 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.360
 one of those who have black pens and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.370
 getting closer on flying but not brunettes 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.060
 unfree of all the flowers and worth it 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.060
 make sure 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.349

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.269

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.480
