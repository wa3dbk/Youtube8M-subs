the<00:00:39.600> key<00:00:39.900> is<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> mulch

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
the key is you want to get a mulch

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.580 
the key is you want to get a mulch
that's<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> bark<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.240> the<00:00:42.330> tree<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:43.350> not

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that's the bark of the tree it's not

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
that's the bark of the tree it's not
just<00:00:43.860> basically<00:00:44.280> woodchips<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.210> been

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
just basically woodchips that have been

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680 
just basically woodchips that have been
reground<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:45.990> read<00:00:46.140> I'd<00:00:47.150> make<00:00:48.150> sure<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.510> take

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
reground and read I'd make sure you take

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
reground and read I'd make sure you take
a<00:00:48.720> look<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.200> mulch<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.040> believe

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
a look at the mulch don't just believe

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
a look at the mulch don't just believe
the<00:00:50.430> person<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.760> talk<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.239> phone<00:00:51.450> look

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the person you talk to on the phone look

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.570 
the person you talk to on the phone look
at<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.470> mulch<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.950> make<00:00:53.160> sure<00:00:53.370> you're

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
at the mulch and make sure you're

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.430 
at the mulch and make sure you're
looking<00:00:53.880> at<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> bark<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> tree<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
looking at the bark of the tree the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
looking at the bark of the tree the
reason<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> bark<00:00:56.370> mulch<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.120> if

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
reason I like the bark mulch is is if

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
reason I like the bark mulch is is if
you've<00:00:57.720> ever<00:00:57.870> seen<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:59.239> mulches<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> are

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you've ever seen the mulches that are

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.780 
you've ever seen the mulches that are
basically<00:01:00.840> woodchips<00:01:01.410> reground<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.460> then

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
basically woodchips reground and then

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.420 
basically woodchips reground and then
died<00:01:03.199> quite<00:01:04.199> often<00:01:04.410> that<00:01:04.710> mulch<00:01:04.979> gets<00:01:05.250> very

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
died quite often that mulch gets very

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.450 
died quite often that mulch gets very
matted<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.060> after<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.509> season<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.340> when<00:01:08.340> it's

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
matted down after a season and when it's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700 
matted down after a season and when it's
so<00:01:08.640> matted<00:01:09.030> down<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.540> water<00:01:09.780> basically<00:01:10.350> rolls

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so matted down the water basically rolls

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
so matted down the water basically rolls
off<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:12.150> bark<00:01:12.420> mulches

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
off of it well bark mulches

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.990 
off of it well bark mulches
do<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.470> matted<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.759> nearly

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
do get matted down they don't get nearly

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
do get matted down they don't get nearly
as<00:01:15.119> tightly<00:01:15.420> matted<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> come

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
as tightly matted down so you can come

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
as tightly matted down so you can come
through<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> tool<00:01:17.729> called<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.060> garden

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
through with a tool called the garden

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.389 
through with a tool called the garden
weasel<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.899> loosen<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> mulch<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> let<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
weasel and loosen the mulch and let that

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.570 
weasel and loosen the mulch and let that
air<00:01:20.670> work<00:01:21.060> its<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.390> through<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:23.100> break<00:01:23.340> down<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
air work its way through to break down a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
air work its way through to break down a
mulch<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.270> bacteria<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.050> soil<00:01:25.259> actually

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
mulch the bacteria in the soil actually

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.790 
mulch the bacteria in the soil actually
use<00:01:26.190> nitrogen<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.869> bark<00:01:28.410> mulches

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
use nitrogen and because bark mulches

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.469 
use nitrogen and because bark mulches
are<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> light<00:01:29.340> they're<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.180> less

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
are so light they're going to take less

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
are so light they're going to take less
nitrogen<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> soil<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.770> break<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.190> down

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
nitrogen from the soil to break it down

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
nitrogen from the soil to break it down
as<00:01:32.700> opposed<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.660> heavier<00:01:34.020> wood<00:01:34.500> mulches

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
as opposed to the heavier wood mulches

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.399 
as opposed to the heavier wood mulches
I'm<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:36.060> big<00:01:36.299> fan<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.570> hemlock<00:01:37.170> bark

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I'm a very big fan of hemlock bark

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
I'm a very big fan of hemlock bark
mulches<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.370> also<00:01:38.520> pine<00:01:38.970> spruce

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
mulches and there's also pine spruce

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
mulches and there's also pine spruce

and take a look at it you're going to be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
and take a look at it you're going to be
seeing<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> bark<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> tree<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:47.570> there's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
seeing the bark of the tree and there's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
seeing the bark of the tree and there's
always<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.500> wood<00:01:49.740> fibers<00:01:50.190> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
always going to be some wood fibers in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
always going to be some wood fibers in
there<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> key<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.570> bark

insects in my mulches but if you want

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.490 
insects in my mulches but if you want
that<00:01:58.890> extra<00:01:59.100> measure<00:01:59.400> of<00:01:59.640> protection<00:01:59.820> I

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
recommend you take a look at cedar bark

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
recommend you take a look at cedar bark
mulch<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.650> cedar<00:02:04.950> bark<00:02:05.220> mulch<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.580> going<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
mulch your cedar bark mulch is going to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.730 
mulch your cedar bark mulch is going to
have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> nice<00:02:06.090> golden<00:02:06.330> color<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.229> it's

going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> matte<00:02:08.190> down<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> little<00:02:08.790> bit<00:02:08.940> more

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
going to matte down a little bit more

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
going to matte down a little bit more
than<00:02:09.360> your<00:02:09.479> regular<00:02:09.660> bark<00:02:10.110> mulches<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.340> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
than your regular bark mulches but it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.330 
than your regular bark mulches but it's
a<00:02:11.549> very<00:02:11.670> beautiful<00:02:11.880> mulch<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.310> a

very<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:25.110> fine<00:02:25.560> mulches<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> look<00:02:27.600> at

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
very very fine mulches I take a look at

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.990 
very very fine mulches I take a look at
those<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.769> only<00:02:28.980> issue<00:02:29.250> I've<00:02:29.459> seen<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.850> some

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
those the only issue I've seen with some

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.759 
those the only issue I've seen with some
of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> peat<00:02:30.329> mulches<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.019> if<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> full

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
of the peat mulches is if it's in a full

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.620 
of the peat mulches is if it's in a full
Sun<00:02:32.010> bed<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.060> don't<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
Sun bed and you don't have a really

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.630 
Sun bed and you don't have a really
thick<00:02:33.989> cover<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.739> you'll<00:02:35.370> end<00:02:35.549> up

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
thick cover on there you'll end up

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
thick cover on there you'll end up
getting<00:02:35.910> weeds<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.480> grow<00:02:36.720> very<00:02:36.959> quickly

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
getting weeds that grow very quickly

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.860 
getting weeds that grow very quickly
because<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.650> such<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> good<00:02:38.070> mulch<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.239> if

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
because it's such a good mulch so if

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
because it's such a good mulch so if
you're<00:02:40.230> using<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> peat<00:02:41.010> mulches<00:02:41.489> I'd

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you're using one of the peat mulches I'd

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.000 
you're using one of the peat mulches I'd
say<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.510> lot<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> perennials<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
say if it's a lot of perennials it's a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.290 
say if it's a lot of perennials it's a
great<00:02:44.220> choice

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
great choice

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
great choice
for<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.570> bed<00:02:45.810> where<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.200> wide<00:02:46.560> open<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
for a bed where it's wide open like this

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520 
for a bed where it's wide open like this
I<00:02:47.520> probably<00:02:48.030> would<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.690> use<00:02:48.990> one<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> peek

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I probably would not use one of the peek

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.440 
I probably would not use one of the peek
mulches
