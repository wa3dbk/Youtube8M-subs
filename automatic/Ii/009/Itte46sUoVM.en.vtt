 comment with you on another issue of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.250
 math test of the public tender 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.969
 Military Police of the state are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.799
 Paulo 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.490
 this test was performed at the end of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.380
 2014 was the responsibility of vunesp and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 of the vunesp foundation and was for the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.689
 soldier of 2nd class and I ask that you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.760
 Take a look at a link I'm going to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 leave the description of this video that the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 link will take you to a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 Postiga I recommend to you that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 is studying for this contest and wants 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 to succeed is an elaborate handout 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 carefully for who is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 studying for the police contest 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 military of the state of são paulo was made 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.700
 for who has a lot of tradition in contest 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 public and therefore knows what is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.550
 Ok it's doing good. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 worth checking do not forget to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 visit the question that we are going 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.899
 discuss the issue of number 27 today 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.780
 proof that the following has been 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.059
 a survey was carried out with 240 people to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 know the number of times they have lunch 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.890
 in restaurants during the week to 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.170
 table shows the results obtained 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.930
 the graph representing the values ​​of the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.760
 percentage table is and I do not 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 I put the graphics here because I never 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.140
 would come here in this space we 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 do the percentage calculation and then I 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 I 'll show you which chart to choose 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.560
 correct alternative is good 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.939
 is the table says the following number of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.650
 people that the girl that yours is not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.159
 so here we are the number of times 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 in 0 times how many people 36 people 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450
 36 people answered that they did not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.049
 lunch outside does not like in restaurant nor 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 A day in the week is good, so we 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.689
 will calculate this percentage increase of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 which form without 100% is for the number 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.600
 total of 240 people as well as x 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.729
 stands for 36 are quantities directly 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 Proportions ok so I can do 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.219
 that way I can make a rule of 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.829
 three 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.170
 and I can cancel 10 from above with 10 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.780
 here from below it will stay until about 24 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.489
 and then I'll multiply cross 24 times 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.009
 x 1024 x and 10 months and 36 360 to find 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.569
 the value of x simply passes 24 dividing 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.019
 so x biguá 360 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.639
 per 24 x Biguá 15 then 15% of the 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.609
 respondents answered that they did not have lunch 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:25.689
 outside once a week 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.469
 I'm sorry, and it's the number of 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.090
 people 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.519
 percentage is the number of people 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.010
 who replied that they had lunch outside a 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.709
 Only once a week will we do the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.459
 Next about 100 240 and about gouache 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.519
 180 again cancer 10 from above with 10 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.969
 from below multiplies in cross 24 x is equal 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.760
 and 80 to find the value of x 24 step 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:54.099
 dividing 1,080 / 24 equals 45 x 45 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.109
 To find this one, they answered. 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.099
 who has lunch twice a week 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:04.629
 without over 240 and gouache on 84 cancel 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:11.019
 10 50 low 24 times x is equal to 84 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:14.109
 times 1024 x 1 840 x and 840/24 logo x 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.299
 biguá 35 and lastly they answered 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.120
 who lunches out three or more times for 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.840
 week are twelve people are without being 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.090
 for 245 x is for 12 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.560
 then cancer 10 and multiply cross 24 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.129
 x equation 120 ten times 12 steps if the 24 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.859
 dividing x equaçu 120/24 logo x 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.299
 Iguaçu so then those values 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.159
 percentages that I can put here 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.560
 to answer what is the ball that does not eat 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.549
 off no day 15 percent 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.859
 eat lunch only once a week 45% 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.579
 eat lunch twice a week 35 per 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.620
 cent 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.799
 have lunch three or more times 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.959
 week 5% and analyzing the graphs 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.120
 graph I found is the graph of 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.729
 Alternatively you can check with absolute 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.120
 sure of the great values ​​that 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:06.280
 I found it here 15 45 35 and 53 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.439
 That's when I sincerely hope that you 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.879
 have tanned but this video lesson and 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.799
 I promise to come back soon with other 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.909
 issues resolved and commented on 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.909
 you a hug and see you there
