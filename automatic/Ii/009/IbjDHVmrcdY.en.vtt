spray just a little bit to make kind of
like<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.819> transition<00:02:26.569> here<00:02:27.280> towards<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> edge

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
like a transition here towards the edge

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.379 
like a transition here towards the edge
later<00:02:29.090> towards<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.840> edge<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:31.189> just<00:02:31.459> blend<00:02:32.239> it

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:32.389 
later towards the edge and just blend it

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:38.440 
later towards the edge and just blend it
into<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.719> darker<00:02:33.290> area<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.340> then<00:02:38.209> just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
into the darker area and then just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.390 
into the darker area and then just
really<00:02:38.719> use<00:02:39.079> what's<00:02:39.319> left<00:02:39.560> over<00:02:39.769> on<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.129> paper

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
really use what's left over on the paper

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.770 
really use what's left over on the paper
what's<00:02:40.790> left<00:02:41.060> over<00:02:41.299> on<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.659> copy<00:02:43.480> all<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.659> way

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
what's left over on the copy all the way

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.539 
what's left over on the copy all the way
out<00:02:44.959> towards<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.709> edge<00:02:45.829> somebody<00:02:46.430> on

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
out towards the edge somebody on

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.420 
out towards the edge somebody on
Facebook<00:02:46.700> asked<00:02:47.359> me<00:02:47.480> how<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.980> make<00:02:49.219> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
Facebook asked me how you you make that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.339 
Facebook asked me how you you make that
transition<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.239> started<00:02:50.599> in<00:02:50.750> one<00:02:50.930> area<00:02:51.169> and

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
transition so it started in one area and

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.979 
transition so it started in one area and
later<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.040> another<00:02:52.159> area<00:02:52.569> I'm<00:02:53.569> doing<00:02:53.870> this

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
later in another area I'm doing this

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.830 
later in another area I'm doing this
fairly<00:02:54.349> quickly<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.889> but<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.430> think<00:02:55.489> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
fairly quickly here but I think you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.699 
fairly quickly here but I think you
totally<00:02:56.840> get<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.230> idea

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
totally get the idea

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.640 
totally get the idea
scrape<00:02:58.250> more<00:02:58.519> here<00:02:58.819> darker<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.780> then<00:03:00.260> blend

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
scrape more here darker and then blend

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.979 
scrape more here darker and then blend
it<00:03:00.799> towards<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.489> edge<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.939> then<00:03:02.449> only<00:03:02.719> use

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
it towards the edge and then only use

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.860 
it towards the edge and then only use
what's<00:03:03.290> left<00:03:03.349> on<00:03:03.829> your<00:03:03.980> cotton<00:03:04.870> another

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
technique that I really make with these

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.330 
technique that I really make with these
testicles<00:03:08.719> is<00:03:11.049> blending<00:03:12.049> blending<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:13.040> couple

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
that's great and then I can use a q-tip

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.330 
that's great and then I can use a q-tip
as<00:05:04.830> well

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
as well

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.180 
as well
and<00:05:06.060> get<00:05:06.360> into<00:05:06.570> these<00:05:06.930> areas<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:08.039> like

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
and get into these areas that are like

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.510 
and get into these areas that are like
close<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:09.030> what<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.389> have<00:05:09.810> already<00:05:09.990> color

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
close to what I have already color

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.330 
close to what I have already color
that<00:05:12.330> takes<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.900> long<00:05:13.199> time<00:05:13.229> -<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.830> can<00:05:14.160> also

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
that takes a long time - I can also

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.300 
that takes a long time - I can also
scrape<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.330> little<00:05:16.229> bit<00:05:17.539> on<00:05:18.539> the<00:05:18.979> side<00:05:19.979> of<00:05:20.159> my

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
scrape a little bit on the side of my

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.350 
scrape a little bit on the side of my
page<00:05:20.550> here<00:05:21.020> we<00:05:22.020> kinda<00:05:22.409> dip<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.159> q-tip<00:05:23.370> in

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
page here we kinda dip the q-tip in

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.620 
page here we kinda dip the q-tip in
to<00:05:25.990> get<00:05:26.789> very<00:05:27.789> close

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
to get very close

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.830 
to get very close
to<00:05:30.440> that<00:05:30.620> but<00:05:30.860> as<00:05:31.040> you<00:05:31.190> can<00:05:31.370> see<00:05:31.640> it's<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.300> don't

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
to that but as you can see it's I don't

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.240 
to that but as you can see it's I don't
know<00:05:33.050> I'm<00:05:33.710> not

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
know I'm not

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.810 
know I'm not
it's<00:05:36.030> not<00:05:36.210> as<00:05:36.390> smooth<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> what<00:05:37.980> I<00:05:38.010> do<00:05:38.190> is<00:05:38.550> I

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
it's not as smooth so what I do is I

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.260 
it's not as smooth so what I do is I
just<00:05:38.850> mostly<00:05:39.330> go<00:05:39.750> over<00:05:40.200> this<00:05:40.820> now<00:05:41.820> because<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
just mostly go over this now because the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.290 
just mostly go over this now because the
colored<00:05:42.600> pencils<00:05:43.110> are<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.500> waxy<00:05:44.070> they<00:05:45.000> really

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
colored pencils are so waxy they really

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.420 
colored pencils are so waxy they really
don't<00:05:45.480> take<00:05:45.780> on<00:05:45.990> any<00:05:46.290> of<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.590> pigments<00:05:47.070> of<00:05:47.190> the

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
don't take on any of the pigments of the

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.640 
don't take on any of the pigments of the
pastels<00:05:47.880> so<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.210> can<00:05:48.420> really<00:05:48.720> go<00:05:48.870> over<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.440> and

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
pastels so you can really go over it and

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.620 
pastels so you can really go over it and
rub<00:05:49.920> it<00:05:50.040> and<00:05:50.280> rub<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:50.910> nothing<00:05:51.390> will

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
rub it and rub it and nothing will

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.720 
rub it and rub it and nothing will
really<00:05:52.020> happen<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.740> would<00:05:53.340> be<00:05:53.490> careful

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
really happen I would be careful

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.180 
really happen I would be careful
obviously<00:05:54.570> with<00:05:54.750> later<00:05:55.080> colored<00:05:55.710> pencils

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
obviously with later colored pencils

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.480 
obviously with later colored pencils
like<00:05:56.400> yellows<00:05:57.080> or<00:05:58.080> even<00:05:58.350> grace<00:05:58.850> but<00:05:59.850> really

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
like yellows or even grace but really

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.090 
like yellows or even grace but really
