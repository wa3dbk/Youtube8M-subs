over the mora classic number one here's

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.560 
over the mora classic number one here's
the<00:00:26.739> knife<00:00:26.919> in<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.610> sheath<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:28.210> sheath<00:00:28.390> is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
the knife in the sheath the sheath is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.479 
the knife in the sheath the sheath is
just<00:00:28.750> some<00:00:29.020> sort<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.290> rigid<00:00:29.710> hard<00:00:29.860> plastic

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
just some sort of rigid hard plastic

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.510 
just some sort of rigid hard plastic
sheath<00:00:30.759> nothing<00:00:31.660> too<00:00:31.809> special<00:00:32.079> nothing<00:00:32.739> crazy

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
sheath nothing too special nothing crazy

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.430 
sheath nothing too special nothing crazy
about<00:00:33.670> it<00:00:34.149> there<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> couple<00:00:35.230> of<00:00:35.320> things

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
about it there is a couple of things

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.750 
about it there is a couple of things
that<00:00:35.620> I'd<00:00:35.710> like<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.890> talk<00:00:36.100> about<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.430> maybe<00:00:36.640> I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
that I'd like to talk about that maybe I

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.740 
that I'd like to talk about that maybe I
haven't<00:00:37.000> seen<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.239> haven't<00:00:37.360> seen<00:00:37.570> in<00:00:37.690> other

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
haven't seen I haven't seen in other

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.180 
haven't seen I haven't seen in other
videos<00:00:38.140> there<00:00:38.380> they're<00:00:38.680> probably<00:00:38.890> out<00:00:39.070> there

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
videos there they're probably out there

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.530 
videos there they're probably out there
but<00:00:39.550> maybe<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:39.790> just<00:00:40.000> haven't<00:00:40.180> found<00:00:40.390> him<00:00:40.510> yet

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
but maybe I just haven't found him yet

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.960 
but maybe I just haven't found him yet
but<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.650> belt<00:00:41.860> loop<00:00:42.040> on<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.280> back<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:42.760> could

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
but the belt loop on the back you could

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.570 
but the belt loop on the back you could
squeeze<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.390> very<00:00:43.750> small<00:00:44.230> thin<00:00:44.590> belt<00:00:44.860> through

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
squeeze a very small thin belt through

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.180 
squeeze a very small thin belt through
that<00:00:45.760> maybe<00:00:46.300> like<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> webbing<00:00:47.350> belt<00:00:47.830> or

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
that maybe like a webbing belt or

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.700 
that maybe like a webbing belt or
something<00:00:48.520> like<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.700> if<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.240> wanted<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.720> and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
something like that if you wanted to and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.500 
something like that if you wanted to and
I<00:00:50.860> understand<00:00:51.310> it's<00:00:51.550> kind<00:00:51.700> of<00:00:51.730> an<00:00:51.850> odd<00:00:52.000> angle

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
I understand it's kind of an odd angle

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.770 
I understand it's kind of an odd angle
for<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> belt<00:00:53.829> design<00:00:54.250> but<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.210> loop<00:00:55.540> this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
for a belt design but the loop this

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.170 
for a belt design but the loop this
little<00:00:56.110> loop<00:00:56.320> up<00:00:56.500> here<00:00:56.770> I<00:00:57.280> actually<00:00:57.640> found<00:00:57.970> out

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
little loop up here I actually found out

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.450 
little loop up here I actually found out
that<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.660> actually<00:00:58.780> four<00:00:59.079> buttons<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.829> what<00:01:00.430> I

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
that is actually four buttons and what I

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.060 
that is actually four buttons and what I
have<00:01:00.760> here<00:01:01.120> is<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.290> have<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.470> torn<00:01:02.800> piece<00:01:03.010> of

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
have here is I have a torn piece of

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.480 
have here is I have a torn piece of
shirt<00:01:03.430> don't<00:01:04.089> ask<00:01:04.299> why<00:01:04.570> don't<00:01:04.989> ask<00:01:05.170> where<00:01:05.490> it

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
shirt don't ask why don't ask where it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.639 
shirt don't ask why don't ask where it
has<00:01:06.640> buttons<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.479> what<00:01:08.350> I'm<00:01:08.439> going<00:01:08.590> to

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
has buttons on it and what I'm going to

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.109 
has buttons on it and what I'm going to
do<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.100> want<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.280> show<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.490> exactly<00:01:09.700> what

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
do is I want to show you exactly what

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.149 
do is I want to show you exactly what
that's<00:01:10.240> used<00:01:10.479> for<00:01:10.659> thing<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.740> what<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:11.920> do<00:01:12.100> is

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
that's used for thing and what you do is

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.520 
that's used for thing and what you do is
you<00:01:12.250> insert<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.729> button<00:01:13.030> obviously<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
you insert the button obviously in the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.310 
you insert the button obviously in the
lower<00:01:14.740> part<00:01:15.190> of<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:15.970> triangular<00:01:16.420> design<00:01:16.750> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
lower part of that triangular design and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770 
lower part of that triangular design and
you<00:01:17.530> slide<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.010> up<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:19.150> literally<00:01:19.420> pops

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
you slide it up and it literally pops

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.740 
you slide it up and it literally pops
into<00:01:20.080> place<00:01:20.430> perfectly<00:01:21.430> with<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.180> top<00:01:22.450> hole

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
into place perfectly with that top hole

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.330 
into place perfectly with that top hole
and<00:01:23.049> then<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.500> becomes<00:01:23.799> like<00:01:23.979> kind<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.220> a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
and then it becomes like kind of a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.170 
and then it becomes like kind of a
dangling<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.960> know<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.350> dangling<00:01:27.130> thing<00:01:27.909> I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
dangling you know a dangling thing I

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.390 
dangling you know a dangling thing I
think<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.870> bigger<00:01:29.049> button<00:01:29.320> would<00:01:29.860> probably<00:01:30.220> do

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
think a bigger button would probably do

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.460 
think a bigger button would probably do
a<00:01:30.430> lot<00:01:30.640> better<00:01:30.790> than<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> smaller<00:01:31.479> ones<00:01:31.570> but<00:01:32.409> I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
a lot better than the smaller ones but I

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.410 
a lot better than the smaller ones but I
think<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.890> range<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.520> motion<00:01:33.880> actually<00:01:34.150> that

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
think the range of motion actually that

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.359 
think the range of motion actually that
you<00:01:34.510> get<00:01:34.690> with<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:34.930> button<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.470> kind<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:36.190> nice

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
you get with this button is kind of nice

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.160 
you get with this button is kind of nice
so<00:01:36.760> that's<00:01:37.090> one<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.390> those<00:01:37.570> aspects<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.110> I

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
so that's one of those aspects that I

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.200 
so that's one of those aspects that I
never<00:01:38.380> really<00:01:38.530> thought<00:01:38.650> about<00:01:39.070> until<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.090> was

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
never really thought about until I was

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.520 
never really thought about until I was
kind<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.420> doing<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.690> little<00:01:40.810> bit<00:01:40.960> research<00:01:41.290> I'm

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
kind of doing a little bit research I'm

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.230 
kind of doing a little bit research I'm
not<00:01:41.650> sure<00:01:41.799> how<00:01:41.979> many<00:01:42.040> people<00:01:42.190> knew<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.760> out

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
not sure how many people knew that out

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.350 
not sure how many people knew that out
there<00:01:43.600> there's<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.340> crust<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.119> Mora

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
there there's the the crust the Mora

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.679 
there there's the the crust the Mora
crust<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:47.350> they<00:01:47.500> have<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:49.299> their

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
crust that they have on all their

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.469 
crust that they have on all their
classic<00:01:50.320> move<00:01:50.710> on<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.970> actual<00:01:52.270> blade

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
classic move on so the actual blade

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.060 
classic move on so the actual blade
itself<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:53.020> actually<00:01:53.350> held<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.830> sheath

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
itself is actually held into the sheath

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.950 
itself is actually held into the sheath
just<00:01:54.369> by<00:01:54.460> friction<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.540> guys<00:01:55.689> didn't<00:01:55.930> know

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
just by friction you guys didn't know

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.230 
just by friction you guys didn't know
that<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.409> kind<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.680> just<00:01:56.830> push<00:01:57.070> down<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:58.060> it

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
that you kind of just push down and it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.630 
that you kind of just push down and it
it<00:01:59.080> holds<00:01:59.290> in<00:01:59.590> pretty<00:01:59.979> well<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:00.520> know<00:02:00.610> I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
it holds in pretty well you know I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.429 
it holds in pretty well you know I
wouldn't<00:02:01.000> obviously<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:01.869> wouldn't<00:02:02.049> rock<00:02:02.260> it

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
wouldn't obviously I wouldn't rock it

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.710 
wouldn't obviously I wouldn't rock it
upside<00:02:02.770> down<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.009> like<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:04.330> know<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.630> I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
upside down and like a you know like I

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.350 
upside down and like a you know like I
got<00:02:04.930> like<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.229> grab<00:02:05.700> style<00:02:06.700> or<00:02:06.939> anything<00:02:07.119> off

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
got like a grab style or anything off

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.619 
got like a grab style or anything off
like<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.659> any<00:02:08.170> kind<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.409> webbing<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:10.539> know

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
like a any kind of webbing but you know

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.330 
like a any kind of webbing but you know
it<00:02:10.810> holds<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.349> really<00:02:11.709> well<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.099> friction

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it holds it in really well the friction

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.909 
it holds it in really well the friction
on<00:02:12.610> its<00:02:12.790> enough<00:02:13.299> that<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.689> that<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.260> kind

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:14.919 
on its enough that it that you can kind

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.369 
on its enough that it that you can kind
of<00:02:15.099> pop<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.459> loose<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.029> wheel<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.299> out<00:02:16.450> so

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
of pop it loose and wheel it out so

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.420 
of pop it loose and wheel it out so
here's<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.769> knife<00:02:17.950> blade<00:02:18.569> really<00:02:19.569> nice

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
here's the knife blade really nice

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.459 
here's the knife blade really nice
going<00:02:20.969> to<00:02:21.030> look<00:02:21.150> around<00:02:21.329> to<00:02:21.719> see<00:02:22.079> you<00:02:22.140> guys<00:02:22.290> can

high<00:02:29.430> carbon<00:02:29.849> steel<00:02:30.659> blade<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.290> was<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.069> to

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
high carbon steel blade I was going to

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.490 
high carbon steel blade I was going to
talk<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> little<00:02:32.519> bit<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:32.790> specs<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.379> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
talk a little bit about specs so the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160 
talk a little bit about specs so the
specs<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.459> overall<00:02:35.790> length<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.810> blade

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
specs so the overall length of the blade

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.839 
specs so the overall length of the blade
portion<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.739> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.099> three<00:02:38.519> point<00:02:38.760> nine

the total length is going to be seven
point<00:02:48.120> eight<00:02:48.389> inches<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.799> hundred

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
point eight inches that's one hundred

point eight inches that's one hundred
ninety<00:02:50.340> nine<00:02:50.370> millimeters<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:52.319> then<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
ninety nine millimeters and then the

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.069 
ninety nine millimeters and then the
actual<00:02:53.790> thickness<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.510> blade<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.870> going

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
actual thickness of the blade is going

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.879 
actual thickness of the blade is going
to<00:02:55.169> be<00:02:56.000> point<00:02:57.000> zero<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.709> point

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
to be point zero it's going to be point

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.580 
to be point zero it's going to be point
zero<00:02:58.950> eight<00:02:59.480> inches<00:03:00.480> thick<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:00.989> two

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
zero eight inches thick or two

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.339 
zero eight inches thick or two
millimeters<00:03:02.659> which<00:03:03.659> is<00:03:03.689> kind<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:03.989> nice<00:03:04.109> you

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
millimeters which is kind of nice you

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.259 
millimeters which is kind of nice you
know<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.799> thick<00:03:05.099> blade<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.969> know<00:03:06.090> I

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
know it's a nice thick blade you know I

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.330 
know it's a nice thick blade you know I
don't<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> guys<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.889> can

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
don't know if you guys know I can

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.459 
don't know if you guys know I can
compare<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.730> against<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.359> moral<00:03:09.810> companion

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
compare it against the moral companion

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.300 
compare it against the moral companion
which<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.280> obviously<00:03:11.639> it's<00:03:11.849> bigger<00:03:12.150> brother

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
which is obviously it's bigger brother

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.479 
which is obviously it's bigger brother
obviously<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.849> stainless<00:03:15.299> steel<00:03:16.489> stainless

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
obviously the stainless steel stainless

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.750 
obviously the stainless steel stainless
steel<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:18.000> going<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.329> lot<00:03:18.540> thicker<00:03:18.780> so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
steel is going to be a lot thicker so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.940 
steel is going to be a lot thicker so
kind<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.849> good<00:03:21.000> comparison<00:03:21.359> there<00:03:21.629> oh<00:03:21.950> yeah

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
kind of a good comparison there oh yeah

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.789 
kind of a good comparison there oh yeah
I<00:03:23.189> mean<00:03:24.120> honestly<00:03:24.720> with<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.319> thinner<00:03:25.530> blade

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
I mean honestly with the thinner blade

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.259 
I mean honestly with the thinner blade
like<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.280> gives<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.639> better<00:03:26.790> cutting

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
like that it gives you a better cutting

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.750 
like that it gives you a better cutting
purpose<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.409> you<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:29.040> don't<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
purpose so you you don't have to you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.890 
purpose so you you don't have to you
don't<00:03:29.849> have<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.150> really<00:03:30.329> force<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.870> through

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
don't have to really force it through

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.259 
don't have to really force it through
material<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.129> thin<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.849> can<00:03:32.970> really

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
material it's so thin that it can really

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.689 
material it's so thin that it can really
slide<00:03:33.720> through<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.229> but<00:03:34.919> grinding<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.549> the

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
slide through it but grinding on the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.210 
slide through it but grinding on the
actual<00:03:35.970> blade<00:03:36.209> itself<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.689> really<00:03:36.870> nice

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
actual blade itself is really nice

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.349 
actual blade itself is really nice
unlike<00:03:38.220> on<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> carbon<00:03:38.760> steel<00:03:38.909> blade<00:03:39.120> it's

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
unlike on the carbon steel blade it's

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.149 
unlike on the carbon steel blade it's
it's<00:03:39.599> been<00:03:39.900> well<00:03:40.199> done<00:03:40.409> and<00:03:40.620> then<00:03:40.709> well<00:03:40.949> high

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
it's been well done and then well high

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.250 
it's been well done and then well high
polished<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:41.849> was<00:03:42.569> going<00:03:42.689> to<00:03:42.750> talk<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.169> guys

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.319 
the handle is it's birch wood handle
which<00:03:49.530> as<00:03:49.769> we<00:03:50.310> all<00:03:50.430> know<00:03:50.579> birch<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.000> really

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
which as we all know birch is really

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.050 
which as we all know birch is really
hard<00:03:51.599> wood<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.650> it's<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.669> actually<00:03:53.939> really

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
hard wood and it's it's actually really

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.710 
hard wood and it's it's actually really
hard<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.419> work<00:03:54.599> with<00:03:54.810> hand<00:03:55.349> tools<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:57.269> mean

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
hard to work with hand tools and I mean

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.289 
hard to work with hand tools and I mean
you<00:03:57.989> can<00:03:58.019> do<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.439> it's<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:58.919> impossible<00:03:59.299> it's

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
you can do it it's not impossible it's

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.050 
you can do it it's not impossible it's
just<00:04:00.569> really<00:04:01.259> hard<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.859> apparently<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.970> know

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
just really hard and apparently you know

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
just really hard and apparently you know
it's<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:03.540> available<00:04:04.109> over<00:04:04.409> there<00:04:04.500> in

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
it's really available over there in

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.539 
it's really available over there in
Sweden<00:04:05.430> where<00:04:05.790> Mora<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.359> obviously<00:04:07.019> stationed

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
Sweden where Mora is obviously stationed

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.819 
Sweden where Mora is obviously stationed
voice<00:04:08.549> from<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.560> obviously<00:04:10.560> they've<00:04:10.680> been

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
voice from and obviously they've been

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.460 
voice from and obviously they've been
producing<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.489> specific<00:04:12.180> blade<00:04:12.449> for<00:04:12.989> over<00:04:13.439> a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
producing this specific blade for over a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.229 
producing this specific blade for over a
hundred<00:04:13.949> years<00:04:14.359> you<00:04:15.359> know<00:04:15.870> probably<00:04:16.289> longer

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
hundred years you know probably longer

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.460 
hundred years you know probably longer
1891<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.449> believe<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.959> when<00:04:19.139> they<00:04:19.289> first

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
1891 I believe this when they first

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.490 
1891 I believe this when they first
started<00:04:19.769> production<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:21.389> that's<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:22.019> long<00:04:22.229> time

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
started production so that's a long time

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.200 
started production so that's a long time
you<00:04:22.919> know<00:04:23.009> they<00:04:23.190> obviously<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.849> gotten<00:04:24.120> it

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
you know they obviously have gotten it

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.430 
you know they obviously have gotten it
right<00:04:24.360> may<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:24.780> been<00:04:24.900> around<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.380> long

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
right may have been around for that long

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.499 
right may have been around for that long
and<00:04:26.009> people<00:04:26.250> love<00:04:26.520> them<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.849> much<00:04:27.150> that

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
and people love them that much that

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.010 
and people love them that much that
they're<00:04:27.870> still<00:04:28.409> here<00:04:28.669> good<00:04:29.669> thing<00:04:29.909> but<00:04:30.840> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
they're still here good thing but the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.719 
they're still here good thing but the
handle<00:04:31.380> itself<00:04:31.650> obviously<00:04:32.219> is<00:04:32.310> birch<00:04:32.520> wood

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
handle itself obviously is birch wood

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.279 
handle itself obviously is birch wood
birch<00:04:33.599> is<00:04:33.779> really<00:04:34.050> hard

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
birch is really hard

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.859 
birch is really hard
are<00:04:34.379> a<00:04:34.409> good<00:04:35.099> knife<00:04:35.909> handle<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.479> then<00:04:36.749> it's

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
are a good knife handle and then it's

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.589 
are a good knife handle and then it's
covered<00:04:37.050> in<00:04:37.349> what<00:04:37.800> they<00:04:37.889> call<00:04:38.069> red<00:04:38.309> ochre<00:04:38.729> it's

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
covered in what they call red ochre it's

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.760 
covered in what they call red ochre it's
kind<00:04:39.749> of<00:04:39.839> spelled<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.139> little<00:04:40.169> funny<00:04:40.529> but

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
kind of spelled a little funny but

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.109 
kind of spelled a little funny but
that's<00:04:40.979> apparently<00:04:41.369> how<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.550> pronounce<00:04:41.909> it

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:42.119 
that's apparently how you pronounce it

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:43.939 
that's apparently how you pronounce it
red<00:04:42.659> ochre<00:04:42.930> has<00:04:43.020> been<00:04:43.139> used<00:04:43.349> for<00:04:43.499> thousands<00:04:43.889> of

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
red ochre has been used for thousands of

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.189 
red ochre has been used for thousands of
years<00:04:44.039> it's<00:04:44.520> basically<00:04:44.789> just<00:04:44.909> a<00:04:45.119> paint<00:04:45.389> that

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
years it's basically just a paint that

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.809 
years it's basically just a paint that
they<00:04:46.409> put<00:04:46.680> over<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:47.069> to<00:04:47.249> protect<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.789> from

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
they put over it to protect it from

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.839 
they put over it to protect it from
moisture<00:04:48.059> or<00:04:48.779> absorbing<00:04:49.499> absorbing<00:04:50.430> any<00:04:50.610> kind

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
moisture or absorbing absorbing any kind

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.909 
moisture or absorbing absorbing any kind
of<00:04:50.879> moisture<00:04:51.029> and<00:04:51.479> red<00:04:52.080> ochre<00:04:52.349> I<00:04:52.379> believe<00:04:52.740> is

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
of moisture and red ochre I believe is

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.689 
of moisture and red ochre I believe is
some<00:04:53.099> sort<00:04:53.309> of<00:04:53.339> red<00:04:53.610> it's<00:04:53.999> a<00:04:54.240> iron<00:04:55.110> oxide

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
some sort of red it's a iron oxide

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.189 
some sort of red it's a iron oxide
component<00:04:56.699> I<00:04:56.909> think<00:04:57.059> it's<00:04:57.419> like<00:04:57.569> derived<00:04:57.960> from

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
component I think it's like derived from

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.409 
component I think it's like derived from
clay<00:04:58.559> or<00:04:59.219> something<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.819> they<00:04:59.909> take<00:05:00.089> it<00:05:00.270> and

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
clay or something and they take it and

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.480 
clay or something and they take it and
it<00:05:00.689> used<00:05:00.869> to<00:05:00.899> be<00:05:00.990> used<00:05:01.139> as<00:05:01.319> paint<00:05:01.559> and<00:05:01.919> all

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
it used to be used as paint and all

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.579 
it used to be used as paint and all
kinds<00:05:02.879> of<00:05:02.909> other<00:05:03.029> things<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.659> I<00:05:03.990> don't<00:05:04.499> know

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:04.589 
kinds of other things and I don't know

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:05.869 
kinds of other things and I don't know
there's<00:05:04.830> a<00:05:04.889> lot<00:05:04.949> of<00:05:05.099> history<00:05:05.460> out<00:05:05.580> there<00:05:05.789> about

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
there's a lot of history out there about

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.329 
there's a lot of history out there about
it<00:05:06.149> but<00:05:06.360> that's<00:05:07.050> basically<00:05:07.349> one<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.039> most

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
it but that's basically one of the most

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.609 
it but that's basically one of the most
primary<00:05:08.669> things<00:05:08.999> I<00:05:09.119> believe<00:05:09.749> it's<00:05:09.959> baked<00:05:10.319> on

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:10.619 
primary things I believe it's baked on

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:12.949 
primary things I believe it's baked on
to<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.639> low<00:05:11.909> enough<00:05:11.939> temperature<00:05:12.209> that<00:05:12.809> it's

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:12.959 
to a low enough temperature that it's

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.679 
to a low enough temperature that it's
just<00:05:13.169> baked<00:05:13.349> right<00:05:13.619> on<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.419> actual

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
just baked right on to the to the actual

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.089 
just baked right on to the to the actual
handle<00:05:16.080> itself<00:05:16.379> even<00:05:16.680> though<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:16.830> made<00:05:16.949> out

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
handle itself even though it's made out

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.920 
handle itself even though it's made out
of<00:05:17.219> wood<00:05:17.399> they<00:05:18.270> have<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.449> have<00:05:18.569> some<00:05:18.719> sort<00:05:18.869> of

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
of wood they have to have some sort of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.139 
of wood they have to have some sort of
hardening<00:05:19.349> or<00:05:19.529> drying<00:05:20.129> process<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:20.939> I'm<00:05:20.999> sure

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:21.149 
hardening or drying process and I'm sure

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:24.499 
hardening or drying process and I'm sure
that's<00:05:21.330> somewhere<00:05:22.110> in<00:05:22.259> there<00:05:22.999> but<00:05:23.999> the<00:05:24.209> actual

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
that's somewhere in there but the actual

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.359 
that's somewhere in there but the actual
blade<00:05:24.779> itself<00:05:24.839> obviously<00:05:25.649> is<00:05:25.740> high<00:05:25.919> high

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:26.369 
blade itself obviously is high high

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.749 
blade itself obviously is high high
carbon<00:05:26.789> high<00:05:27.479> carbon<00:05:27.839> content<00:05:27.959> steel<00:05:28.759> it's

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
carbon high carbon content steel it's

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.329 
carbon high carbon content steel it's
really<00:05:30.149> nice<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.569> takes<00:05:30.869> it<00:05:31.559> picks<00:05:31.949> up<00:05:32.069> almost

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
really nice it takes it picks up almost

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.149 
really nice it takes it picks up almost
every<00:05:32.789> single<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:34.229> picks<00:05:34.439> up<00:05:34.559> almost<00:05:34.770> every

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
every single it picks up almost every

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.860 
every single it picks up almost every
single<00:05:36.529> fingerprint<00:05:37.529> that<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:37.770> put<00:05:38.009> on<00:05:38.159> it<00:05:38.870> so

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
single fingerprint that I put on it so

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.860 
single fingerprint that I put on it so
high<00:05:40.110> carbon<00:05:40.559> steel<00:05:41.029> basically<00:05:42.029> let's<00:05:42.659> talk

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
high carbon steel basically let's talk

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.149 
high carbon steel basically let's talk
about<00:05:42.990> this<00:05:43.199> real<00:05:43.379> quick<00:05:43.559> so<00:05:43.740> Mora<00:05:43.949> has<00:05:44.099> a

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
about this real quick so Mora has a

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.610 
about this real quick so Mora has a
really<00:05:44.430> good<00:05:44.759> they<00:05:45.479> do<00:05:45.539> a<00:05:45.659> really<00:05:45.959> good<00:05:46.080> job<00:05:46.139> of

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
really good they do a really good job of

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.790 
really good they do a really good job of
producing<00:05:47.370> high<00:05:47.999> carbon<00:05:48.360> content<00:05:48.479> blades<00:05:49.019> I'm

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
producing high carbon content blades I'm

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.379 
producing high carbon content blades I'm
not<00:05:49.949> sure<00:05:50.099> exactly<00:05:50.399> what<00:05:50.610> their<00:05:50.969> process<00:05:51.180> is

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
not sure exactly what their process is

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.809 
not sure exactly what their process is
on<00:05:51.749> how<00:05:52.169> they<00:05:52.379> make<00:05:52.559> their<00:05:52.740> carbon<00:05:53.069> steel<00:05:53.309> but

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
on how they make their carbon steel but

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.989 
on how they make their carbon steel but
I<00:05:53.849> know<00:05:53.969> for<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.240> fact<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.599> it's<00:05:54.719> cold-rolled

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
I know for a fact that it's cold-rolled

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.860 
I know for a fact that it's cold-rolled
which<00:05:56.999> means<00:05:57.269> that<00:05:57.479> they've<00:05:57.689> obviously

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
which means that they've obviously

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.679 
which means that they've obviously
heated<00:05:58.469> it<00:05:58.589> and<00:05:58.800> then<00:05:59.370> they<00:05:59.819> let<00:06:00.029> it<00:06:00.149> cool<00:06:00.389> and

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
heated it and then they let it cool and

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.139 
heated it and then they let it cool and
then<00:06:00.809> they<00:06:00.899> put<00:06:01.409> it<00:06:01.439> through<00:06:01.559> a<00:06:01.830> roller<00:06:02.159> which

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
then they put it through a roller which

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.389 
then they put it through a roller which
is<00:06:03.180> part<00:06:04.019> of<00:06:04.139> I<00:06:04.229> think<00:06:04.259> the<00:06:04.529> hardening<00:06:04.919> process

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:05.399 
is part of I think the hardening process

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.369 
is part of I think the hardening process
of<00:06:05.610> how<00:06:05.699> they<00:06:05.849> get<00:06:05.999> it<00:06:06.149> so<00:06:06.360> rigid<00:06:06.839> and<00:06:06.990> then

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
of how they get it so rigid and then

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.019 
of how they get it so rigid and then
obviously<00:06:07.529> they<00:06:07.889> stamp<00:06:08.339> these<00:06:08.519> knives<00:06:08.789> out

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
obviously they stamp these knives out

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.159 
obviously they stamp these knives out
like<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.330> cookie<00:06:09.719> cutter

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
like a cookie cutter

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.019 
like a cookie cutter
they<00:06:10.409> literally<00:06:10.709> stamp<00:06:11.099> these<00:06:11.249> knives<00:06:11.490> out<00:06:11.759> by

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
they literally stamp these knives out by

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.230 
they literally stamp these knives out by
you<00:06:12.389> know<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:12.740> hundreds<00:06:13.740> I'm<00:06:13.889> sure

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
you know the hundreds I'm sure

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.149 
you know the hundreds I'm sure
and<00:06:15.539> then<00:06:15.689> the<00:06:15.809> grinding<00:06:16.259> process<00:06:16.439> obviously

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
and then the grinding process obviously

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.589 
and then the grinding process obviously
goes<00:06:17.339> to<00:06:17.459> the<00:06:17.550> grinding<00:06:17.879> process<00:06:17.999> which<00:06:18.479> is

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
goes to the grinding process which is

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.570 
goes to the grinding process which is
really<00:06:18.719> nice<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.919> then<00:06:20.069> some<00:06:20.309> sort<00:06:20.490> of

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
really nice and then some sort of

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.040 
really nice and then some sort of
hardening<00:06:20.879> process<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.509> then<00:06:21.599> a<00:06:21.629> final

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
hardening process and then a final

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.100 
hardening process and then a final
buffing<00:06:22.259> and<00:06:22.669> sharpening<00:06:23.669> process<00:06:23.939> the<00:06:24.930> buff

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
buffing and sharpening process the buff

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.869 
buffing and sharpening process the buff
on<00:06:25.319> it<00:06:25.439> is<00:06:25.559> very<00:06:25.860> nice<00:06:26.099> you<00:06:26.129> can<00:06:26.459> actually<00:06:26.759> see

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
on it is very nice you can actually see

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.689 
on it is very nice you can actually see
it<00:06:26.969> being<00:06:27.689> very<00:06:27.959> well<00:06:28.169> reflected<00:06:28.740> I<00:06:28.919> don't

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
it being very well reflected I don't

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.129 
it being very well reflected I don't
know<00:06:29.759> if<00:06:29.819> I<00:06:29.879> can<00:06:29.939> blind<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.449> guys<00:06:30.599> real<00:06:30.899> quick

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
know if I can blind you guys real quick

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.759 
know if I can blind you guys real quick
oh<00:06:31.999> it's<00:06:32.999> razor-sharp<00:06:33.599> too<00:06:34.199> by<00:06:34.499> the<00:06:34.529> way

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:34.769 
oh it's razor-sharp too by the way

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.969 
oh it's razor-sharp too by the way
I<00:06:35.009> don't<00:06:35.999> know<00:06:36.169> we're<00:06:37.169> not<00:06:37.259> by<00:06:37.469> easy<00:06:37.619> told<00:06:37.889> you

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
I don't know we're not by easy told you

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:44.170 
I don't know we're not by easy told you
guys<00:06:38.099> that<00:06:40.669> man

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.480 

but<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.210> think<00:06:45.420> it's<00:06:45.540> a<00:06:45.600> really<00:06:45.870> cool<00:06:46.080> knife<00:06:46.490> and

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
but I think it's a really cool knife and

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.250 
but I think it's a really cool knife and
honestly<00:06:48.030> I'm<00:06:48.150> really<00:06:48.270> proud<00:06:48.660> to<00:06:48.720> have<00:06:48.870> it<00:06:49.110> in

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
honestly I'm really proud to have it in

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.190 
honestly I'm really proud to have it in
my<00:06:49.290> in<00:06:50.010> my<00:06:50.520> possession<00:06:51.060> I<00:06:51.480> think<00:06:51.930> it's<00:06:52.050> going

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
my in my possession I think it's going

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.190 
my in my possession I think it's going
to<00:06:52.260> be<00:06:52.320> real<00:06:52.560> fun<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:53.130> have<00:06:53.870> you<00:06:54.870> know<00:06:54.960> and<00:06:55.140> I

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
to be real fun to have you know and I

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.140 
to be real fun to have you know and I
think<00:06:55.260> that<00:06:55.500> I<00:06:55.890> think<00:06:56.550> that<00:06:56.760> it's<00:06:56.940> one<00:06:57.120> of

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
think that I think that it's one of

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.640 
think that I think that it's one of
those<00:06:57.360> things<00:06:57.600> that<00:06:57.720> everybody<00:06:58.290> should<00:06:58.560> go

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
those things that everybody should go

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.350 
those things that everybody should go
and<00:06:58.770> pick<00:06:58.890> up<00:06:58.980> one<00:06:59.220> you<00:06:59.400> know<00:06:59.520> for<00:06:59.700> as<00:06:59.970> cheap<00:07:00.000> as

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
and pick up one you know for as cheap as

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.030 
and pick up one you know for as cheap as
they<00:07:00.390> are<00:07:00.630> and<00:07:00.930> as<00:07:01.050> fun<00:07:01.260> as<00:07:01.410> they<00:07:01.500> can<00:07:01.680> be<00:07:01.830> I

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
they are and as fun as they can be I

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.680 
they are and as fun as they can be I
think<00:07:02.340> it's<00:07:02.580> a<00:07:02.670> really<00:07:02.820> good<00:07:03.060> blade<00:07:03.390> to<00:07:03.540> have

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
think it's a really good blade to have

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.870 
think it's a really good blade to have
around<00:07:04.020> you<00:07:04.650> know<00:07:04.740> it's<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.950> good<00:07:05.130> backup<00:07:05.430> blade

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
around you know it's a good backup blade

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.460 
around you know it's a good backup blade
if<00:07:06.150> you<00:07:06.330> want<00:07:06.570> to<00:07:06.660> take<00:07:06.810> out<00:07:06.960> like<00:07:07.110> a<00:07:07.140> primary

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
if you want to take out like a primary

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.880 
if you want to take out like a primary
blade<00:07:07.950> like<00:07:08.640> if<00:07:08.880> I<00:07:09.060> made<00:07:09.660> my<00:07:09.990> more<00:07:10.290> companion

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
blade like if I made my more companion

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.830 
blade like if I made my more companion
primary<00:07:11.790> blade<00:07:11.970> this<00:07:12.150> would<00:07:12.330> be<00:07:12.450> definitely

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
primary blade this would be definitely

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.930 
primary blade this would be definitely
coming<00:07:13.260> along<00:07:13.470> so<00:07:13.740> one<00:07:14.490> of<00:07:14.520> those<00:07:14.670> things<00:07:14.820> to

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
coming along so one of those things to

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.240 
coming along so one of those things to
think<00:07:15.120> about<00:07:15.260> and<00:07:16.260> I<00:07:16.590> was<00:07:16.680> going<00:07:16.830> to<00:07:16.890> kind<00:07:17.220> of

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
think about and I was going to kind of

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.690 
think about and I was going to kind of
little<00:07:17.610> bit<00:07:17.660> comparison<00:07:18.660> against<00:07:18.900> the<00:07:19.700> 5-11

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
little bit comparison against the 5-11

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.990 
little bit comparison against the 5-11
here<00:07:21.180> 511<00:07:22.080> is<00:07:22.140> a<00:07:22.200> little<00:07:22.500> bit<00:07:22.590> longer<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:23.790> same
