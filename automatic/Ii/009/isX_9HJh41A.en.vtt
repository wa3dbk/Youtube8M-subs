00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.540
 hello to the whole track more than a 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.429
 witness chief of the feats of arms 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.820
 have today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.040
 little trick kaman that will concern a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.230
 success this success we'll see it all from 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.170
 next if I click in the right place 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.570
 hop su create this success as I already 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.910
 selected you can see it's 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.770
 the loads of boots so licking of 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.870
 boots it's a success that gives one that 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.000
 give a title 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.650
 in this case this is a thing that suits us 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.530
 interest us in this tip cava 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.960
 it is the resources that must be given 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.450
 to get this title as you the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.670
 know there are many who make them 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.940
 do the successes so especially points 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.160
 even titles and suddenly the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.620
 resources that will take for this pure 7 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.190
 by naming are going to be relatively 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.290
 search and so here we are we go 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.460
 to focus more specifically on 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.680
 thing that has to bring back percent what 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.350
 success and this thing that's all 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.740
 stupidly a little white cat so the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.340
 little white cats it takes 6 by 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.500
 park is so much you start to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.690
 understand 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.510
 the little manipulation to get this 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.880
 little cat white cat them 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.980
 either you know it as I am I 'm going 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 take it you must make the reference 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.800
 10 boxes is a dungeon he manages 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.960
 with you manage with a team about 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.150
 Level 120 So here favre a small 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.400
 point behind needs to be managed 110 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.390
 minimum after obviously the more you are 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.770
 at the level more know how to go fast and is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.190
 so here's to make this dungeon you 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.320
 turn in 18 - 36 so ca ca pandala 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.620
 as you can see on the map 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.240
 so it's here so here you come 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.940
 with a sim telling you I have here you 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.350
 make the dungeon and at the end of the dungeon 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.760
 you have in reward so it's a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.890
 reward the automatic it absolutely 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.260
 not a drop a little cat white cat 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 so this little white cat cat like I 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.679
 wanted to tell it just now it's a 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.130
 components of this quest and by 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.130
 consequent 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.819
 the price of this pet who were 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 about 500 who has twenty selling hotels 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.049
 before he was really nothing he was 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.609
 really totally useless unless you 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.319
 climb it was really not worth the 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:32.209
 blow and good today 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:34.639
 ivo on average average level 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.439
 normally the average price since 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.120
 that success is gone it's 200 miles 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.769
 to the general never sees it below 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.930
 100 miles there you see who are when 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.780
 even at 50000 so 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.040
 so here it is rather advantageous 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840
 just stupid enough to make the dungeon 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 so you'll see that in general prices 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.310
 are really up treacherous and soap 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.030
 two years then generates there it's really 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.969
 exceptional 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.199
 the cheapest is 50 miles this is the 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.959
 first time it happens since 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.849
 since I will know this market so it 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.699
 and so that's usually about 100 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.099
 miles up to 250 miles I saw riding 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.199
 up to 350 miles so that's it's 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.460
 really a very good very good 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:14.450
 trick that makes 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.760
 very easily with a little movie is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.530
 so here I hope this trick 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.970
 camin pleased you if you press va 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.290
 press the little green thumb risk 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.910
 if you want to continue to follow the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.410
 adventures of the family zone and ben
