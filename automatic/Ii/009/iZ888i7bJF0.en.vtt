like over really wrote it in my head

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.350 
like over really wrote it in my head
thinking<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.400> could<00:02:35.550> be<00:02:35.640> something<00:02:35.820> else<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
thinking it could be something else and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.520 
thinking it could be something else and
it<00:02:36.840> says<00:02:37.050> right<00:02:37.080> there<00:02:37.380> um<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:39.090> says<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.540> rousing

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it says right there um it says a rousing

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.350 
it says right there um it says a rousing
adventure<00:02:40.890> story<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> tradition<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.240> the

Hunger<00:02:42.630> Games<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.500> thought<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.770> was<00:02:43.860> going

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
Hunger Games so I thought it was going

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.040 
Hunger Games so I thought it was going
to<00:02:44.100> be<00:02:44.250> more<00:02:44.460> along<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:44.970> lines<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.720> hey

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and that's not really the path that this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.810 
and that's not really the path that this
story<00:02:57.750> takes<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.290> has<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> lot<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.640> those

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
story takes it has a lot of those

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.080 
story takes it has a lot of those
elements<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:01.020> like<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:02.090> prominent

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
elements but it's not like as prominent

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.250 
elements but it's not like as prominent
as<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.300> thought<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.570> was<00:03:03.630> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.020> and

looks<00:04:53.729> a<00:04:53.820> lot<00:04:53.970> like<00:04:54.180> house<00:04:54.419> but<00:04:54.449> like<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.870> little

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
looks a lot like house but like a little

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.500 
looks a lot like house but like a little
different<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:56.060> think<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.150> looks<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.300> lot<00:04:57.389> like

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
different I think it looks a lot like

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.020 
different I think it looks a lot like
house<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.990> might<00:04:58.199> be<00:04:58.290> house<00:04:58.790> that<00:04:59.790> were<00:04:59.910> the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
house it might be house that were the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.790 
house it might be house that were the
book<00:05:01.850> but<00:05:02.850> yeah<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:04.320> was<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> lot

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
book but yeah so it was just a lot

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
book but yeah so it was just a lot
different<00:05:05.070> than<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.250> thought<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.430> was<00:05:05.550> going<00:05:05.729> to

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
different than I thought it was going to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.580 
different than I thought it was going to
be<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.450> think<00:05:06.479> that's<00:05:06.780> why<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.020> didn't

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
be and I think that's why it didn't

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.590 
be and I think that's why it didn't
really<00:05:07.680> hit<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.160> for<00:05:08.370> me<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:09.150> make<00:05:09.389> sure<00:05:09.419> you

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
did really enjoy it i did enjoy reading

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.340 
did really enjoy it i did enjoy reading
it<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.970> just<00:05:21.120> when<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.419> broke<00:05:21.600> it<00:05:21.780> down<00:05:21.810> it

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
it but just when you broke it down it

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.100 
it but just when you broke it down it
wasn't<00:05:23.570> structurally<00:05:26.270> pointwise<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.810> great

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
wasn't structurally pointwise a great

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.740 
wasn't structurally pointwise a great
book<00:05:28.520> because<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.820> got<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> couple<00:05:30.539> points

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
book because I got a couple points

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.300 
book because I got a couple points
deducted<00:05:31.169> for<00:05:31.410> not<00:05:31.560> me<00:05:31.680> not<00:05:31.830> like

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
deducted for not me not like

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.650 
deducted for not me not like
understanding<00:05:32.820> their<00:05:32.970> relating<00:05:33.449> to<00:05:33.570> the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
understanding their relating to the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.090 
understanding their relating to the
character<00:05:33.990> we<00:05:34.080> got<00:05:34.229> a<00:05:34.260> point<00:05:34.560> seductive

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
character we got a point seductive

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.590 
character we got a point seductive
because<00:05:35.280> I<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:36.090> plot<00:05:36.330> kind<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.960> got<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.560> little

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
because I the plot kind of got a little

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.110 
because I the plot kind of got a little
overdone<00:05:39.600> for<00:05:39.870> me<00:05:40.280> but<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.610> was<00:05:41.760> still<00:05:41.970> really

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
overdone for me but it was still really

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.870 
overdone for me but it was still really
really<00:05:42.510> good<00:05:42.690> I<00:05:43.280> remember<00:05:44.280> like<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.460> lot<00:05:44.610> i<00:05:44.639> read

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
really good I remember like a lot i read

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.010 
really good I remember like a lot i read
it<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.210> i<00:05:45.930> think<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:48.300> way<00:05:48.389> that<00:05:48.510> end<00:05:48.690> I

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
it and i think that the way that end I

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.710 
it and i think that the way that end I
think<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:49.860> is<00:05:49.889> a<00:05:50.340> really<00:05:50.669> good<00:05:50.970> series<00:05:51.360> starter

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
think it is a really good series starter

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.650 
think it is a really good series starter
if<00:05:51.900> it's<00:05:52.080> going<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.289> be<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.410> series<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.669> that's

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
if it's going to be a series so that's

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.219 
if it's going to be a series so that's
good<00:05:54.960> um<00:05:56.000> yeah<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.240> looks<00:05:57.570> like<00:05:57.750> it's<00:05:57.900> going<00:05:58.050> to

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
good um yeah it looks like it's going to

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.159 
good um yeah it looks like it's going to
be<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.349> great<00:05:58.919> series<00:05:59.190> because<00:05:59.580> it<00:06:00.300> did<00:06:00.750> set<00:06:01.020> up

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
be a great series because it did set up

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.230 
be a great series because it did set up
a<00:06:01.289> lot<00:06:01.530> of<00:06:01.650> things<00:06:01.830> in<00:06:02.160> like<00:06:02.849> where<00:06:03.060> it<00:06:03.150> was

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
a lot of things in like where it was

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.330 
a lot of things in like where it was
lacking<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.810> was<00:06:03.900> because<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.380> was<00:06:04.410> giving<00:06:05.310> you

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
lacking it was because it was giving you

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.480 
lacking it was because it was giving you
so<00:06:05.639> much<00:06:05.789> backstory<00:06:06.470> like<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.680> know<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:08.190> could
