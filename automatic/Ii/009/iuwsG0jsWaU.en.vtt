00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
the foundation of what I base my

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.039 
the foundation of what I base my
programs<00:00:48.409> off<00:00:48.650> of<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.640> continue<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.299> you

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
programs off of and and continue to you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.829 
programs off of and and continue to you
know<00:00:51.080> adapt<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.769> modify<00:00:51.920> with<00:00:52.570> these<00:00:53.570> are<00:00:53.720> by

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
know adapt and modify with these are by

know adapt and modify with these are by
no<00:00:53.900> means<00:00:54.820> everything<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.970> use<00:00:56.299> but<00:00:56.659> they<00:00:56.930> are<00:00:57.170> a

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
no means everything I use but they are a

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.049 
no means everything I use but they are a
great<00:00:57.650> start<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.309> always<00:00:58.580> something<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:58.940> I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
great start and always something that I

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.219 
great start and always something that I
can<00:00:59.269> refer<00:00:59.420> back<00:00:59.930> to<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:01.100> forget<00:01:01.489> something

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
can refer back to if I forget something

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.990 
can refer back to if I forget something
something<00:01:03.229> doesn't<00:01:03.440> seem<00:01:03.769> right<00:01:03.830> or<00:01:04.280> want<00:01:04.879> to

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
something doesn't seem right or want to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.820 
something doesn't seem right or want to
find<00:01:05.299> out<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.630> best<00:01:05.869> way<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.110> implement

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
find out the best way to implement

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.020 
find out the best way to implement
something<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:08.060> into<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:09.159> program<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.520> may

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
something back into a program that may

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.270 
something back into a program that may
be<00:01:11.450> new<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:12.680> let's<00:01:12.710> get<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:13.640> rolling

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
be new so let's get this rolling

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880 
be new so let's get this rolling
starting<00:01:16.280> off<00:01:16.689> training<00:01:17.689> wise<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.590> know<00:01:18.619> one

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
starting off training wise you know one

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.499 
starting off training wise you know one
of<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.369> basic<00:01:19.520> ones<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.299> think

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
of the the basic ones that I think

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.090 
of the the basic ones that I think
everyone<00:01:20.869> should<00:01:20.899> at<00:01:21.109> least<00:01:21.200> have<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.469> copy<00:01:21.829> of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
everyone should at least have a copy of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.980 
everyone should at least have a copy of
is<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.000> essentials<00:01:23.509> of<00:01:23.630> strength<00:01:23.869> to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is the essentials of strength to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.590 
is the essentials of strength to
strength<00:01:24.590> training<00:01:24.890> conditioning<00:01:25.609> I<00:01:25.850> don't

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
strength training conditioning I don't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.090 
strength training conditioning I don't
know<00:01:26.719> they're<00:01:26.899> probably<00:01:27.049> unlike<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.560> 58th

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
know they're probably unlike the 58th

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.880 
know they're probably unlike the 58th
edition<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.780> third<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.500> is

edition now this is the third this is
actually<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.219> second<00:01:31.640> copy<00:01:31.850> I've<00:01:32.090> had<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.450> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
actually the second copy I've had of it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.830 
actually the second copy I've had of it
I<00:01:33.490> had<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.729> believe<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.119> first<00:01:35.329> edition

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
I had I believe the first edition

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.010 
I had I believe the first edition
whenever<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:36.170> first<00:01:36.380> took<00:01:36.590> my<00:01:37.329> CSCS<00:01:38.329> test<00:01:38.659> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
whenever I first took my CSCS test and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.709 
whenever I first took my CSCS test and
sold<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.499> and<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.310> pick<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.700> one<00:01:40.850> back<00:01:41.030> up<00:01:41.270> it

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
sold it and so pick this one back up it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.870 
sold it and so pick this one back up it
is<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.229> great<00:01:42.469> you<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.130> basic<00:01:45.460> macro<00:01:46.460> or

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
is just a great you know basic macro or

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.090 
is just a great you know basic macro or
yeah<00:01:47.270> macro<00:01:47.689> view<00:01:47.929> of<00:01:48.170> everything<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.920> need

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
to know in terms of just science behind

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.950 
to know in terms of just science behind
it<00:01:52.280> nutrition<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:52.999> just<00:01:53.179> kind<00:01:53.359> of<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.869> know

solid base of what - you know what to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.029 
solid base of what - you know what to
expect<00:01:59.719> and<00:01:59.869> how<00:01:59.929> to<00:02:00.049> train<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.619> how<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.740> set
