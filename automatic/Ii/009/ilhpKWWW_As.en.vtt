 for example, people who do it themselves 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 But do not panic after fish 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 and then it could work out the same way yes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.400
 and what will we do first? 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 Drain the cherries and then theirs 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.070
 field water and then catch 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.159
 everything with the schnapps we drink 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 do not need any cherries 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 but let us then you are 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 rauszuholen 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 I just got off all the time 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.259
 you can rest in your musli 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:29.009

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:32.060
 just in yogurt google do something like that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 of course we drain now and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.119
 we start 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.470
 beautiful churches you see here is the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.909
 rocked out and then 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.170
 just a 2 1 because we take a while 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 hollow body we read and maybe 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 but here it is better to fit a half 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.010
 purely for city if I have a whole yes 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.720
 because just this just too big 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.530
 Now let's go take something from us 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 his liquor and pour this here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.670
 over it so in the end better we 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.980
 Now the cherries are nice with the alcohol 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 this remains the case comes aside and in the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.430
 In the meantime we have here now 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.430

 mesh on the table why so with the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.820
 bubbles in the bottom are behind 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.360
 rise above and thus the whole 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.470
 chocolat pulls itself nicely into the crevices 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.680
 You can see it here as well 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.090
