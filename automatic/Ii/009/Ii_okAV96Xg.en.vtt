it<00:06:08.440> new<00:06:11.730> not<00:06:12.730> sure<00:06:12.880> once<00:06:13.090> worse<00:06:13.390> so<00:06:13.810> should<00:06:14.260> we

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
it new not sure once worse so should we

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.670 
it new not sure once worse so should we
do<00:06:18.510> so<00:06:19.510> he<00:06:19.570> probably<00:06:19.750> has<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.020> equip<00:06:20.320> card<00:06:20.530> a

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
do so he probably has that equip card a

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.530 
do so he probably has that equip card a
to<00:06:21.070> make<00:06:21.250> him<00:06:21.370> get<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.550> secondary<00:06:22.000> maybe<00:06:22.270> i

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
to make him get a secondary maybe i

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.810 
to make him get a secondary maybe i
would<00:06:22.930> guess<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:23.800> so<00:06:24.280> would<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.430> translate
