 video how to prepare a natural yogurt 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.800
 these are the materials that we are going to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 use to prepare our self in a 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.350
 big pot let's put the content 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 of the liter of milk that I chose in this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.090
 case is of diet you can choose the milk 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.010
 that you want can be skimmed 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 lactose - free or if it is for children with a 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.880
 special milk with chewing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.080
 It is special for growth of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 children 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.910
 you can prepare it with the milk that you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910
 want 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 now since we have the milk in our 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.100
 we are going to add yogurt 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 med a natural of our choice I 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.270
 I chose a diet can put type 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.000
 activia the yogurt with the characteristics 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 that you want 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.010
 I decided to add sugar to help 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.740
 to the fermentation process and that its 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.780
 consistency is even thicker since 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.190
 sugar is what will help us 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.530
 have a much more creamy consistency 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.300
 now if you do not want to add sugar what 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.840
 can express how I am going to show 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.400
 continued with milk powder milk 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.710
 Powder is also of your choice 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.560
 they can put skim milk powder 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.420
 whole or if it is for our children by 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.810
 a special formula for them in this 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 case establishes a like when we already have 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.300
 all the mix ready and we can help each other 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 with a thermometer the temperature for 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.570
 achieve yogurt are 42 degrees Celsius and 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.970
 If we do not have a thermometer, I'm going to 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.550
 teach a trick that can help us 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.550
 putting a finger inside the milk 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.640
 when the temperature bothers us 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.160
 we feel we are burning 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.040
 then we remove the finger turn off the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.210
 mix and immediately we're going to put it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.240
 in the container that we are going to use 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.420
 be a thermos or a glass container for 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.790
 prepare our yogurt 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.950
 in this thermos I'm going to deposit the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.800
 content of my yogurt 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.900
 Now I put it in another vessel so that 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.239
 It was easier being able to get into the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.660
 thermos because the mouthpiece is very narrow 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.879
 and I'm going to put all the content of my 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.450
 Yogurt is important to do when you're 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.180
 hot I leave it all night in a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.080
 part dark and the next day I can 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.580
 take out my yogurt is completely ready 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.100
 and natural and does not get fat 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.380
 this is the consistency of the yogurt is 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.710
 as I wanted dessert type it was super 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.300
 super super thick so I can lower it 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.300
 with another liter of milk 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.130
 Now I'll teach you how to prepare a 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.560
 delicious fruit syrup that you 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.690
 choose to add to your yogurt 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.690
 I chose strawberry 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.650
 let's put the tip that we chose in 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.080
 the blender we are going to add a 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.410
 little water only that covers it 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.640
 the exact water to liquefy it without 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.730
 that is going to damage our 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.730
 blender for lack of water and ready 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.450
 and you do not want it to be totally 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.970
 liquefied he wants me to have a little 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.030
 of chips the yogurt because simply what 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.740
 They are tiny and we will forget about 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.620
 this step the liquefied and we passed 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.080
 directly to the pan with a little 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.780
 of sugar preferably sugar of 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.470
 diet to make it much healthier 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.470
 our yogurt 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.420
 we stir very well and we put it to 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.070
 fire to boil because you have to 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.360
 Take away a little the degree of acidity 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.850
 the fruit so it will not be cut 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.860
 our yogurt because it's totally 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.410
 natural does not have preservatives does not have 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.700
 then nothing is important to check the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.610
 acidity of the fruit that we are going to 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.270
 add to our yogurt in this case I 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.480
 I'm going to let it boil a little 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.070
 already boiled and then it will be less 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.740
 acid for when you add it to me 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.560
 yogurt to spice up the whole 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.800
 yogurt or just to give you a 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.540
 touch of flavor to yogurt as a dessert 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.690
 work very well and I'm not going to 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.690
 cut 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.900
 well I'll show you in this glass 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.770
 so they see how thick the creamy is and 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.130
 100% diet has no fat sugar 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.370
 What is special about weight loss? 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.440
 so super life 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.660
 and you want it, can you? 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.300
 show how it can be like a delicious 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.550
 yogurt type dessert so super thickened you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.400
 we take a little bit of the syrup 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.820
 we prepare the same as you can eat 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.820
 delicious 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.120
 or in the case that mine I'm going to 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.120
 put all my yogurt the taste of 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.639
 strawberry because I love that flavor and 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.449
 yogurt so I'm going to add my 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.280
 syrup that I already have strawberry ready and 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.620
 Now I'm going to stir it very well 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.650
 so that it is well incorporated 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.710
 and ready we revolve it super well up 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.260
 that is a homogeneous mixture and we will 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.260
 to be delicious then we put it to the 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.340
 refrigerator and it is delicious to drink it not 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.500
 cold as a snack I recommend it 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.720
 in the snack which breakfast with the 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.670
 cereal is very rich 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.830
 and ready 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.969
 Well now I'm going to teach you 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.749
 as it was ready 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:51.869
 delicious yogurt 100% light for 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:53.429
 enjoy and I show you also in the 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:55.559
 two presentations that can 

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:57.739
 Enjoy what you can enjoy as 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:59.999
 yogurt or as dessert is delicious 

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:01.829
 we can use this type of thermos 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:03.839
 to and put the content of our 

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:05.759
 yogurt we usually use them for 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.709
 keep water hot from the teteros 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.439
 of our babies this was the model that 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:11.759
 I used to do my madness this 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.409
 model of terno can also us 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.269
 work very well but let's find one 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.669
 that does not have such a high capacity 

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:19.259
 rather, this type of packaging can 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.909
 work very well to put in the 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.199
 content of yogurt and you always have to 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.929
 sterilize thoroughly before 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:27.539
 use them around them we are going to 

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:29.610
 put unoccupied houses of milk with 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.469
 hot water to help maintain a 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.520
 adequate temperature so that they can be 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.759
 to ferment very well 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:40.020
 and you can enter inside a 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:42.930
 Polystyrene refrigerator or in a cooler of this 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.870
 good plastic today I want to talk to you 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.550
 a little bit of why we take yogurt 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.259
 will help a lot because the yogurt 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.289
 will help us improve the flora 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:55.379
 intestinal will help us to reduce 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:58.139
 blood cholesterol and it's also going 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.360
 to help because they have new bacteria 

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.759
 which are very beneficial for our 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.880
 organism especially in the process of 

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:09.490
 digestion have a lot of calcium and 

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.380
 They have many vitamins and minerals 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.569
