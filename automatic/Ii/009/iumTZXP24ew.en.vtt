that you see on the right is the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
that you see on the right is the
difference<00:00:23.460> engine<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
difference engine one that was the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.689 
difference engine one that was the
machine<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.470> Charles<00:00:25.800> Babbage<00:00:26.130> created

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
machine that Charles Babbage created

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
machine that Charles Babbage created
really<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:28.109> across<00:00:28.349> his<00:00:28.740> ideas<00:00:30.560> about<00:00:31.560> how

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
really to get across his ideas about how

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.240 
really to get across his ideas about how
to<00:00:31.890> calculate<00:00:33.320> how<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> mechanize<00:00:34.860> human

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to calculate how to mechanize human

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.900 
to calculate how to mechanize human
thought<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> model<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.489> he<00:00:38.730> had

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
thought so this was a model that he had

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
thought so this was a model that he had
on<00:00:39.030> his<00:00:39.210> desk<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> he<00:00:39.930> would<00:00:40.079> invite<00:00:40.290> people

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
on his desk and he would invite people

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
on his desk and he would invite people
round<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.190> come<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> his<00:00:42.059> his

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
round to come and see his his

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.100 
round to come and see his his
calculating<00:00:42.989> machine<00:00:43.579> he'd<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
calculating machine he'd have a lot of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
calculating machine he'd have a lot of
parties<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.320> saturday<00:00:46.530> nights<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:47.370> said

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
parties on saturday nights and he said

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
parties on saturday nights and he said
you<00:00:47.789> know<00:00:47.820> come<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.719> come<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.050> look<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you know come and come and look at this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
you know come and come and look at this
machine<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.460> joined<00:00:50.850> enthused<00:00:51.719> people

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
machine and he joined enthused people

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
machine and he joined enthused people
about<00:00:52.969> calculating<00:00:53.969> engines<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.960> with

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
about calculating engines and about with

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
about calculating engines and about with
the<00:00:55.140> possibilities<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.039> mechanizing<00:00:57.030> human

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the possibilities of mechanizing human

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.029 
the possibilities of mechanizing human
thought<00:00:59.149> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.300> he<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.199> very<00:01:01.230> much<00:01:01.410> part<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
thought it was he was very much part of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
thought it was he was very much part of
the<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> social<00:01:02.910> elite<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the kind of social elite with in

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.310 
the kind of social elite with in
Victorian<00:01:04.320> London<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.010> he<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:06.320> would

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
Victorian London so he you know would

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320 
Victorian London so he you know would
talk<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> Great<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
at the Science Museum but he never

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.940 
at the Science Museum but he never
actually<00:01:32.090> completed<00:01:33.090> building<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.950> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
actually completed building it and in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
actually completed building it and in
the<00:01:34.979> 1980s<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.150> team<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> Science<00:01:36.869> Museum

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the 1980s the team at the Science Museum

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830 
the 1980s the team at the Science Museum
led<00:01:38.970> by<00:01:39.329> Doron<00:01:39.810> Swade<00:01:40.009> built<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.299> Difference

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
led by Doron Swade built the Difference

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.160 
led by Doron Swade built the Difference
Engine<00:01:42.990> 2<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.329> completed<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:45.990> his

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
Engine 2 and that was completed for his

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
Engine 2 and that was completed for his
to<00:01:46.829> 200<00:01:47.549> years<00:01:47.700> after<00:01:48.000> his<00:01:48.119> birth<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:50.000> 1991<00:01:51.000> was

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to 200 years after his birth so 1991 was

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
to 200 years after his birth so 1991 was
the<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> opening<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the kind of opening of the the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.090 
the kind of opening of the the
Difference<00:01:53.610> Engine<00:01:53.729> 2<00:01:54.119> i'll<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.259> show<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Difference Engine 2 i'll just show you a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609 
Difference Engine 2 i'll just show you a
little<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> video<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> working<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
little bit of video of that working and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:12.130 
little bit of video of that working and
explain<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.520> about<00:02:00.479> it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.150 

so<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.470> every<00:02:14.599> 4<00:02:15.599> turns<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.319> handle<00:02:16.800> you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so for every 4 turns of the handle you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.199 
so for every 4 turns of the handle you
do<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.520> calculation<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.670> machine<00:02:21.000> works

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
do one calculation the machine works

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.589 
do one calculation the machine works
purely<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.750> addition<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.739> doesn't<00:02:23.040> do

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
purely on addition it doesn't do

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.750 
purely on addition it doesn't do
division<00:02:24.599> or<00:02:25.080> multiplication<00:02:25.489> was<00:02:26.489> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
division or multiplication was a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.780 
division or multiplication was a
subtraction<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:28.440> purely<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.980> additions<00:02:29.430> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
subtraction it's purely on additions so

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
school that these were full of errors so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.320 
school that these were full of errors so
Babbage<00:02:50.340> thought<00:02:50.549> well<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:50.819> we<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.120> create

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
Babbage thought well if we can create

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.500 
Babbage thought well if we can create
this<00:02:51.540> machine<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.760> calculates<00:02:54.299> it

this machine that calculates it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
this machine that calculates it
mechanically<00:02:55.049> they<00:02:55.440> won't<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.739> any<00:02:55.860> errors

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
mechanically they won't have any errors

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.300 
mechanically they won't have any errors
and<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> prints<00:02:57.180> them<00:02:57.299> as<00:02:57.450> well<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:59.280> know

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and if it prints them as well you know

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.070 
and if it prints them as well you know
no<00:02:59.610> errors<00:02:59.880> will<00:03:00.030> creep<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.599> people

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
no errors will creep in when people

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.870 
no errors will creep in when people
write<00:03:01.440> down<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.860> numbers<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.440> has<00:03:04.590> over

their the carrying arm so that what
they're<00:03:20.549> actually<00:03:20.640> doing<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.180> checking<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:21.600> a

of<00:03:33.000> dancing<00:03:33.480> DNA<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.319> think<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.769> them<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
of dancing DNA I think it's them and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.789 
of dancing DNA I think it's them and
what<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.209> see<00:03:36.359> here<00:03:36.569> at<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> end<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.380> actually

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
what you see here at the end is actually

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.199 
what you see here at the end is actually
the<00:03:37.950> printer<00:03:38.370> which<00:03:38.549> was<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.819> was<00:03:38.970> slightly

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the printer which was I was slightly

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.199 
the printer which was I was slightly
later<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.280> here<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.549> see<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.760> printing

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
later so here you see the printing

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.180 
later so here you see the printing
device<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.720> enables<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.709> whole<00:03:43.889> thing<00:03:44.069> to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
device that enables the whole thing to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.740

be<00:03:44.280> completed<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:45.030> could<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.269> printed<00:03:45.600> onto

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
be completed that could be printed onto

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.920 
be completed that could be printed onto

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
paper onto papier-mache or anything so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.530 
paper onto papier-mache or anything so
you<00:03:48.959> could<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:49.430> print<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.579> forward<00:03:51.239> into

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you could then print that forward into

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.770 
you could then print that forward into
books<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.049> tables<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> Babbage<00:03:54.060> himself<00:03:54.480> never

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
books of tables so Babbage himself never

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
books of tables so Babbage himself never
never<00:03:55.530> actually<00:03:55.709> saw<00:03:55.980> his<00:03:56.190> machine<00:03:56.519> working

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
never actually saw his machine working

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.670 
never actually saw his machine working
which<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.480> terrible<00:03:58.079> shame<00:03:58.350> but<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
which is a terrible shame but the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.129 
which is a terrible shame but the
Science<00:03:58.950> Museum<00:03:59.540> used<00:04:00.540> many<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:00.989> same

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
Science Museum used many of the same

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.120 
Science Museum used many of the same

actually<00:04:05.250> did<00:04:05.519> all<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.790> work<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.180> same

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
actually did all the work to the same

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.210 
actually did all the work to the same
tolerances<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.380> Babbage<00:04:07.799> would<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.069> had

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
tolerances that Babbage would have had

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.789 
tolerances that Babbage would have had
to<00:04:08.940> prove<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.239> Babbage's<00:04:10.139> designs<00:04:10.500> would

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
to prove that Babbage's designs would

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.229 
to prove that Babbage's designs would

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
have been realizable had he actually

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.099 
have been realizable had he actually
ever<00:04:12.510> completed<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.500> Machine<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.629> the

ever completed the Machine and it the

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.390 
ever completed the Machine and it the
work<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.530> did<00:04:16.650> showed<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.220> was

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
work that we did showed that was

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.610 
work that we did showed that was
possible<00:04:17.909> and<00:04:18.180> actually<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.229> reason<00:04:19.409> it

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
possible and actually the reason it

possible and actually the reason it
never<00:04:19.650> happened

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160

was<00:04:20.250> probably<00:04:20.430> because<00:04:20.700> he<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.060> such<00:04:21.180> a

asked<00:04:28.560> him<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.770> move<00:04:28.920> into<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.610> about<00:04:29.760> payment

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
asked him to move into and about payment

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.260 
asked him to move into and about payment
and<00:04:31.590> he<00:04:31.740> was<00:04:31.890> known<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.400> know<00:04:32.520> has<00:04:32.730> been<00:04:32.970> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
and he was known you know has been a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.400

complex character anyway he was fell out

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.110 
complex character anyway he was fell out
with<00:04:37.590> people<00:04:38.100> who<00:04:38.190> used<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.460> play<00:04:38.490> music<00:04:39.000> in

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
with people who used to play music in

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.270 
with people who used to play music in
the<00:04:39.180> street<00:04:39.450> outside<00:04:39.660> his<00:04:40.020> house<00:04:40.230> was<00:04:41.160> always

the street outside his house was always

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.860 
the street outside his house was always
shouting<00:04:41.580> at<00:04:41.850> them<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.300> they<00:04:42.330> always<00:04:42.690> used

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
shouting at them and so they always used

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.330 
shouting at them and so they always used
to<00:04:42.930> come<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.140> play<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.470> music<00:04:43.560> outside<00:04:43.950> his

grumpy I love this picture it's about

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.450 
grumpy I love this picture it's about
ten<00:05:00.360> years<00:05:00.570> before<00:05:00.630> he<00:05:01.020> died<00:05:01.200> he<00:05:01.230> looked<00:05:01.650> very

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
ten years before he died he looked very

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.860 
ten years before he died he looked very
miserable<00:05:04.580> there<00:05:05.580> are<00:05:05.700> some<00:05:05.910> much<00:05:06.120> much<00:05:06.660> more

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
miserable there are some much much more

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.960 
miserable there are some much much more
favorable<00:05:07.410> pictures<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.250> him<00:05:08.430> than<00:05:08.610> this<00:05:08.730> one

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
favorable pictures of him than this one

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.770 
favorable pictures of him than this one
but<00:05:09.660> this<00:05:10.140> is<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.290> proper<00:05:10.620> photograph<00:05:11.130> so<00:05:11.780> but

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
but this is a proper photograph so but

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.960 
but this is a proper photograph so but
the<00:05:12.870> reason<00:05:12.990> he's<00:05:13.320> some<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.160> significant<00:05:14.880> and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
the reason he's some so significant and

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.430 
the reason he's some so significant and
important<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.630> us<00:05:15.720> i<00:05:15.840> think<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.170> really

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
important to us i think is really

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.870 
important to us i think is really
because<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.740> his<00:05:16.830> analytical<00:05:17.130> engine<00:05:17.730> not

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
because of his analytical engine not

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.100 
because of his analytical engine not
because<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> difference<00:05:18.570> engine<00:05:18.930> it's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
because of the difference engine it's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.500 
because of the difference engine it's
the<00:05:19.710> analytical<00:05:20.280> engine<00:05:20.370> that's<00:05:20.820> believed<00:05:21.420> to

the analytical engine that's believed to

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.140 
the analytical engine that's believed to

fundamental principles of a computer

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.490 
fundamental principles of a computer
that<00:05:26.160> we<00:05:26.820> have<00:05:27.090> today<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:28.050> here<00:05:28.290> you<00:05:28.470> have

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
that we have today so here you have

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.490 
that we have today so here you have
what's<00:05:28.980> known<00:05:29.580> as<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.240> mill<00:05:30.480> which<00:05:31.230> is<00:05:31.380> like

what's known as the mill which is like

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.340 
what's known as the mill which is like
the<00:05:31.530> processing<00:05:32.280> part<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.840> today's

the processing part of the of today's
computer<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.610> have<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:35.760> store<00:05:36.090> off<00:05:36.360> to

computer and you have a store off to

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.320 
computer and you have a store off to
this<00:05:36.810> side<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.800> you're<00:05:37.950> dividing<00:05:38.520> up<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.940> idea

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
this side so you're dividing up the idea

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.909 
this side so you're dividing up the idea
of<00:05:39.540> the<00:05:39.630> processor<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.500> idea<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.800> the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
memory and it's you know a major

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.490 
memory and it's you know a major
conceptual<00:05:44.430> leap<00:05:44.910> in<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.330> machine<00:05:45.690> you've<00:05:46.290> also

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
conceptual leap in a machine you've also

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.120 
conceptual leap in a machine you've also
got<00:05:46.860> some<00:05:47.419> input<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:48.660> output<00:05:49.320> devices<00:05:49.650> with

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
got some input and output devices with

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.510 
got some input and output devices with
the<00:05:50.250> punch<00:05:50.460> cards<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.180> were<00:05:51.419> used<00:05:52.160> and<00:05:53.160> it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
the punch cards that were used and it

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.370 
the punch cards that were used and it
was<00:05:53.640> also<00:05:53.880> capable<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.510> conditional

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
was also capable of conditional

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.710 
was also capable of conditional
branching<00:05:55.919> so<00:05:56.100> you<00:05:56.160> know<00:05:56.400> if<00:05:56.580> X<00:05:57.000> happens<00:05:57.419> then

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
branching so you know if X happens then

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.130 
branching so you know if X happens then
why<00:05:58.200> can<00:05:58.890> happen<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.400> you<00:05:59.970> know<00:06:00.030> it<00:06:00.570> was<00:06:00.810> you

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
why can happen and you know it was you

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.990 
why can happen and you know it was you

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
mechanize make a nice thought that was

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.700 
mechanize make a nice thought that was

various plans to do you know various

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.930 
various plans to do you know various
universities<00:06:20.190> have<00:06:20.400> approached<00:06:20.700> us<00:06:20.850> about

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
universities have approached us about

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.900 
universities have approached us about
doing<00:06:21.390> a<00:06:21.890> virtual<00:06:22.890> analytical<00:06:23.460> engine<00:06:23.790> and

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
doing a virtual analytical engine and

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.640 
doing a virtual analytical engine and
using<00:06:24.210> beverages<00:06:24.630> designs<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.350> see<00:06:25.500> whether

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
using beverages designs to see whether

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.550 
using beverages designs to see whether
that<00:06:25.860> would<00:06:26.010> be<00:06:26.100> possible<00:06:26.900> but<00:06:27.900> given<00:06:28.200> it<00:06:28.350> how

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
that would be possible but given it how
