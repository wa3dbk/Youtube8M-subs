okay it's time to remove our soft parts
from<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> injectors<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.750> slice<00:00:07.140> down

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
from the injectors on this slice down

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:24.120 
from the injectors on this slice down
each<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.690> pintle<00:00:09.960> caps<00:00:10.200> first

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.430 

pull<00:00:24.400> off<00:00:24.490> our<00:00:24.610> filter<00:00:25.240> spacers<00:00:25.930> and<00:00:26.110> caps

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
pull off our filter spacers and caps

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.510 
pull off our filter spacers and caps
from<00:00:26.740> bottom<00:00:27.400> first<00:00:28.950> I've<00:00:29.950> already<00:00:30.310> removed

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
from bottom first I've already removed

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.300 
from bottom first I've already removed
the<00:00:30.850> upper<00:00:31.380> over<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:32.560> I've<00:00:32.650> installed<00:00:33.010> it<00:00:33.220> on

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
the upper over and I've installed it on

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.700 
the upper over and I've installed it on
is<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.790> little<00:00:33.970> bit<00:00:34.210> larger<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.960> works<00:00:35.350> well

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
is a little bit larger that works well

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.530 
is a little bit larger that works well
in<00:00:35.950> our<00:00:36.570> manifold<00:00:37.570> for<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.900> flow<00:00:38.110> bench

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
in our manifold for the flow bench

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
in our manifold for the flow bench
that's<00:00:40.540> why<00:00:40.720> these<00:00:40.780> are<00:00:41.020> blue<00:00:41.230> on<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.530> top

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that's why these are blue on the top

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.880 
that's why these are blue on the top
we'll<00:00:42.790> leave<00:00:43.000> those<00:00:43.239> pawns<00:00:43.629> so<00:00:44.559> we're<00:00:44.739> done

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
we'll leave those pawns so we're done

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.710 
we'll leave those pawns so we're done
cleaning<00:00:45.220> we<00:00:45.430> can<00:00:45.640> test<00:00:46.059> these<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.480> bench

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
cleaning we can test these in the bench

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.140 
cleaning we can test these in the bench
and<00:00:47.320> we're<00:00:48.100> going<00:00:48.220> to<00:00:48.280> pull<00:00:48.520> these<00:00:48.700> filters

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
and we're going to pull these filters

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.000 
and we're going to pull these filters
out<00:00:49.390> there<00:00:50.110> are<00:00:50.170> some<00:00:50.320> special<00:00:50.500> tools<00:00:50.860> that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
out there are some special tools that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.369 
out there are some special tools that
are<00:00:51.100> available<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.879> it's<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.480> puller<00:00:52.809> with<00:00:53.350> a

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
are available that it's a puller with a

number kenchi metal screw in the puller

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.020 
number kenchi metal screw in the puller
and<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:56.890> clamps<00:00:57.280> over<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.580> injector<00:00:58.000> and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
and it clamps over the injector and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.570 
and it clamps over the injector and
yellow<00:00:58.239> handle<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.750> squeeze<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.650> it's

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the only problem with it is it doesn't

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.969 
the only problem with it is it doesn't
work<00:01:04.720> as<00:01:04.870> well<00:01:05.080> as<00:01:05.320> just<00:01:05.530> something<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:05.920> simple

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
into the filter rock it a little bit to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.899 
into the filter rock it a little bit to
loosen<00:01:16.960> up<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.080> first<00:01:17.650> ring<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.130> out<00:01:18.729> it

you want to pull these filters out at
home<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.780> put<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.590> bench<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
home just put this in the bench in the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.100 
home just put this in the bench in the
in<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:27.539> vise<00:01:28.539> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> bench

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:57.200 

it's<00:01:32.100> just

okay<00:01:58.799> doctors<00:01:59.799> are<00:01:59.950> out<00:02:00.240> doesn't<00:02:01.240> hurt<00:02:01.329> to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
okay doctors are out doesn't hurt to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.760 
okay doctors are out doesn't hurt to
take<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.570> look<00:02:01.659> at<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.899> filters<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.530> see<00:02:02.679> if

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
take a look at the filters and see if

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.679 
take a look at the filters and see if
what<00:02:03.189> kind<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.579> contamination<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.359> on<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
what kind of contamination is on the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.029 
what kind of contamination is on the
outside<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.350> filter<00:02:05.740> if<00:02:05.859> there's

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
outside of the filter if there's

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.740 
outside of the filter if there's
anything<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.520> there<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:07.179> might<00:02:07.390> want<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.630> look

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
anything on there you might want to look

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050 
anything on there you might want to look
down<00:02:07.990> into<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.679> bore<00:02:09.069> make<00:02:09.670> sure<00:02:09.849> that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
down into the bore make sure that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.020 
down into the bore make sure that
there's<00:02:10.269> no<00:02:10.420> corrosion<00:02:10.869> down<00:02:11.019> in<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.349> bore

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
there's no corrosion down in the bore

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530 
there's no corrosion down in the bore
this<00:02:13.030> looks<00:02:13.299> pretty<00:02:13.569> good<00:02:15.299> if<00:02:16.299> there's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this looks pretty good if there's

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.729 
this looks pretty good if there's
corrosion<00:02:16.900> down<00:02:17.019> there<00:02:17.260> gives<00:02:17.440> an<00:02:17.530> indication

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
corrosion down there gives an indication

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.920 
corrosion down there gives an indication
you<00:02:18.069> probably<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.760> internal<00:02:19.209> damage<00:02:19.360> deeper

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you probably have internal damage deeper

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.400 
you probably have internal damage deeper
in<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> injector<00:02:21.840> okay<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:22.900> we'll<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.260> these

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
in the injector okay so we'll get these

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.460 
in the injector okay so we'll get these
into<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.480> ultrasonic<00:02:25.480> cleaning<00:02:25.750> tank<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
into the ultrasonic cleaning tank on the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.050 
into the ultrasonic cleaning tank on the
machine<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.040> give<00:02:27.430> them<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> good<00:02:27.730> deep

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
machine and give them a good deep

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.510 
machine and give them a good deep
cleaning
