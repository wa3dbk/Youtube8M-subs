00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.860
 my five tips to choose the source 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.080
 of power of your PC number one know 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.420
 previously the equipment configuration 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.059
 be a new equipment one used is 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.430
 important to know what processor board 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.160
 video card memory and others 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.289
 devices does your equipment either 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.060
 you are going to assemble completely what 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.460
 have a configuration for 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.320
 repowering in this way we will know 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.140
 before sea â€‹â€‹what energy requirements 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.469
 consume and thus decide which source is more 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 convenient for our pc to 'number 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.190
 two ' previously stipulate the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.649
 budget that is going to be invested in the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.540
 pc configuration and needs 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.540
 that will supply this particular 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.430
 We always advise the same thing is vital 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.800
 that before making any purchase 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.230
 especially in technology that should be 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.899
 identify the need of each one in 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.360
 the purchase of computers since it is not 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.579
 the same a computer for a designer 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.879
 graphic that a team for a 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.070
 gamer or a systems engineer 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.500
 once the particular need is known 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.250
 you must stimulate a budget either 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.740
 for 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.130
 not totally or to improve it to 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.110
 As you need it number 3 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.050
 know the types of sources and their 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.630
 specifications in the market there are 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.060
 many references and font marks 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.880
 which sometimes makes it difficult for us 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.520
 choice for one or the other there are sources 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920
 certified modular sources sources 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.290
 real it is important that you know those 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.540
 concepts and so you understand what is the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.490
 difference between each of these in the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.860
 picture you can see the types of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.200
 certifications and their efficiencies but 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.660
 as this video is not about what 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.149
 are the technical specifications and the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.460
 existing certifications I invite you to 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.680
 that you read on the internet more on this topic 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.869
 I'm sure you will learn much more and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 you will have a better perception of what 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.280
 source is the ideal for your need in 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.400
 specific 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.470
 number 4 read reviews forums and benchmark 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.600
 current I consider it the best 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.700
 tool that the user has for 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.130
 determine what product is good 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.500
 quality as well as the opinions of others 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.660
 users in the forums with this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.970
 information you will have more tools 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.620
 to make a good decision in the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.050
 purchase of any article of 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.810
 technology 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.390
 number 5 the exact source for each 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.730
 team it is always important that each 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 configuration of a computer be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.740
 balanced the source of power is the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.140
 heart of the team for which it is vital 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.210
 for the stable operation of this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.100
 for this reason I consider it one of 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.500
 the points where the user less 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.960
 budget invests and more problems of 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.820
 stability generates so before 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.250
 buy a source think about what 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.410
 devices you have and which ones you want 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.950
 improve in the future to buy the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.950
 proper source 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.590
