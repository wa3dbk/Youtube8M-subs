00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
view now we have our base cabinet layout

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.580 
view now we have our base cabinet layout
our<00:02:10.130> elevation<00:02:11.130> done<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.580> us<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.690> quickly

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
our elevation done for us we can quickly

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.140 
our elevation done for us we can quickly
add<00:02:13.920> our<00:02:15.290> cross-sections

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.510 

stick<00:02:21.150> these<00:02:21.300> over<00:02:21.569> here<00:02:22.040> zoom<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.400> and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
stick these over here zoom in there and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.320 
stick these over here zoom in there and
there's<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.880> our<00:02:24.530> details<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.980> our<00:02:26.330> our

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330

so<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.990> actually<00:02:31.260> create<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> g-code<00:02:32.240> all

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
so now to actually create the g-code all

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.400 
so now to actually create the g-code all
I<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.540> do<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.959> parts<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:37.230> just

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I have to do is go to parts I'm just

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.949 
I have to do is go to parts I'm just
gonna<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.650> ahead<00:02:37.709> until<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.900> dxfout<00:02:41.959> we'll

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
gonna go ahead until it to dxfout we'll

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.420 
gonna go ahead until it to dxfout we'll
call<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:46.110> new<00:02:46.500> job<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.830> I'm<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
call this just new job and I'm going to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.660 
call this just new job and I'm going to
select<00:02:51.769> save<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:55.370> goes<00:02:56.370> through<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
select save here goes through and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
select save here goes through and
creates<00:02:57.000> all<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> Dix<00:02:57.450> F<00:02:57.630> part<00:02:57.930> from<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> our

about three minutes we have all the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.970 
about three minutes we have all the
cabinet<00:03:19.350> parts<00:03:19.560> done<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:21.530> bloom<00:03:22.530> drawer

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
cabinet parts done the bloom drawer

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
cabinet parts done the bloom drawer
slides<00:03:23.280> these<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.670> standard<00:03:24.030> drawer<00:03:24.209> slides

holes are holes my construction holes in
the<00:03:32.250> cabinets<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.700> stuff<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:33.570> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
the cabinets and stuff like that so the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.819 
the cabinets and stuff like that so the
only<00:03:33.660> thing<00:03:33.900> we<00:03:33.989> need<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.350> now<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.560> actually

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
only thing we need to do now to actually

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.100 
only thing we need to do now to actually
create<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.489> coat<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.570> go<00:03:36.750> quick

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
create the coat this so just go quick

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.840 
create the coat this so just go quick
code<00:03:39.200> one<00:03:40.200> tell<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> pause<00:03:40.860> until<00:03:41.579> it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
code one tell it to pause until it's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.240 
code one tell it to pause until it's
good<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.150> for<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> code<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:46.250> there's

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
good just for the code you know there's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.670 
good just for the code you know there's
all<00:03:47.430> our<00:03:47.519> og<00:03:47.640> code<00:03:48.109> with<00:03:49.109> all<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.380> our<00:03:49.440> boring

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
all our og code with all of our boring

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.319 
all our og code with all of our boring
patterns<00:03:50.130> done<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.489> stuff<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.060> for<00:03:51.269> us
