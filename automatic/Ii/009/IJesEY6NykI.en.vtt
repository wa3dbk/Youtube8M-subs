00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
serpentines you have to depend on the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.220 
serpentines you have to depend on the
ocean<00:00:15.650> with<00:00:16.100> time<00:00:16.340> too<00:00:16.580> many<00:00:16.760> waves<00:00:17.690> all<00:00:18.050> of

so<00:01:06.580> therefore<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.899> applications<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.740> two

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
so therefore the applications and two

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.359 
so therefore the applications and two
guys<00:01:09.070> are<00:01:09.240> using<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.360> end<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.600> more<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.899> more

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
guys are using the end up more and more

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.530 
guys are using the end up more and more
there's<00:01:12.369> nothing<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.030> really<00:01:13.060> had

boarding is a particular focus on core

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.999 
boarding is a particular focus on core
it's<00:01:47.040> integration<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.850> extremities<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
it's integration to the extremities and

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's integration to the extremities and
also<00:01:50.300> something<00:01:51.300> that's<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> become

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
also something that's going to become

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.690 
also something that's going to become
more<00:01:52.530> popular<00:01:52.860> than<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:54.180> people<00:01:54.540> talk<00:01:54.750> about

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
more popular than what people talk about

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.740 
more popular than what people talk about
it's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.820> posture<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.880> Reese<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.270> able<00:02:00.600> do

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
it's a posture and the Reese I'm able do

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
it's a posture and the Reese I'm able do
a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.050> what<00:02:01.289> I'm<00:02:01.410> doing<00:02:01.940> because<00:02:02.940> I'm

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
a lot of what I'm doing because I'm

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.900 
a lot of what I'm doing because I'm
keeping<00:02:05.869> correct<00:02:07.250> posture<00:02:08.250> through<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
keeping correct posture through the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.740 
keeping correct posture through the
movements<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.440> again<00:02:14.090> what<00:02:15.090> I'm<00:02:15.239> doing<00:02:15.570> isn't

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
movements so again what I'm doing isn't

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
particularly the type of stuff you do in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.820 
particularly the type of stuff you do in
learning<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.580> do<00:02:23.760> these<00:02:24.000> tricks<00:02:24.709> there's<00:02:25.709> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
learning to do these tricks there's a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.509 
learning to do these tricks there's a
certain<00:02:26.280> amount<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.820> core<00:02:27.090> activation<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
certain amount of core activation and

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:39.340 
certain amount of core activation and
exercise<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.760> comes<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.209> it
