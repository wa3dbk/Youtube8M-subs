is something that you'll find useful

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.589 
is something that you'll find useful
when<00:00:10.009> carving<00:00:10.250> pumpkins<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.059> other<00:00:11.240> hollow

when carving pumpkins and other hollow

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.329 
when carving pumpkins and other hollow
fruit<00:00:12.049> that<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:12.440> intend<00:00:12.799> to<00:00:12.889> light<00:00:13.160> from

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
fruit that you intend to light from

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.180 
fruit that you intend to light from
within<00:00:13.549> when<00:00:14.509> carving<00:00:14.809> a<00:00:15.079> pumpkin<00:00:15.320> lantern<00:00:16.010> or

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
within when carving a pumpkin lantern or

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.360 
within when carving a pumpkin lantern or
watermelon<00:00:17.180> Lantern<00:00:17.660> how<00:00:18.260> you<00:00:18.320> how<00:00:18.770> thick<00:00:19.160> you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
watermelon Lantern how you how thick you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.760 
watermelon Lantern how you how thick you
carve<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.910> fruit<00:00:20.180> or<00:00:20.360> the<00:00:20.420> rind<00:00:20.810> determines

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
carve the fruit or the rind determines

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.260 
carve the fruit or the rind determines
how<00:00:21.980> much<00:00:22.190> light<00:00:22.430> passes<00:00:22.940> through<00:00:22.970> it

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
how much light passes through it

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.110 
how much light passes through it
determines<00:00:24.050> areas<00:00:24.530> of<00:00:24.770> light<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:25.220> dark<00:00:25.460> so

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
determines areas of light and dark so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.090 
determines areas of light and dark so
I'm<00:00:26.480> going<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:26.690> demonstrate<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.470> concept<00:00:28.010> so

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
I'm going to demonstrate that concept so

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.960 
I'm going to demonstrate that concept so
that<00:00:28.250> you<00:00:28.310> have<00:00:28.430> a<00:00:28.460> little<00:00:28.670> bit<00:00:28.820> better

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
that you have a little bit better

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.090 
that you have a little bit better
understanding<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.900> it<00:00:30.050> here's<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.650> pumpkin

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
understanding of it here's a pumpkin

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.490 
understanding of it here's a pumpkin
that<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.280> created<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:32.360> demonstrates<00:00:33.289> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
that I created that demonstrates the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.670 
that I created that demonstrates the
concept<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:34.219> I'm<00:00:34.340> trying<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.700> express<00:00:35.320> so<00:00:36.320> we

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
concept that I'm trying to express so we

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.530 
concept that I'm trying to express so we
have<00:00:36.860> varying<00:00:37.370> amounts<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.940> light<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.180> dark

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
have varying amounts of light and dark

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.420 
have varying amounts of light and dark
the<00:00:38.810> darkest<00:00:39.290> thing<00:00:39.380> we're<00:00:39.680> going<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.920> see<00:00:40.190> is

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
the darkest thing we're going to see is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.410 
the darkest thing we're going to see is
this<00:00:41.060> black<00:00:41.390> line<00:00:41.720> what<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.020> did<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:42.470> actually

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
this black line what I did is I actually

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.069 
this black line what I did is I actually
painted<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.540> with<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:45.590> black<00:00:46.430> marker<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.750> if

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
painted that with a black marker so if

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.380 
painted that with a black marker so if
you<00:00:48.170> want<00:00:48.380> dark<00:00:48.770> dark<00:00:49.250> areas<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:49.880> can<00:00:50.060> do<00:00:50.210> that

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
you want dark dark areas you can do that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.540 
you want dark dark areas you can do that
the<00:00:50.750> next<00:00:50.780> darkest<00:00:51.500> area<00:00:51.829> we're<00:00:52.010> going<00:00:52.220> to<00:00:52.340> see

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the next darkest area we're going to see

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.299 
the next darkest area we're going to see
are<00:00:52.970> all<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.420> areas<00:00:53.780> where<00:00:54.020> I<00:00:54.079> left<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.010> skin

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
are all the areas where I left the skin

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.819 
are all the areas where I left the skin
intact<00:00:55.790> after<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.140> next<00:00:57.440> lightest

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
intact after that the next lightest

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.220 
intact after that the next lightest
areas<00:00:58.280> are<00:00:58.730> going<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.180> be<00:00:59.270> these<00:00:59.540> areas<00:00:59.989> where

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
areas are going to be these areas where

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.260 
areas are going to be these areas where
the<00:01:00.440> skins<00:01:00.710> been<00:01:00.890> peeled<00:01:01.219> away<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.120> it's

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
the skins been peeled away but it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.469 
the skins been peeled away but it's
still<00:01:02.540> thick<00:01:02.930> then<00:01:03.800> what<00:01:03.950> I<00:01:03.980> did<00:01:04.309> these<00:01:04.670> spaces

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
still thick then what I did these spaces

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.140 
still thick then what I did these spaces
in<00:01:05.960> between<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.770> carved<00:01:07.640> them<00:01:07.820> deep<00:01:08.600> like<00:01:09.080> deep

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
in between I carved them deep like deep

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.820 
in between I carved them deep like deep
squares<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.990> reason<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.350> did<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.650> is

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
squares and the reason I did that is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.100 
squares and the reason I did that is
because<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.310> want<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.850> see<00:01:14.060> once<00:01:14.360> it's<00:01:14.750> lit

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
because I want you to see once it's lit

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.930 
because I want you to see once it's lit
how<00:01:15.680> much<00:01:15.860> more<00:01:16.100> light<00:01:16.310> comes<00:01:16.610> through<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
how much more light comes through the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.840 
how much more light comes through the
center<00:01:17.840> where<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.260> thinner<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:19.580> it

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
center where it's thinner and it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.390 
center where it's thinner and it
gradually<00:01:20.360> less<00:01:20.900> light<00:01:21.140> comes<00:01:21.710> through<00:01:22.040> as<00:01:22.250> it

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
gradually less light comes through as it

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.830 
gradually less light comes through as it
reaches<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.729> edge<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.119> these<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:23.750> you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
reaches the edge of these and then you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.390 
reaches the edge of these and then you
can<00:01:23.990> see<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.290> less<00:01:24.560> light<00:01:24.860> comes<00:01:25.159> through

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
can see that less light comes through

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490 
can see that less light comes through
this<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:25.850> once<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:26.720> lit<00:01:26.960> you'll<00:01:27.170> see<00:01:27.380> what

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
this so once it's lit you'll see what

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.820 
this so once it's lit you'll see what
I'm<00:01:27.590> talking<00:01:27.979> about<00:01:28.040> then<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.810> course<00:01:30.440> the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
I'm talking about then of course the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.740 
I'm talking about then of course the
most<00:01:31.040> light<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.850> going<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.060> pass<00:01:32.270> through<00:01:32.600> any

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
most light is going to pass through any

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.340 
most light is going to pass through any
area<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.860> carve<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.700> way<00:01:34.820> through

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
area that you carve all the way through

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.590 
area that you carve all the way through
around<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:36.530> open<00:01:36.770> heart<00:01:37.220> I've<00:01:38.119> carved<00:01:38.450> with

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
around this open heart I've carved with

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.570 
around this open heart I've carved with
a<00:01:38.689> V<00:01:38.840> cutter<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.350> around<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.860> heart<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.280> again

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
a V cutter all around the heart so again

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.640 
a V cutter all around the heart so again
that<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:41.030> see<00:01:41.330> how<00:01:42.110> that's<00:01:42.320> going<00:01:42.560> to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that you can see how that's going to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.280 
that you can see how that's going to
look<00:01:42.710> once<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:43.310> lit<00:01:43.549> from<00:01:43.700> within<00:01:44.110> now<00:01:45.110> let

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
look once it's lit from within now let

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.810 
look once it's lit from within now let
me<00:01:45.409> show<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.590> how<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.040> looks<00:01:46.100> with<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
me show you how this looks with the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.370 
me show you how this looks with the
light<00:01:46.970> inside<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.600> you'll<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:47.960> what<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.140> mean

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
light inside and you'll see what I mean

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.499 
light inside and you'll see what I mean
this<00:01:48.920> isn't<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.280> prettiest<00:01:49.700> pumpkin<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.390> way

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
this isn't the prettiest pumpkin the way

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.600 
this isn't the prettiest pumpkin the way
it<00:01:50.659> looks<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.350> full<00:01:51.530> daylight<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.400> once

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
it looks in the full daylight but once

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.310 
it looks in the full daylight but once
the<00:01:52.790> lights<00:01:52.970> coming<00:01:53.270> through<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.659> you'll<00:01:54.080> see

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the lights coming through it you'll see

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.050 
the lights coming through it you'll see
what<00:01:54.439> I'm<00:01:54.530> talking<00:01:54.560> about<00:01:54.920> how<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.369> varying

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
what I'm talking about how the varying

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.690 
what I'm talking about how the varying
depth<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:57.020> how<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.200> carve<00:01:57.619> determines<00:01:58.549> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
depth of how you carve determines the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
depth of how you carve determines the
amount<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:59.000> light<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.420> comes<00:01:59.630> through<00:01:59.840> it

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
amount of light that comes through it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.990 
amount of light that comes through it
which<00:02:00.590> determines<00:02:01.070> how<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.250> looks<00:02:01.549> once<00:02:01.790> it's

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
which determines how it looks once it's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.170 
which determines how it looks once it's
lit<00:02:02.240> let's<00:02:02.930> take<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> look<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.610> looks<00:02:04.880> really

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
lit let's take a look this looks really

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.300 
lit let's take a look this looks really
pretty<00:02:05.299> once<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:05.990> lit<00:02:06.200> doesn't<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.740> now

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
pretty once it's lit doesn't it now

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.160 
pretty once it's lit doesn't it now
obviously<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.119> most<00:02:08.149> amount<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:08.780> light<00:02:08.959> is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
obviously the most amount of light is

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.719 
obviously the most amount of light is
going<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.439> pass<00:02:09.649> through<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.099> center<00:02:10.459> heart

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to pass through the center heart

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
going to pass through the center heart
where<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.510> cut<00:02:11.750> all<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.170> way<00:02:12.260> through<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
where it's cut all the way through and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.860 
where it's cut all the way through and
then<00:02:13.610> you'll<00:02:13.760> notice<00:02:13.970> where<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.300> had<00:02:14.510> made<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
then you'll notice where I had made the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.570 
then you'll notice where I had made the
V<00:02:15.050> cuts<00:02:15.380> around<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.310> edge

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
V cuts around the edge

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
V cuts around the edge
of<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.350> heart<00:02:18.350> right<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.860> center<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
of that heart right in the center and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.880 
of that heart right in the center and
you<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.360> deeper<00:02:20.720> areas<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.680> V

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
you can see the deeper areas of the V

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.910 
you can see the deeper areas of the V
have<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.970> light<00:02:23.180> coming<00:02:23.540> through<00:02:23.570> them<00:02:23.960> when

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
have more light coming through them when

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.520 
have more light coming through them when
you<00:02:25.040> look<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.520> outside<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.510> heart<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you look just outside of that heart you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.990 
you look just outside of that heart you
see<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.890> scalloped<00:02:28.430> edge<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.970> that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
see the scalloped edge and that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.180 
see the scalloped edge and that
scalloped<00:02:29.840> edge<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.260> where<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.500> went<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.950> little

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
scalloped edge is where I went a little

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.790 
scalloped edge is where I went a little
bit<00:02:31.430> deeper<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.140> little<00:02:33.380> bit<00:02:33.530> lighter

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
bit deeper so it's a little bit lighter

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.690 
bit deeper so it's a little bit lighter
than<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.400> part<00:02:35.210> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.810> heart<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:37.040> inside

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
than the part of the heart just inside

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.570 
than the part of the heart just inside
those<00:02:37.970> scallops<00:02:38.480> just<00:02:39.410> outside<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.130> scallops

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
those scallops just outside the scallops

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.520 
those scallops just outside the scallops
you'll<00:02:40.790> notice<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.300> quite<00:02:41.480> dark<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.050> that's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
you'll notice it's quite dark and that's

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.190 
you'll notice it's quite dark and that's
where<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.800> left<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.820> skin<00:02:44.120> intact<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.900> didn't

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
where I left the skin intact I didn't

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.640 
where I left the skin intact I didn't
peel<00:02:45.470> away<00:02:45.740> any<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:47.360> if<00:02:47.690> you<00:02:48.110> look<00:02:48.350> at<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
peel away any then if you look at the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.680 
peel away any then if you look at the
surrounding<00:02:49.370> heart<00:02:49.700> around<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.300> where<00:02:50.510> I've

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
surrounding heart around that where I've

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.020 
surrounding heart around that where I've
got<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.050> squares<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.640> how<00:02:52.970> the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
got the squares you can see how the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.870 
got the squares you can see how the
depth<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.440> carving<00:02:54.950> determines<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
depth of the carving determines the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.300 
depth of the carving determines the
amount<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.209> lightness<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.020> darkness<00:02:57.440> that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
amount of lightness and darkness that

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.949 
amount of lightness and darkness that
shows<00:02:58.550> through<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.209> see<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.570> center

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
shows through so you can see the center

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.780 
shows through so you can see the center
of<00:03:00.080> each<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> those<00:03:00.620> deep<00:03:00.860> squares<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.550> lighter

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
of each of those deep squares is lighter

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.220 
of each of those deep squares is lighter
than<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.120> outside<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.750> each<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.110> those

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
than the outside of each of those

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.640 
than the outside of each of those
squares<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.920> then<00:03:04.640> alternately<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:06.200> can<00:03:06.380> see

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
squares and then alternately you can see

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.070 
squares and then alternately you can see
that<00:03:07.010> squares<00:03:07.520> where<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:07.880> only<00:03:08.300> shave<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.930> skin

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
that squares where I only shave the skin

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.820 
that squares where I only shave the skin
off<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.650> those<00:03:10.370> are<00:03:10.580> darker<00:03:11.140> now<00:03:12.140> surrounding

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
off and those are darker now surrounding

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850 
off and those are darker now surrounding
that<00:03:12.860> we've<00:03:13.400> got<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.090> area<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.170> had<00:03:15.530> drawn

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
that we've got the area that I had drawn

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.620 
that we've got the area that I had drawn
on<00:03:16.100> with<00:03:16.370> magic<00:03:16.880> marker

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
on with magic marker

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.130 
on with magic marker
that's<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:19.070> darkest<00:03:19.520> area<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:20.959> outside

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
that's the darkest area and then outside

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.370 
that's the darkest area and then outside
of<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.739> we've<00:03:22.310> got<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:23.150> pumpkin<00:03:24.019> with<00:03:24.230> its

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
of that we've got the pumpkin with its

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.770 
of that we've got the pumpkin with its
skin<00:03:24.620> intact<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.430> light<00:03:25.610> areas<00:03:26.030> are<00:03:26.330> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
skin intact and the light areas are the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.449 
skin intact and the light areas are the
areas<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.350> carved<00:03:27.769> away<00:03:27.860> using<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.310> V

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
areas that I carved away using a V

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.240 
areas that I carved away using a V
cutter<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.930> that's<00:03:30.080> how<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.320> can<00:03:30.560> control<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
cutter so that's how you can control the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.890 
cutter so that's how you can control the
lightness<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.790> darkness<00:03:32.090> when<00:03:32.780> you're

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
lightness and darkness when you're

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140 
lightness and darkness when you're
carving<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.500> pumpkin<00:03:33.680> lantern<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.519> once<00:03:35.000> you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
carving a pumpkin lantern and once you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.360 
carving a pumpkin lantern and once you
understand<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:35.810> concept<00:03:36.050> you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.950> use<00:03:37.220> it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
understand this concept you can use it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.759 
understand this concept you can use it
for<00:03:37.489> simple<00:03:37.940> designs<00:03:38.300> like<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.650> instance

didn't<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.400> what<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.550> did<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.880> I

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030

it's significantly thinner than the rest
this<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.650> all<00:04:07.040> about<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.209> thick<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:10.280> as

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you can see is only this thick so once I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.890 
you can see is only this thick so once I
