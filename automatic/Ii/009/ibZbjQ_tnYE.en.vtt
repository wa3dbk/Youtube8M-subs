00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.189
 presentation video for the new 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.369
 tournament we organized that is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 it was actually made by home that with 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 I already made some collaborations 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.530
 surely you will remember him and da 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 spaak regarding the graphics 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 ie the fifa spring cup 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 I tell you right away that it will be a tournament 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 composed of four yes from 4 from 8 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.610
 youtuber 38 youtuber review in the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 screen right now so I am 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.969
 home david mpx of p 17 rudy zlatan god 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.359
 federico marconi speck trash and ex set 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.460
 these nuper actors we will go to challenge 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 nor, obviously, of the games 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.700
 ultimate team following the rules of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 upgrade and downgrade from note 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.439
 break down by wins and losses 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 draws and delivered right now 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.130
 on the graphics you see these rules 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 at first he could observe me 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 complex but in reality there is nothing 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.159
 so hard 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 simply for each victory 5 points 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.900
 upgrade of visible between all 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.960
 so you can increase five players 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 players of one or a player of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.700
 52 players 1 from three and 1 from 2 like 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 you want us as we would like in this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 case for every draw three points always 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.890
 divided customers into 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.100
 team 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 for every defeat instead it goes from a 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.970
 heritage of te putin 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.670
 moreover for every delivered we have a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.759
 plus point so if I had to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.130
 win 4 0 for example a game or 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.259
 five points of victory over 4 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.909
 points of goals for a total of nine 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.040
 points to be divided by means and I see 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.680
 which also to be assigned 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.950
 to a player only in regards to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.300
 instead the teams the teams must 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.270
 follow can be what you see 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.940
 now or maximum evaluation of the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.580
 team must be 75 all players 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.950
 on the bench equal to 70 then silver 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.710
 70 while the players on the field must 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 vary from 75 to 79 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.130
 so obviously they can't be 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 all 79 otherwise the evaluation 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.980
 team spores 75 right now there 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.150
 I will also show my team in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 this video will show you mine 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.150
 team that we say there are a moment 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.440
 harebrained to do it but mixed ie i 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.240
 looks pretty good unfortunately not 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.490
 yet proven I'll show you in 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.320
 this moment this team that 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.490
 I think it has potential 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.230
 especially with regards to 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.390
 in short, the attack is nothing I remember you 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.170
