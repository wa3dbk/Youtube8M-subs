00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
for doors and through lights so only two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
for doors and through lights so only two
doors<00:02:01.469> got<00:02:01.680> lights<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.189> them<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.880> these

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
doors got lights on them and on these

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
doors got lights on them and on these
stories<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.229> symbols<00:02:04.799> for

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
stories you can see some symbols for

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.980 
stories you can see some symbols for
example<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> web<00:02:05.969> rededges<00:02:06.329> showed<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.840> guys

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
example the web rededges showed you guys

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 
example the web rededges showed you guys
and<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.860> few<00:02:08.220> others

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and a few others

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.969 
and a few others
was<00:02:09.240> as<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.440> really

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
was as well and this is really

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.059 
was as well and this is really
interesting<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.850> what<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.860> to

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
interesting because what if we have to

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.850 
interesting because what if we have to
find<00:02:14.370> all<00:02:14.640> four<00:02:15.120> symbols<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.900> order<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
find all four symbols in order to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.370 
find all four symbols in order to
trigger<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.550> light<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.120> third<00:02:18.569> door<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
trigger the light of the third door and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.350 
trigger the light of the third door and
do<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.830> same<00:02:20.069> with<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> last<00:02:20.730> door<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.060> course

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
do the same with the last door of course

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.990 
do the same with the last door of course
and<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> observatory<00:02:23.040> opens<00:02:23.610> up<00:02:23.790> or

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and then the observatory opens up or

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.229 
and then the observatory opens up or
something<00:02:24.780> happens<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.819> sounds<00:02:27.030> a

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
something happens I know it sounds a

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.059 
something happens I know it sounds a
little<00:02:27.510> bit<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> fetch<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.709> totally

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
little bit for a fetch and I totally

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.449 
little bit for a fetch and I totally
agree<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.819> we<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:30.540> forget<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.680> found<00:02:32.040> better

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
agree but we all forget we found better

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.870 
agree but we all forget we found better
is<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:33.030> crack<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.290> observatory<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.640> can

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
is a crack in the observatory and we can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.270 
is a crack in the observatory and we can
even<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> game<00:02:37.050> files<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.950> what

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
even see this in the game files so what

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.610 
even see this in the game files so what
if<00:02:38.520> all<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.360> something<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.170> with

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
if all this has something to do with

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.100 
if all this has something to do with
each<00:02:40.920> other<00:02:41.250> find<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.120> symbols<00:02:42.570> Drago

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
each other find the symbols Drago

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.590 
each other find the symbols Drago
delights<00:02:43.530> open<00:02:44.310> up<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> doors<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> something

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
delights open up the doors and something

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.259 
delights open up the doors and something
happens<00:02:46.140> with<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> observatory<00:02:47.340> as<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:48.030> nice

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
happens with the observatory as a nice

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.020 
happens with the observatory as a nice
rack<00:02:48.570> think<00:02:48.989> about<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.830> only<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
rack think about it we can only see the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.100 
rack think about it we can only see the
web<00:02:51.360> from<00:02:51.660> 1<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.500> 2<00:02:52.769> a.m.<00:02:53.420> maybe<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.720> was<00:02:54.930> in

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
web from 1 to 2 a.m. maybe this was in

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.320 
web from 1 to 2 a.m. maybe this was in
the<00:02:55.140> game<00:02:55.440> from<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> beginning<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:56.940> because

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the game from the beginning but because

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.780 
the game from the beginning but because
it<00:02:57.540> has<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> time<00:02:58.230> limit<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.430> spawns

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
it has a time limit because it spawns

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.259 
it has a time limit because it spawns
from<00:03:00.030> 1<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.510> 2<00:03:00.720> a.m.<00:03:00.830> only<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:02.280> never<00:03:02.700> saw<00:03:03.239> it

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
from 1 to 2 a.m. only we never saw it

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.930 
from 1 to 2 a.m. only we never saw it
before<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.380> might<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.069> same<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
before and this might be the same with a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.660 
before and this might be the same with a
bunch<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.569> other<00:03:07.140> easter<00:03:07.769> egg<00:03:07.920> /<00:03:08.190> mystery

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
bunch of other easter egg / mystery

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.660 
bunch of other easter egg / mystery
related<00:03:09.510> stuff<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.319> game<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.220> ask<00:03:11.400> me

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
related stuff in the game if you ask me

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120 
related stuff in the game if you ask me
I<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.850> we<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.540> find<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.200> many<00:03:13.440> other<00:03:13.769> stuff

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
I think we can find so many other stuff

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.640 
I think we can find so many other stuff
what<00:03:14.370> only<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.850> visible<00:03:15.390> between<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:16.049> specific

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
what only is visible between a specific

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.460 
what only is visible between a specific
time<00:03:16.950> limit<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.610> yeah<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.030> hunt<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.510> not<00:03:18.930> over

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
time limit so yeah the hunt is not over

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.890 
time limit so yeah the hunt is not over
yet<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.950> sure<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.579> that's<00:03:20.700> basically<00:03:21.030> where

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
yet for sure and that's basically where

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.350 
yet for sure and that's basically where
the<00:03:21.959> series<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.680> but<00:03:23.040> finding<00:03:23.670> new<00:03:23.850> Easter

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the series is but finding new Easter

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.810 
the series is but finding new Easter
eggs<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.750> stuff<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.560> course<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.370> yeah<00:03:26.579> what

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
eggs and stuff of course but yeah what

do you guys think of this interesting

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.789 
do you guys think of this interesting
and<00:03:28.980> weird<00:03:29.489> black<00:03:30.180> spiderweb<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.410> only

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
and weird black spiderweb what only

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.729 
and weird black spiderweb what only
spawns<00:03:32.100> between<00:03:32.820> 1<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.360> 2<00:03:33.540> a.m.<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.590> what
