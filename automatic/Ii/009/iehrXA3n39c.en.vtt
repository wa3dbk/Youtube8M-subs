welcome<00:00:05.950> to<00:00:06.100> the<00:00:06.160> necklace<00:00:06.550> 11<00:00:06.940> x12

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
welcome to the necklace 11 x12

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.180 
welcome to the necklace 11 x12
technology<00:00:07.900> today<00:00:08.260> I'd<00:00:08.470> like<00:00:08.620> to<00:00:08.740> compare<00:00:09.040> the

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
technology today I'd like to compare the

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.980 
technology today I'd like to compare the
Intel<00:00:09.580> i5<00:00:09.780> 4690k<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:11.980> AMD<00:00:12.430> FX<00:00:12.580> 95<00:00:13.270> 90<00:00:13.780> and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
Intel i5 4690k with the AMD FX 95 90 and

Intel i5 4690k with the AMD FX 95 90 and
FX<00:00:14.740> 8350<00:00:15.610> processors<00:00:16.450> but<00:00:17.110> now<00:00:17.320> let's<00:00:17.650> jump

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
FX 8350 processors but now let's jump

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:50.590 
FX 8350 processors but now let's jump
straight<00:00:18.369> into<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.820> benchmarks

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:09.690 

you

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.970 

first<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.940> all<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.600> are<00:01:11.870> some<00:01:12.170> pretty<00:01:12.620> good

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
first of all these are some pretty good

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.040 
first of all these are some pretty good
processors<00:01:13.670> that's<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.480> sure

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
processors that's for sure

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.900 
processors that's for sure
we<00:01:15.380> don't<00:01:15.620> really<00:01:15.980> have<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.160> clear<00:01:16.460> winner<00:01:16.790> here

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
we don't really have a clear winner here

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.030 
we don't really have a clear winner here
when<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.720> comes<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.080> video<00:01:18.320> encoding<00:01:18.890> and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
when it comes to video encoding and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.510 
when it comes to video encoding and
specific<00:01:19.670> rendering<00:01:20.180> tasks<00:01:20.660> both<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.860> ami<00:01:22.040> FX

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
specific rendering tasks both the ami FX

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.500 
specific rendering tasks both the ami FX
95<00:01:22.970> 90<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.600> FX<00:01:24.290> 8350<00:01:24.979> outperformed<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.060> i5

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
95 90 and FX 8350 outperformed the i5

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.950 
95 90 and FX 8350 outperformed the i5
4690k<00:01:27.550> however<00:01:28.550> that's<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.300> always<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.840> case

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
4690k however that's not always the case

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.200 
4690k however that's not always the case
as<00:01:30.380> you've<00:01:30.560> seen<00:01:30.800> in<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> Adobe<00:01:31.490> Premiere<00:01:32.180> Pro

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
as you've seen in the Adobe Premiere Pro

as you've seen in the Adobe Premiere Pro
test<00:01:32.840> for<00:01:33.050> example<00:01:33.160> when<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.280> comes<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.610> gaming

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
test for example when it comes to gaming

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.719 
test for example when it comes to gaming
though<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.570> i-5<00:01:35.990> really<00:01:36.800> really<00:01:37.310> leaves<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
though the i-5 really really leaves the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.930 
though the i-5 really really leaves the
FX<00:01:38.090> CPUs<00:01:38.540> behind<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.380> simply<00:01:40.160> performs<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
FX CPUs behind it simply performs so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.240 
FX CPUs behind it simply performs so
much<00:01:41.119> better<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.690> games<00:01:42.020> than<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.830> FX

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
much better in games than the FX

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.150 
much better in games than the FX
processors<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.450> FX<00:01:44.780> 95<00:01:45.259> 90<00:01:45.649> doesn't<00:01:46.009> have<00:01:46.130> a

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
processors the FX 95 90 doesn't have a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.310 
processors the FX 95 90 doesn't have a
very<00:01:46.430> good<00:01:46.610> price<00:01:46.820> performance<00:01:47.119> ratio<00:01:47.479> but

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
very good price performance ratio but

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.120 
very good price performance ratio but
the<00:01:48.410> FX<00:01:48.740> 8350<00:01:49.869> definitely<00:01:50.869> does<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.680> costs

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
the FX 8350 definitely does it costs

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.480 
the FX 8350 definitely does it costs
less<00:01:52.310> than<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.640> i5<00:01:53.060> 4690k<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.440> in<00:01:54.890> specific

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
less than the i5 4690k and in specific

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.660 
less than the i5 4690k and in specific
aspects<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.390> performs<00:01:57.140> much<00:01:57.410> better<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:58.009> can't

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
aspects it performs much better I can't

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.639 
aspects it performs much better I can't
really<00:01:58.850> say<00:01:59.119> which<00:01:59.360> processor<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.350> winner

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
really say which processor is the winner

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.550 
really say which processor is the winner
here<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.160> all<00:02:01.550> depends<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.180> your<00:02:02.450> needs<00:02:02.720> in<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
here it all depends on your needs in the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.950 
here it all depends on your needs in the
end<00:02:03.649> it's<00:02:03.860> your<00:02:03.920> choice<00:02:04.399> not<00:02:04.700> mine<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.630> decide

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
end it's your choice not mine you decide

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.779 
end it's your choice not mine you decide
which<00:02:06.229> one's<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.619> winner<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.100> hope<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.610> could

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
which one's the winner I hope I could

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.669 
which one's the winner I hope I could
help<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.090> out<00:02:08.270> with<00:02:08.509> your<00:02:08.570> decision<00:02:09.350> somehow

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
help you out with your decision somehow
