lot of photographs and that's assuming I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.619

do<00:01:02.309> keep<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.000> photographs<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.570> do

do keep all of your photographs or do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.910 
do keep all of your photographs or do
you<00:01:03.690> throw<00:01:03.840> any<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.290> tend<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> keep<00:01:04.710> them

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you throw any way I tend to keep them

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.950 
you throw any way I tend to keep them
yeah<00:01:05.070> partly<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.600> too<00:01:06.720> much

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
yeah partly because it's just too much

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510 
yeah partly because it's just too much
work<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> filter<00:01:07.500> through<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
work to filter through them so I just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
work to filter through them so I just
get<00:01:08.670> bigger<00:01:08.850> drives<00:01:09.180> every<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.600> they<00:01:09.720> come

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
get bigger drives every time they come

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
get bigger drives every time they come
out<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.640> lightroom<00:01:11.640> isn't<00:01:12.150> Photoshop<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
out so lightroom isn't Photoshop it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.690 
out so lightroom isn't Photoshop it's
like<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> compliment<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> photoshop<00:01:14.189> yeah<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
like a compliment to photoshop yeah it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
like a compliment to photoshop yeah it's
it<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.720> Lightroom<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.470> its<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it is what Lightroom is is its think of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.980 
it is what Lightroom is is its think of
it<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> photo<00:01:17.729> editor<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.780> for

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it as a photo editor just for

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
it as a photo editor just for
photography<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:20.100> doesn't<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> text<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> can't

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
photography it doesn't do text you can't

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.999 
photography it doesn't do text you can't
you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> stuff<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:22.920> do

and tweaks to your pictures you can do

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.490 
and tweaks to your pictures you can do
slideshows<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.260> know

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
slideshows you know

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200 
slideshows you know
with<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.710> printers<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.490> has<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.880> robust

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
with the printers it has a really robust

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.850 
with the printers it has a really robust
printing<00:02:15.600> part<00:02:15.810> 2<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.140> made<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.380> print<00:02:16.800> on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
printing part 2 it's made to print on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.260 
printing part 2 it's made to print on
those<00:02:16.980> big<00:02:17.100> format<00:02:17.400> printers<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.880> stuff<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
those big format printers and stuff I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.880 
those big format printers and stuff I
like<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.810> thought<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> little<00:02:19.710> bit<00:02:19.800> more

about the develop panel what's going on
there<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> develop<00:02:22.440> panel<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.920> pretty

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
there well the develop panel is pretty

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.260 
there well the develop panel is pretty
cool<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> lot<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.120> your

of stuff the coolest part of it in terms

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.030 
of stuff the coolest part of it in terms
of<00:02:33.630> lightroom<00:02:33.930> 3<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.410> they<00:02:34.530> added<00:02:34.770> two

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
of lightroom 3 what they added two

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.610 
of lightroom 3 what they added two
things<00:02:35.310> noise<00:02:36.000> reduction<00:02:36.440> noise<00:02:37.440> reduction

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
things noise reduction noise reduction

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
things noise reduction noise reduction
they<00:02:37.860> had<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.280> earlier<00:02:38.880> versions<00:02:39.030> lightroom

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
they had in earlier versions lightroom

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
they had in earlier versions lightroom
but<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.780> sucked<00:02:41.540> turn<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:43.020> fat<00:02:43.410> basically<00:02:44.190> it

but it sucked turn your fat basically it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.250 
but it sucked turn your fat basically it
was<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> noise<00:02:45.090> reduction<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.630> much<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.110> was

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
was a noise reduction so much as it was

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.750 
was a noise reduction so much as it was
sort<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> posterizing<00:02:47.280> right<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.610> for

and<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.860> lens<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.520> noise<00:03:00.090> reduction<00:03:00.270> now

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and so the lens the noise reduction now

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.300 
and so the lens the noise reduction now
works<00:03:00.780> pretty<00:03:00.930> well<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.770> allows<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.220> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
works pretty well it allows you to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.630 
works pretty well it allows you to
pretty<00:03:02.700> significantly<00:03:03.360> tweak<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.430> number

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
pretty significantly tweak in a number

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.040 
pretty significantly tweak in a number
of<00:03:05.670> different<00:03:05.760> ways<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.270> one<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> can

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
of different ways for one thing you can

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.430 
of different ways for one thing you can
do<00:03:07.230> things<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.600> let's<00:03:10.020> say<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.410> of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
do things like not just let's say one of

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.300 
do things like not just let's say one of
the<00:03:10.560> things<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.770> noise<00:03:10.950> reduction<00:03:11.100> you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the things about noise reduction you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.410 
the things about noise reduction you
talk<00:03:11.459> about<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.670> posterization<00:03:12.000> removes

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
talk about the posterization removes

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.690 
talk about the posterization removes
detail<00:03:12.750> right<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.200> decrease<00:03:13.920> note<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.550> allows

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
detail right you decrease note so allows

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
detail right you decrease note so allows
you<00:03:14.820> sort<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.060> tweak<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.420> has<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> detail

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
you sort of tweak that has a detail

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.390 
you sort of tweak that has a detail
slider<00:03:16.410> allows<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.800> kind<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.250> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
slider allows you kind of take that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.729 
slider allows you kind of take that
compromise<00:03:18.000> fits<00:03:18.570> exactly<00:03:18.900> doesn't<00:03:19.500> everyone

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
compromise fits exactly doesn't everyone

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.220 
compromise fits exactly doesn't everyone
love<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> film<00:03:20.430> grain<00:03:20.730> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.299> effect<00:03:21.660> well

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
love the film grain kind of effect well

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.020 
love the film grain kind of effect well
there's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.620> film<00:03:22.860> grain<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.370> there's<00:03:23.519> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
there's a film grain and there's you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.640 
there's a film grain and there's you
know<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.330> color<00:03:24.570> noise<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.440> ugly

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
know the color noise which I really ugly

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.250 
know the color noise which I really ugly
so<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.580> basically<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.870> real-time

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
so so basically it is it so real-time

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660 
so so basically it is it so real-time
preview<00:03:28.560> allows<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.220> kind<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.430> store<00:03:29.580> like

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
preview allows you to kind of store like

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.009 
preview allows you to kind of store like

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
shall be stopped but what's going on in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.039 
shall be stopped but what's going on in
terms<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:56.060> they<00:03:57.060> had<00:03:57.180> lens<00:03:57.420> correction<00:03:57.930> is

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
terms of they had lens correction is

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.390 
terms of they had lens correction is
that<00:03:58.170> new<00:03:58.290> also<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.739> headlines<00:03:59.070> correction

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that new also the headlines correction

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.770 
that new also the headlines correction
before<00:03:59.700> they've<00:04:00.030> had<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> lot<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.480> manual

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
before they've had a lot of manual

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.330 
before they've had a lot of manual
tweaks<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.320> lens<00:04:01.500> correction<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.160> can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
tweaks to the lens correction so you can

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.880 
tweaks to the lens correction so you can
do<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.970> lot<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.480> trent<00:04:03.750> what<00:04:03.989> transforms<00:04:04.739> now

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
do a lot of trent what transforms now

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.620 
do a lot of trent what transforms now
like<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.310> when<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.730> was<00:04:05.820> in<00:04:05.970> Europe<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.390> shot<00:04:06.600> a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
like I when I was in Europe I shot a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.880 
like I when I was in Europe I shot a
bunch<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.900> pictures<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.260> doorways<00:04:07.560> because

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
bunch of pictures of doorways because

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.229 
bunch of pictures of doorways because
they<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.250> cool<00:04:08.489> doorways<00:04:08.790> events

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
they have like cool doorways events

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.120 
they have like cool doorways events
earlier<00:04:09.269> works<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> would<00:04:10.920> at

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
earlier works but you know I would at

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.199 
earlier works but you know I would at
least<00:04:11.160> be<00:04:11.459> shooting<00:04:11.730> them<00:04:11.820> on<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:11.970> fly<00:04:12.180> so

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
least be shooting them on the fly so

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.090 
least be shooting them on the fly so
they'd<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.750> kind<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.110> skewed<00:04:13.410> one<00:04:13.440> way<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.010> it

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
they'd be kind of skewed one way and it

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.890 
they'd be kind of skewed one way and it
wouldn't<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.790> perfectly<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.450> 90

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
wouldn't be perfectly you know 90

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.569 
wouldn't be perfectly you know 90
degrees<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.380> door<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:17.130> can<00:04:17.250> actually<00:04:17.370> go

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
degrees to the door you can actually go

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.860 
degrees to the door you can actually go
in<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:17.790> start<00:04:17.850> moving<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.329> around<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.780> make

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
in and start moving that around and make

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.479 
in and start moving that around and make
it<00:04:18.959> look<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.380> perpendicular<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.430> you

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it look like it's perpendicular so you

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.409 
it look like it's perpendicular so you
basically<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:21.000> don't<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.329> be

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419

door and I try you're gonna get
distortion<00:04:30.130> when<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.310> try<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.699> much

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
distortion when you try to do that much

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.010 
distortion when you try to do that much
correction<00:04:31.270> but<00:04:31.389> you<00:04:31.509> need<00:04:31.690> like<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> few

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
correction but you need like a few

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.060 
correction but you need like a few
degrees<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.380> Correction<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.710> looks<00:04:32.889> pretty

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
degrees of Correction and looks pretty

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.680 
degrees of Correction and looks pretty
real<00:04:33.220> that's<00:04:33.580> pretty<00:04:33.789> amazing<00:04:34.030> actually<00:04:34.360> when

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
real that's pretty amazing actually when

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.749 
real that's pretty amazing actually when
you<00:04:34.750> kids<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.110> don't<00:04:35.560> expect<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.220> know<00:04:36.340> okay

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
you kids you don't expect you know okay

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.010 
you kids you don't expect you know okay
they're<00:04:36.940> going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> shift<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.389> pixels<00:04:37.750> but<00:04:37.870> it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
they're going to shift the pixels but it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.200 
they're going to shift the pixels but it
actually<00:04:38.169> looks<00:04:38.740> fantastic<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.850> looks<00:04:40.000> really

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
actually looks fantastic it looks really

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.790 
actually looks fantastic it looks really
good<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.600> shifting<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.020> shadows<00:04:41.530> or

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
good is it shifting the shadows or

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.230 
good is it shifting the shadows or
what's<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.070> actually<00:04:42.160> do<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.639> does<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.789> lot<00:04:43.060> that

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
what's it actually do it does a lot that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.550 
what's it actually do it does a lot that
does<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.419> lot<00:04:43.479> of<00:04:43.600> stuff<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.960> mean<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:44.289> not<00:04:44.380> just

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
does a lot of stuff I mean it's not just

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.600 
does a lot of stuff I mean it's not just
doing<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:44.830> thing<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.130> not<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.430> moving

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
doing one thing it's not just moving

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.520 
doing one thing it's not just moving
thing<00:04:45.789> around<00:04:46.000> it's<00:04:46.509> changing<00:04:47.050> all<00:04:47.169> it's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
thing around it's changing all it's

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.840 
thing around it's changing all it's
basically<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> messing<00:04:48.520> around<00:04:48.610> with<00:04:48.789> the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
basically the messing around with the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.159 
basically the messing around with the
whole<00:04:48.940> perspective<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.539> image<00:04:49.810> that's

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
whole perspective of the image that's

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.689 
whole perspective of the image that's
pretty<00:04:50.350> crazy<00:04:50.620> now<00:04:50.889> you<00:04:50.949> mentioned<00:04:51.340> there<00:04:51.669> are

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
pretty crazy now you mentioned there are

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.890 
pretty crazy now you mentioned there are
two<00:04:51.850> big<00:04:52.000> changes<00:04:52.509> that<00:04:52.660> made<00:04:52.780> it

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
two big changes that made it

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.850 
two big changes that made it
particularly<00:04:53.169> lightroom<00:04:53.710> three

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
particularly lightroom three

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.860 
particularly lightroom three
particularly<00:04:54.220> interesting<00:04:54.729> one<00:04:55.300> was<00:04:55.570> the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
particularly interesting one was the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.420 
particularly interesting one was the
fact<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.410> noise<00:04:56.680> reduction<00:04:56.979> actually

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
fact that the noise reduction actually

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.580 
fact that the noise reduction actually
works<00:04:57.729> was<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.479> was<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.410> lens

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
works was the was the the lens

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.960 
works was the was the the lens
correction<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.340> other<00:05:00.460> one<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.820> lens

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
correction the other one the lens

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.300 
correction the other one the lens
correction<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.449> one<00:05:01.660> of<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.840> other<00:05:01.870> ones<00:05:02.310> it's

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
correction is one of the other ones it's

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.560 
correction is one of the other ones it's
one<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.639> those<00:05:03.729> I<00:05:03.910> didn't<00:05:04.090> play<00:05:04.180> with<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.360> lot

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
one of those I didn't play with a lot

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.999 
one of those I didn't play with a lot
actually<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:04.960> have<00:05:05.199> them<00:05:05.289> with<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.620> most<00:05:05.800> fun

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
actually and have them with the most fun

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.830 
actually and have them with the most fun
with<00:05:06.220> anything<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.150> times<00:05:07.300> there<00:05:07.479> in<00:05:07.570> terms<00:05:07.690> of

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
with anything of times there in terms of

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.659 
with anything of times there in terms of
like<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.919> does<00:05:09.039> in<00:05:09.160> terms<00:05:09.190> of<00:05:09.460> managing

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
like that it does in terms of managing

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.070 
like that it does in terms of managing
your<00:05:09.910> library<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.419> makes<00:05:10.599> it<00:05:10.690> easier<00:05:10.810> can

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
your library that makes it easier can

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.409 
your library that makes it easier can
you<00:05:11.139> like<00:05:11.289> batch<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:12.400> know<00:05:12.550> editor's<00:05:13.150> yeah

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
you like batch you know editor's yeah

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.029 
you like batch you know editor's yeah
you<00:05:13.479> can<00:05:13.720> scum<00:05:14.020> it's<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.620> little<00:05:14.830> better

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
you can scum it's it's a little better

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.089 
you can scum it's it's a little better
at<00:05:15.190> doing<00:05:15.310> things<00:05:15.610> like<00:05:16.289> batch<00:05:17.289> copying<00:05:17.949> and

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
at doing things like batch copying and

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.890 
at doing things like batch copying and
batch<00:05:18.250> renaming<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:18.789> stuff<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.150> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
batch renaming and stuff like that the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.810 
batch renaming and stuff like that the
other<00:05:20.440> addition<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:20.889> I<00:05:20.949> like<00:05:21.190> is<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.490> lot<00:05:21.729> of

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
other addition that I like is a lot of

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.520 
other addition that I like is a lot of
the<00:05:21.910> output<00:05:22.270> stuff<00:05:22.539> has<00:05:22.750> been<00:05:22.870> approved<00:05:23.349> for

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
the output stuff has been approved for

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.990 
the output stuff has been approved for
there's<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.770> lot<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:23.949> new<00:05:24.340> templates<00:05:24.820> for

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
there's a lot of new templates for

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.550 
there's a lot of new templates for
printing<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:25.990> can<00:05:26.080> do<00:05:26.139> all<00:05:26.169> kinds<00:05:26.259> really

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
printing so you can do all kinds really

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.409 
printing so you can do all kinds really
wacky<00:05:26.889> collages<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:27.639> stuff<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.030> that<00:05:28.090> or

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
wacky collages and stuff like that or

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.719 
wacky collages and stuff like that or
just<00:05:28.449> if<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.139> want<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.470> do<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:30.160> lot<00:05:30.669> of

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
just if you just want to do a lot of

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.980 
just if you just want to do a lot of
thumbnails<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.300> things<00:05:31.510> like<00:05:31.599> that<00:05:31.659> to<00:05:31.780> look

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
thumbnails and things like that to look

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.659 
thumbnails and things like that to look
at<00:05:32.110> pictures<00:05:32.229> on<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:33.099> printer<00:05:33.340> what<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.580> would

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
at pictures on a printer what it would

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:34.890 
at pictures on a printer what it would
look<00:05:33.789> like<00:05:33.880> on<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.090> printer<00:05:34.389> then<00:05:34.630> you<00:05:34.720> can<00:05:34.840> do

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
look like on a printer then you can do

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.420 
look like on a printer then you can do
that<00:05:35.020> too<00:05:35.229> what's<00:05:35.680> Lightroom<00:05:36.070> but<00:05:36.220> in<00:05:36.340> these

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
that too what's Lightroom but in these

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.820 
that too what's Lightroom but in these
days<00:05:36.490> I<00:05:36.880> think<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.449> retails<00:05:37.750> $300<00:05:38.590> we<00:05:38.710> can

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
days I think the retails $300 we can

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.920 
days I think the retails $300 we can
find<00:05:38.979> a<00:05:39.039> lot<00:05:39.130> cheaper<00:05:39.490> than<00:05:39.520> online<00:05:39.840> would<00:05:40.840> you

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
find a lot cheaper than online would you

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.300 
find a lot cheaper than online would you
consider<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.560> they're<00:05:41.680> like<00:05:41.800> I'm<00:05:42.099> laughing

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
consider and they're like I'm laughing

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.800 
consider and they're like I'm laughing
that<00:05:42.610> because<00:05:42.760> it's<00:05:42.880> pretty<00:05:43.210> funny<00:05:43.389> I'm<00:05:43.599> just

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
that because it's pretty funny I'm just

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.659 
that because it's pretty funny I'm just
like<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.710> know<00:05:44.740> just<00:05:45.280> when<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.520> thought

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
like you know just when you thought

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:46.950 
like you know just when you thought
you'd<00:05:45.849> be<00:05:45.970> able<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.210> get<00:05:46.300> an<00:05:46.360> amazing<00:05:46.539> camera

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
you'd be able to get an amazing camera

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.399 
you'd be able to get an amazing camera
for<00:05:47.199> under<00:05:47.349> 300<00:05:47.830> years<00:05:48.070> now<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.870> people<00:05:50.260> who

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
for under 300 years now the people who

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.200 
for under 300 years now the people who
have<00:05:50.680> photoshop<00:05:51.159> on<00:05:51.580> showing<00:05:51.760> it<00:05:51.909> lightroom

two<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:53.139> short<00:05:53.409> answer<00:05:53.740> is<00:05:53.770> only<00:05:54.220> if<00:05:54.520> you

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
two and the short answer is only if you

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.249 
two and the short answer is only if you
need<00:05:54.820> some<00:05:55.030> of<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.180> special<00:05:55.389> workflow<00:05:55.930> stuff

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
need some of the special workflow stuff

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.080 
need some of the special workflow stuff
and<00:05:56.470> library<00:05:56.800> management<00:05:57.099> because<00:05:57.789> a<00:05:57.820> lot<00:05:58.060> of

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
and library management because a lot of

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.820 
and library management because a lot of
what's<00:05:58.389> in<00:05:58.570> what's<00:05:58.750> called<00:05:58.990> camera<00:05:59.440> raw<00:05:59.620> and

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
what's in what's called camera raw and

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.339 
what's in what's called camera raw and
photoshop<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.550> what<00:06:01.150> lightroom<00:06:01.509> does<00:06:01.750> really

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
photoshop is what lightroom does really

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.439 
photoshop is what lightroom does really
just<00:06:02.800> more<00:06:03.220> sophisticated<00:06:03.849> in<00:06:04.060> front<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.330> user

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 
just more sophisticated in front of user

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.149 
just more sophisticated in front of user
interface<00:06:04.750> as<00:06:05.139> interesting<00:06:05.560> thought<00:06:05.710> in

interface as interesting thought in

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.439 
interface as interesting thought in
terms<00:06:06.310> of<00:06:06.460> workflow<00:06:06.820> management<00:06:07.120> is<00:06:07.300> that

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
terms of workflow management is that

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.820 
terms of workflow management is that
something<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.780> find<00:06:07.990> yourself<00:06:08.320> using<00:06:08.380> or<00:06:08.800> is

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
something you find yourself using or is

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.350 
something you find yourself using or is

would<00:06:16.930> use<00:06:17.020> something<00:06:17.259> called<00:06:17.349> bridge<00:06:17.620> which

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
would use something called bridge which

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.499 
would use something called bridge which
was<00:06:18.009> an<00:06:18.099> austin<00:06:18.370> adobe<00:06:18.669> app<00:06:18.789> but<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.389> is<00:06:19.479> a

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
was an austin adobe app but this is a

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:20.909 
was an austin adobe app but this is a
lot<00:06:19.690> more<00:06:19.720> flexible<00:06:20.320> and<00:06:20.380> sophisticated<00:06:20.800> in

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
lot more flexible and sophisticated in

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.080 
lot more flexible and sophisticated in
the<00:06:20.979> bridge<00:06:21.130> for<00:06:21.310> that<00:06:21.400> kind<00:06:21.550> of<00:06:21.580> stuff<00:06:21.789> what

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
the bridge for that kind of stuff what

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.360 
the bridge for that kind of stuff what
kind<00:06:22.270> of<00:06:22.300> stuff<00:06:22.479> you<00:06:22.539> do<00:06:22.780> supposedly<00:06:23.440> in<00:06:24.220> terms

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
kind of stuff you do supposedly in terms

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.129 
kind of stuff you do supposedly in terms
of<00:06:24.520> photo<00:06:24.880> management<00:06:25.180> oh<00:06:25.539> it's<00:06:25.840> just<00:06:25.990> the

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
of photo management oh it's just the

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.659 
of photo management oh it's just the
sort<00:06:26.320> of<00:06:26.409> managing<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.770> library<00:06:27.070> stuff<00:06:27.340> okay

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
sort of managing the library stuff okay

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.670 
sort of managing the library stuff okay
so<00:06:27.729> it's<00:06:28.120> the<00:06:28.659> fact<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.110> it<00:06:29.259> automatically

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
so it's the fact that it automatically

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.350 
so it's the fact that it automatically
date<00:06:29.889> sorts<00:06:30.220> and<00:06:30.400> stuff<00:06:30.550> like<00:06:30.639> that<00:06:30.729> and<00:06:30.880> we

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
date sorts and stuff like that and we

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.180 
date sorts and stuff like that and we
and<00:06:31.930> names<00:06:32.199> folders<00:06:32.560> for<00:06:32.710> you<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:32.949> you<00:06:33.009> have<00:06:33.039> to

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
and names folders for you so you have to

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.110 
and names folders for you so you have to
worry<00:06:33.340> about<00:06:33.430> against<00:06:33.789> that's<00:06:34.030> actually

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
worry about against that's actually

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.480 
worry about against that's actually
really<00:06:34.419> convenient

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
really convenient

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.879 
really convenient
Flickr<00:06:36.419> Picasa<00:06:36.750> would<00:06:37.319> they<00:06:37.410> be<00:06:37.470> considered

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
Flickr Picasa would they be considered

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.770 
Flickr Picasa would they be considered
sort<00:06:38.039> of<00:06:38.130> low-end<00:06:38.550> versions<00:06:38.940> of<00:06:39.090> something

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
sort of low-end versions of something

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.120 
sort of low-end versions of something
like<00:06:39.870> this<00:06:39.930> well<00:06:40.380> Picasso<00:06:40.500> of<00:06:40.830> course<00:06:41.009> is

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.550

really<00:06:49.410> about<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:49.650> manager<00:06:50.009> I<00:06:50.069> mean<00:06:50.250> is<00:06:50.370> sort<00:06:50.729> of

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
really about a manager I mean is sort of

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.040 
really about a manager I mean is sort of
but<00:06:51.000> it<00:06:51.210> picasa<00:06:51.509> is<00:06:51.690> probably<00:06:51.900> a<00:06:51.960> little

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
but it picasa is probably a little

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.839 
but it picasa is probably a little
better<00:06:52.259> because<00:06:52.500> you<00:06:52.770> have<00:06:52.919> the<00:06:53.009> integration

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 
better because you have the integration

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.450 
better because you have the integration
between<00:06:53.970> application<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:54.960> and<00:06:55.199> and<00:06:56.099> picasa
