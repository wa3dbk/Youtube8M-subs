00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
hi this is Jeff Wilkins on behalf of

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.180 
hi this is Jeff Wilkins on behalf of
expert<00:00:05.260> village<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:08.230> next<00:00:08.530> step<00:00:08.710> is<00:00:08.980> we're

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
expert village the next step is we're

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.770 
expert village the next step is we're
going<00:00:09.280> to<00:00:09.340> take<00:00:09.580> this<00:00:09.790> wing<00:00:10.090> and<00:00:10.389> stand<00:00:10.660> it

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
going to take this wing and stand it

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.629 
going to take this wing and stand it
upright<00:00:11.019> we've<00:00:11.769> got<00:00:11.889> to<00:00:11.980> create<00:00:12.160> something

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
upright we've got to create something

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.240 
upright we've got to create something
that<00:00:12.820> will<00:00:13.000> make<00:00:13.030> it<00:00:13.330> stay<00:00:13.599> in<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:13.870> position

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
that will make it stay in that position

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.530 
that will make it stay in that position
so<00:00:15.250> with<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.490> tying<00:00:15.759> thread<00:00:16.119> I'll<00:00:16.330> pull<00:00:16.509> the

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
so with the tying thread I'll pull the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.050 
so with the tying thread I'll pull the
wing<00:00:16.810> back<00:00:17.050> I'll<00:00:17.890> start<00:00:18.220> wrapping<00:00:18.669> the<00:00:18.849> thread

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
wing back I'll start wrapping the thread

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.120 
wing back I'll start wrapping the thread
right<00:00:19.779> at<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.079> base<00:00:20.230> of<00:00:20.290> it<00:00:21.599> and<00:00:22.739> the<00:00:23.739> build-up

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
right at the base of it and the build-up

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.339 
right at the base of it and the build-up
of<00:00:24.279> thread<00:00:24.640> which<00:00:24.910> I<00:00:25.180> like<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.480> envision<00:00:26.079> is

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
of thread which I like to envision is

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.130 
of thread which I like to envision is
like<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.529> cone<00:00:26.860> in<00:00:27.160> front<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.700> the<00:00:27.759> wing<00:00:28.140> wing

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
like a cone in front of the wing wing

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.769 
like a cone in front of the wing wing
material<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:30.939> cause<00:00:31.149> that<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.509> stand

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
material is going to cause that to stand

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.160 
material is going to cause that to stand
upright<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:34.540> technique<00:00:34.930> will<00:00:35.140> work

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
upright and that technique will work

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.740 
upright and that technique will work
with<00:00:35.560> any<00:00:35.830> material<00:00:36.490> not<00:00:36.670> just<00:00:36.700> this<00:00:37.180> yarn<00:00:37.510> but

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
with any material not just this yarn but

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.720 
with any material not just this yarn but
any<00:00:37.900> hair<00:00:38.260> or<00:00:38.290> other<00:00:38.860> material<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.340> might<00:00:39.490> use

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
any hair or other material you might use

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.170 
any hair or other material you might use
for<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.890> we<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.370> wing<00:00:42.550> upright<00:00:42.970> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
for that so we have the wing upright the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.930 
for that so we have the wing upright the
next<00:00:43.510> step<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:43.990> tying<00:00:44.680> any<00:00:44.890> parachute<00:00:45.520> pattern

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
next step in tying any parachute pattern

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.670 
next step in tying any parachute pattern
is<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.270> create<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.570> post<00:00:46.870> around<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.470> base<00:00:47.650> of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
is to create a post around the base of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.430 
is to create a post around the base of
the<00:00:47.950> wing<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.300> way<00:00:49.450> we<00:00:49.600> do<00:00:49.750> that<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:49.990> we<00:00:50.170> do<00:00:50.350> it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
the wing the way we do that is we do it

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.650 
the wing the way we do that is we do it
with<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.560> tying<00:00:50.860> thread<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.490> I<00:00:52.270> prefer<00:00:52.630> to

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
with a tying thread and I prefer to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.780 
with a tying thread and I prefer to
looking<00:00:53.230> down<00:00:53.380> on<00:00:53.530> top<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.040> I'm<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
looking down on top of it I'm a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.580 
looking down on top of it I'm a
right-handed<00:00:55.420> tire<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:56.050> we're<00:00:56.230> going<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.410> go

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
right-handed tire so we're going to go

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.830 
right-handed tire so we're going to go
from<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.610> position<00:00:57.850> looking<00:00:58.480> straight<00:00:58.810> down

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
from that position looking straight down

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.060 
from that position looking straight down
the<00:00:59.170> flow<00:00:59.380> i'm<00:00:59.440> going<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.680> go<00:00:59.739> in<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.890> clockwise

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
the flow i'm going to go in a clockwise

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.670 
the flow i'm going to go in a clockwise
direction<00:01:00.960> i'm<00:01:01.960> going<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> take<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.410> tying

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
direction i'm going to take the tying

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.360 
direction i'm going to take the tying
thread<00:01:03.689> and<00:01:04.689> go<00:01:05.439> around<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.920> base<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.130> the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
thread and go around the base of the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.510 
thread and go around the base of the
wing<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.200> thing<00:01:08.440> that's<00:01:08.590> important<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
wing the thing that's important is the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.700 
wing the thing that's important is the
plane<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> thread<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:11.050> plane<00:01:11.350> should<00:01:11.680> be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
plane of the thread the plane should be

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.340 
plane of the thread the plane should be
this<00:01:12.330> bob<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.360> tip<00:01:13.690> pointing<00:01:13.930> down<00:01:14.200> at<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
this bob and tip pointing down at the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.380 
this bob and tip pointing down at the
table<00:01:14.560> flat<00:01:15.220> plane<00:01:15.550> that's<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:15.940> line<00:01:16.120> with<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
table flat plane that's in line with the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.140 
table flat plane that's in line with the
hook<00:01:16.510> shank<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:17.710> an<00:01:17.920> angle<00:01:18.280> which<00:01:18.549> causes<00:01:19.000> it

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
hook shank not an angle which causes it

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
hook shank not an angle which causes it
to<00:01:19.180> come<00:01:19.420> on<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.049> you<00:01:20.140> want<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> wrap<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.770> with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.940 

steady<00:01:24.790> pressure<00:01:25.180> keeping<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.290> thread<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:26.920> a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
steady pressure keeping the thread on a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
steady pressure keeping the thread on a
flat<00:01:27.340> plane<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:30.159> we're<00:01:30.310> doing<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.760> we're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
flat plane what we're doing is we're

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.770 
flat plane what we're doing is we're
creating<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.479> rigid<00:01:31.869> base<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.940> two<00:01:34.600> more

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
creating a rigid base that in two more

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.310 
creating a rigid base that in two more
steps<00:01:35.110> we're<00:01:35.500> going<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.680> wrap<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.159> hackle

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
steps we're going to wrap the hackle

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.420 
steps we're going to wrap the hackle
around<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.409> base<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.920> wing<00:01:39.130> this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
around the base of the wing this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.300 
around the base of the wing this
provides<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.970> rigid<00:01:40.330> surface<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:41.049> top<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:42.190> which

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
provides a rigid surface on top of which

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.530 
provides a rigid surface on top of which
that<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:42.970> happen<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:45.640> called<00:01:45.909> posting

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
that can happen so that's called posting

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.260 
that can happen so that's called posting
the<00:01:46.689> wing<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.670> stays<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.240> that

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
the wing now so it stays in that

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.789 
the wing now so it stays in that
position<00:01:49.570> I'm<00:01:49.990> going<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.200> take<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.500> hit

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
position I'm going to take a little hit

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.500 
position I'm going to take a little hit
cement<00:01:52.320> take<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> little<00:01:53.680> drop<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:55.270> can

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
cement take a little drop of it this can

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.000 
cement take a little drop of it this can
be<00:01:55.540> drying<00:01:55.960> while<00:01:56.200> we're<00:01:56.350> finishing<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.830> rest

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
be drying while we're finishing the rest

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.719 
be drying while we're finishing the rest
of<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.220> fly<00:01:58.080> put<00:01:59.080> just<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.439> DAB<00:01:59.650> front<00:02:00.130> back<00:02:00.430> and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
of the fly put just a DAB front back and
