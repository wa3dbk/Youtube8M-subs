00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.689
 Well, that 's the theme, what I think today 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.069
 football federation or the league to what 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.799
 they are bound I think they see us more 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.630
 now that before 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.929
 in the Netherlands also to answer 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.770
 sorry and most of the means that I have 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.480
 could hear about all radio 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.390
 from the point of view they do not even read 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.240
 topic 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.420
 because they do not get to be talking about 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.420
 the green uniforms louisillo rafa but 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.790
 and if he gave permission or did not give permission and if 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.490
 there is a fine for teams how much 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.200
 it's the fine to see that's the rafa topic is 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.760
 having so simple, that is not the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.560
 subject is discarded because there is a 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:53.660
 commissioner a representative of the league 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:58.030
 mx that is the whole subject of called me 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.030
 you said that topic did not matter 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.440
 yesterday the whole reason with the subject and what 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.190
 only I said something that you also 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.940
 concludes 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.020
 is that it was a great marketing idea 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.880
 of the signature nike and that without a doubt then 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.130
 clearly agadez and I can think what 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.050
 same but we landed something common in a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
 subject and there is the recording and we said 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.690
 clearly I said the regulation by 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.120
 subject is the regulation do it more talk 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.990
 with god the league is worth if you have a 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.990
 answer that to give it has to give no 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 never 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:47.660
 they grab to blows they grab to kicks 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:55.430
 It is important that you speak to explain 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:58.370
 what theme and now yes my nights 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.510
 buying it myself on the radio because it 's a 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.220
 radio to rally by can they put 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.740
 we are so modern as to put you 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.510
 play to yesterday's thing and say here is 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.570
 what we talked about in meat tapes 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.270
 let come what will carry your theme is 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.820
 exposed and I said what 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.970
 where there is an agreement is that the part 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.040
 regulation was violated and ask 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.750
 quite humility what some of 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 you said chirinos sure that is the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.880
 only one that points important things already 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:35.490
 that the table in front on Sundays 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.490
 it's important and I favor sales 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.880
 yes to other teams that requested 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.790
 permission to use uniforms me 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.190
 I remember the theme of chuy crown of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.370
 Navy Blue flour and said 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.530
 that not a reason they told him not like 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.240
 it may now be possible to write this 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:10.270
 yesterday morning cast crown was an evil 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:13.540
 write and they told him not to be the 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.020
 put before and only lamented that I do 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.210
 articles the same directors plates or 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.330
 high whatever senior managers 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.480
 allow four teams to change their 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.110
 uniform I insist that is not nike and nike and 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 brilliant bright nike and adidas already 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.540
 will know that answering the issue is how to 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.550
 where since the league allowed 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 that if there is a fine I insist the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.210
 obligation is to say we fine the 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.120
 equipment with so much purpose but that the pay 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.010
 the sponsor does cut but then 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.110
 you'll have seen driving the regulations 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.790
 I believe that but it has to be something 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.100
 much more serious if you break the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.530
 regulation or do not follow the regulation to 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.420
 I have to punish you 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.590
 the way that is endorsed by the league 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.810
 very strong 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.730
 the three point point from right now is 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.730
 taking a graph of the advantage
