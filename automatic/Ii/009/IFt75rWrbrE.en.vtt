00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.929
 click click is the name of the new one 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.929
 collection I created for daniel 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 because it's called click 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.680
 I really like the name 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.300
 different components and various ideas that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 they came to my mind as far as 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 fashion concerns furnishing 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.289
 the design is a different click you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 components taken from different parts 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 of the world in a very free and non-free way 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.309
 granted that I really think it is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 beautiful click and endless femininity 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.350
 represents purity and simplicity 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.710
 of youth not contaminated by the world 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.710
 of adults 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.350
 in terms of hair style and design er 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.150
 in general many hairdressers are 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.489
 always been brave in proposing one 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.070
 avant-garde style and a look 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.470
 really amazing with hair and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.150
 this is what i also love doing but 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 at the same time I felt the need to 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.340
 go in the opposite direction because 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.110
 because I think probably in the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.369
 last twenty years we really went 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.920
 too far 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.380
 in many fields but by design beauty 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:32.320
 everything and we have never enjoyed the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.149
 simplicity of some of the elements for 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.420
 this is why we have made some 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.700
 very simple very basic cuts but with 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 something that expresses a hint to 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.600
 past of this sector 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 precisely these small elements e 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 beautiful make this collection 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 splendid and surprising 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.690
 the color is truly unique because it reflects 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.300
 the spirit of the collection 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.030
 I think Edward Paludo did one 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.770
 wonderful work we used the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.340
 flan bojan in a completely new way 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.960
 different and with a surprising result 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.920
 helping to create this feeling of 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:21.050
 innocence in the proposed looks the hair 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.460
 they look very natural thanks to 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.170
 application of the products in a manner 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.790
 uniform and delicate 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 as for the fold there are 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 things you can do on your own and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.820
 others for which it is necessary 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.000
 the intervention of a professional e 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.890
 I think this is another merit 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.610
 interaction between professionals and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.880
 customers I think this collection 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.460
 represent well from the nas because we 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.000
 we are innovation creativity but in a way 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.710
 very delicate and we love beautiful things but 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 that they have a balance they are 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.020
 very feminine and beautiful at the time 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 same 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.110
 all these elements have clicks for me
