00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
like that but it was a little bit

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.430 
like that but it was a little bit
disappointed<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.300> diets<00:02:25.690> don't<00:02:25.780> work<00:02:26.019> on<00:02:26.319> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
jumps and bumps and stuff like that will

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.420 
jumps and bumps and stuff like that will
handle<00:03:15.700> pretty<00:03:16.000> well<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.959> has<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.620> like

handle pretty well and it has the like

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.330 
handle pretty well and it has the like
the<00:03:21.609> off-road<00:03:22.060> body<00:03:22.359> with<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.190> supports<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
stuff like that the strengthen the body

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.750 
stuff like that the strengthen the body
because<00:03:26.889> most<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.370> these<00:03:27.549> little<00:03:28.359> plastic<00:03:29.760> car

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
because most of these little plastic car

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.479 
because most of these little plastic car
shells<00:03:31.150> they're<00:03:31.750> pretty<00:03:32.680> weak<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.400> they

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
shells they're pretty weak and they

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.030 
shells they're pretty weak and they

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
could break if the cars are big enough

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.140 
could break if the cars are big enough
crash<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.790> big<00:03:37.209> enough<00:03:37.920> hit<00:03:38.920> two<00:03:39.220> or<00:03:39.609> roll<00:03:39.850> or

anything<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.630> what<00:03:41.019> you're<00:03:41.170> doing<00:03:41.440> but

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
anything like that what you're doing but

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.300 
anything like that what you're doing but
this<00:03:41.799> happens<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.910> pretty<00:03:43.480> strong<00:03:44.310> Doug

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
this happens to be pretty strong Doug

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.729 
this happens to be pretty strong Doug
you<00:03:46.299> don't<00:03:46.510> really<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.900> any<00:03:47.109> marking<00:03:47.530> when

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
you don't really see any marking when

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.620 
you don't really see any marking when
you<00:03:47.859> crash<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.400> roller<00:03:48.639> anything<00:03:49.299> like<00:03:49.450> this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
you crash the roller anything like this

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.710 
you crash the roller anything like this
but<00:03:49.900> either<00:03:50.620> they've<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.579> done<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.880> traxxas

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
but either they've just done a traxxas

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.509 
but either they've just done a traxxas
is<00:03:52.840> done<00:03:53.019> an<00:03:53.139> overall<00:03:53.560> good<00:03:53.829> job<00:03:53.889> with<00:03:54.340> the

on<00:03:57.370> everything<00:03:57.670> like<00:03:57.819> that<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:59.470> take<00:03:59.769> it<00:03:59.920> off

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
on everything like that just take it off

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:08.370 
on everything like that just take it off
and<00:04:02.730> underneath<00:04:03.730> with<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:06.239> summit<00:04:07.239> VXL<00:04:07.599> comes

engine and system like that it is a what
fast<00:04:17.320> they'll<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.889> it<00:04:18.099> probably<00:04:18.639> about<00:04:20.130> 25

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
fast they'll do it probably about 25

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.730 
fast they'll do it probably about 25
miles<00:04:21.579> per<00:04:21.760> hour<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> standard<00:04:22.780> battery

that<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.950> get<00:04:24.130> with<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.370> normally<00:04:25.000> but<00:04:25.599> with

that you get with it normally but with

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.590 
that you get with it normally but with
a<00:04:26.470> double<00:04:26.920> battery<00:04:27.370> will<00:04:27.700> two<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.480> these

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
a double battery will two of these

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.570 
a double battery will two of these
little<00:04:28.780> batteries<00:04:29.320> it'll<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.800> about<00:04:30.040> 40<00:04:30.400> miles

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
little batteries it'll do about 40 miles

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.270 
little batteries it'll do about 40 miles
per<00:04:30.730> hour<00:04:31.000> which<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.390> not<00:04:32.020> bad<00:04:32.050> because<00:04:32.620> if<00:04:33.070> you

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
per hour which is not bad because if you

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.370 
per hour which is not bad because if you
