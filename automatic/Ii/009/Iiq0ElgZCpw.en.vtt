00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
been there all the same basic idea if

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670

you're<00:01:35.820> punching<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.990> I'll<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.560> off

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.810 
you're punching I think I'll get off
straight<00:01:37.950> onto<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> fist<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.579> can't<00:01:38.790> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
straight onto the fist here can't be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.179 
straight onto the fist here can't be
like<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.030> baby<00:01:39.299> love<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.200> thing<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
like that baby love that thing like that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.190 
like that baby love that thing like that
I'll<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.579> straight<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> fist<00:01:42.210> didn't<00:01:42.780> Jan

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
I'll get straight to the fist didn't Jan

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
I'll get straight to the fist didn't Jan
same<00:01:43.799> basic<00:01:44.280> principle<00:01:44.579> okay<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
same basic principle okay think of that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
same basic principle okay think of that
so<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.140> basic<00:01:46.590> idea<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so all this is very basic idea of it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
so all this is very basic idea of it
what<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.509> used<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.649> them
