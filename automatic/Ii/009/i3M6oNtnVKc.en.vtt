health<00:02:58.709> bar<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.100> help<00:02:59.310> or<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.850> pop<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
health bar as help or can pop up and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.690 
health bar as help or can pop up and
that<00:03:01.200> works<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.620> any<00:03:01.770> other<00:03:02.100> outside

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that works for any other outside

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
that works for any other outside
glitches<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.360> may<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.260> reason

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
glitches that you may do and the reason

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.080 
glitches that you may do and the reason
why<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> say<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.190> while<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.880> are

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
why I say that is because while you are

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.580 
why I say that is because while you are
glitched<00:03:06.450> outside<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.959> map<00:03:07.110> you're<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.440> able

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
glitched outside the map you're not able

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.280 
glitched outside the map you're not able
to<00:03:07.800> see<00:03:08.070> enemies<00:03:08.430> health<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
to see enemies health but the way that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
to see enemies health but the way that
you<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.890> enemies<00:03:11.100> health<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
you can see enemies health is if you

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.750 
you can see enemies health is if you
point<00:03:12.989> out<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.380> once<00:03:13.560> again<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.100> don't<00:03:14.489> know<00:03:14.580> why

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
point out on once again I don't know why

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760 
point out on once again I don't know why
but<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.120> makes<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.450> health<00:03:15.630> bar<00:03:15.840> pop<00:03:16.140> up<00:03:16.410> so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
but it makes the health bar pop up so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.140 
but it makes the health bar pop up so
that<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.100> help<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.489> seeing<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> progress

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that can help with seeing the progress

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.030 
that can help with seeing the progress
that<00:03:18.420> you've<00:03:18.600> done<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.260> enemy<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.860> pretty

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
that you've done on the enemy but pretty

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.620 
that you've done on the enemy but pretty
much<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.730> take<00:03:20.970> your<00:03:21.090> time<00:03:21.150> back

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
much you can just take your time back
