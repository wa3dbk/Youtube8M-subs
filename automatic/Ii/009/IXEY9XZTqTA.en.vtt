before the musket just would sometimes

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
before the musket just would sometimes
shoot<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> tornado<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
shoot out a tornado it was like a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
shoot out a tornado it was like a
one-third<00:00:59.160> chance<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.640> happening

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
one-third chance of it happening

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.630 
one-third chance of it happening
it<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.570> enemies<00:01:01.309> drop<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.520> their

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
via the tornado that's awesome by

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690

throwing<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> hope<00:01:14.040> system<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
throwing them on to the hope system the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
throwing them on to the hope system the
ethics<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.420> squeeze<00:01:15.900> eggs<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:18.259> um

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
ethics that squeeze eggs like that um

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the other gun we've got is the e/m wave

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070 
the other gun we've got is the e/m wave
gun<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> co-op<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.450> weapon<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
gun this is a co-op only weapon like I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
gun this is a co-op only weapon like I
had<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.439> laser<00:01:25.710> doesn't<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.580> anything<00:01:26.909> by

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
had this laser doesn't do anything by

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.370 
had this laser doesn't do anything by
itself<00:01:27.210> even<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> shoot<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.140> both

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
itself even if I shoot it but if we both

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
itself even if I shoot it but if we both
cross<00:01:31.880> actually<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.119> should<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.420> point<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
cross actually we should like point it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100 
cross actually we should like point it
at<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> tank<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.290> something<00:01:34.470> okay<00:01:35.810> both<00:01:36.810> point

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
at the tank or something okay both point

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.060 
at the tank or something okay both point
at<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.409> fire

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.740 

electromagnetic<00:01:42.070> wave<00:01:42.460> God<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:43.509> make<00:01:43.720> a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
electromagnetic wave God so you make a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.270 
electromagnetic wave God so you make a
big<00:01:43.990> explosion<00:01:44.259> when<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.710> cross<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.009> streams

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
big explosion when you cross the streams

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.420 
big explosion when you cross the streams
like<00:01:45.490> you're<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:45.820> Ghostbusters<00:01:46.600> or<00:01:46.750> something

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
like you're in Ghostbusters or something

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.980 
like you're in Ghostbusters or something
so<00:01:48.430> it'll<00:01:48.790> never<00:01:48.909> do<00:01:49.119> anything<00:01:49.360> if<00:01:49.659> it's<00:01:49.810> just

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
so it'll never do anything if it's just

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.410 
so it'll never do anything if it's just
one<00:01:50.290> person<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.759> gotta<00:01:51.970> have<00:01:52.210> two

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
one person right you gotta have two

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:03.649 
one person right you gotta have two
people<00:01:52.690> with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.110> gun<00:01:53.320> for<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.740> do<00:01:53.890> anything

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.969 

this<00:02:04.659> one<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.170> gonna<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.560> little<00:02:05.740> hard<00:02:05.890> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
your key um I don't know how far that

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.470 
your key um I don't know how far that
laser<00:02:23.410> goes<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.489> cover<00:02:24.730> me<00:02:24.910> from<00:02:25.209> way<00:02:25.450> over

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
laser goes I can cover me from way over

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.710 
laser goes I can cover me from way over
there<00:02:26.250> okay<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.760> am<00:02:28.060> wavenet<00:02:28.450> I'm
