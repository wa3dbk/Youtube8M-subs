00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.740
 Please put the same amount of flavor here. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.900

 Usually when it comes time Matsunaga other rooms Blindfolded meat mogo cycle grab some japnae 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:30.279
 You use a lot of tastes for it. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.179
 But I'm not only using this magic today to catch such a shot, 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.150
 on 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:41.400
 It's a sweet taste. In the case of the same taste , 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.430
 So now it comes out with a lot of sugar and these things. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:50.200
 I also have a natural sweetness in it. 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.870
 So instead of sugar or fruit or vegetables and sweetness that is missing from this stuff 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 Because I'm very fit. 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 Please mix them one by one. 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 Only I got the chopped onion and put it here for now 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.780
 I'll put sesame oil in here. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.979
 Well, these spices do not mix well together. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.979
 Let's take a look at the liver 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.930
 Look Twice more 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.450
 I'll add some lips of meat. 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.400
 I'll make that broth quick. 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.420
 Before us 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.850
 The fruit-cutting things that we had 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 I'll put it in the pot. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.600
 Pour water enough to lock it all over here. 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.930
 After the adrenal gland , I put in a little soy sauce to make a very light flavored soy sauce. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.930
 You can boil it. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.990
 Now so by raising saga in one 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.990
 Boil it. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 Ah 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 Now when you put it on the fire, the boy will just boggle up. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.290
 Then you can boil it for about two-thirds 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.290
 I want to make broth. 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:53.510
 Now we're going to make a ponzu sauce for a delicious roasted meat. 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.830
 Sariwon Korean BBQ I've went, we ate there, the book is really a source Hongro 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.690
 It was delicious. 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.200
 So I thought that there was a way I could do it easily . 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.630
 I sold the lemon soy sauce just like this . 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.030
 Upon a very easy source is usually put on a peach vinegar soy Day 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.740
 You're making a dipping sauce. 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.600
 Already here 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.610
 I've heard of soy sauce nemong. So you do not have to squeeze and you can use it too easily. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.060
 I bought it because it seemed to be. 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 First, 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.140
 Please put as much as you want to eat . 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.120
 Oh, if you do it again, you might not look good. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.840
 Yeogida able to slightly square deohaejul four hyangman I put lemon zest 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.270
 Will 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.920
 The term jest usually means a little like lemon or lime or orange 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:52.690
 I'm telling you to change the citrus fruit and grind it. 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.910
 If you grind this shell, you will not give it any more tastes . 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.230
 I 'll put more incense in it, so let's peel a little lemon peel. 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:05.260
 Grind 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:09.220
 Parties should put in the sauce so to put lemon peel 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 I did a homemade tortoise to eat . 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.830
 So I made it up to ponzu soft, and I 'm boiling in the middle of it. 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.830
 Now, 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:25.890
 I think it is very delicious and well boiled. 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.890
 I'll be devoted. 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.490
 Now you just have to cook the meat . 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.830
 I'll put the meat first on the fire. 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:45.750
 So, you have to bring the meat as it is on the plate . 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.010
 I do not even come to make bulgogi. 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.729
 He gave it to me. 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:56.910
 This is the point at Sariwon Bulgogi. 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:05:02.220
 Because one does not raise sewooji just leave the meat more flavor of the meat 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.520
 You can make it better. And again, this song is not beige inside. 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 So you can eat it with low salt. 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.040
 Now, after you have put it like this, 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.430
 Put it on top. 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.430
 This way. 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:29.750
 Now , just sprinkle the sauce after this . 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.750
 The amount we made so delicious
