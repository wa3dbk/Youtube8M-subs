00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.680
 hello everybody, welcome more then 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.559
 This video is on the dot com bank. 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.950
 joão carlos talking to you this is a 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:33.420
 video that we will do about them 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.100
 So we'll try to explain here. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.079
 in as much detail as possible 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.530
 operation of a basic bidding process 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.900
 that we know and the propeller is made to 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 pull the aircraft and it works for a 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.930
 rule of action and reaction right 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 then this action and reaction works more 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.110
 or less how the wing of an airplane works 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.000
 Look, there's a touch of a toucan. This is the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.820
 wing profile of wing profile 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.399
 here we have the dynamic rope and the veto 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.659
 relative here that generates a temptation that 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.180
 event relative to the rope is a form 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.009
 angle of attack né of the rope with wind 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.710
 reason is that there is a year of attack and 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.320
 seal generates a support here 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.360
 profile that in this case is the profile of the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.360
 I'm still talking about wing because the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.220
 people will make an association of 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 functioning of the wing with the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.670
 of the propeller which is very similar 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.229
 So, here, as we go. 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 increasing the angle of attack to 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.909
 support increases and trawling also 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.880
 there comes a point that support caetano 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.280
 stoll and the drag increases a lot then 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.760
 would be the stall point of the profile of a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.110
 which can also be used to 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.110
 make an association with the propellers 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.390
 so here we see that lc is nothing 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.400
 no less than an airfoil 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.460
 rotary wing is nothing other than a rotating wing 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.580
 it turns this way that you are 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.520
 Seeing there generating is the support for 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.420
 pulled so let's observe what 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 happens to the propeller paw for her not 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.470
 be exactly the same as the differences for 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.250
 a wing right 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.849
 so we have here in this part 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.040
 we have the rope profile line of 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.650
 the root of the helix on the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.500
 the search for the propeller and here we have 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.810
 then this line of rope and here would be 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.360
 ll see rotation plane will generate 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.240
 down in this plane of rotation 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 here forming this angle with the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.860
 her rope here this year is formed by the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.250
 agreement between the plane of rotation of 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.250
 propeller 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.209
 then you work step to them that the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.880
 people will go into detail about the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.330
 I work at his place if this is 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.490
 the pitch angle of him that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.860
 section of the propeller in that part of the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.350
 is that they are against him if he turns the tip 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.080
 rotating propeller just a speed 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.090
 higher than the root of the elite that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.450
 lse cube to care for and demanded 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.489
 slowly and erroneously points to them and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 this reason it is necessary to 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:15.070
 what you are seeing here 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.709
 following the rotation of the lc will generate here 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.510
 a certain angle of attack with the plane of 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.440
 rotation and here is the angle of attack 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.870
 smaller 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.620
 if that tip of it if it has the same 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.140
 angle of attack than the root of the fact 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.450
 will require faster than the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.739
 propeller root will generate 1 am in the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.870
 propeller tip 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.769
 all right then so the he has a 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.010
 tors is less at its tip than at the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.010
 root 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.460
 then it would be interesting to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.760
 starting people already discuss what the 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.160
 types of propeller that we then have with 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 relation to the making of the propeller 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.570
 first we have the propellers 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.480
 which are wooden how are you 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.160
 seeing it is a propeller made of 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.450
 wood and we also sometimes have 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.580
 made of metal that is the one you 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.590
 are you there and then have plastic 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.950
 is composed of plastic composites are 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.960
 carbon fiber and other materials 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.650
 which is used today in the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.040
 aviation there more modern, so let 's 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.140
 the next nobody we delete them 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.470
 here in white on representing a 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.070
 part of it if we have it in gray 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:50.240
 here is the spirit of the propeller and here the 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:55.220
 People have this line in red with 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.040
 relative wind because of lse 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.380
 She's spinning from top to bottom. 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.800
 and believe in this line the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.200
 rotation of the propeller and here the wind 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.860
 relative to that dashed line which well 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.950
 clarinha is the string line of this 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.010
 dynamic profile of the propeller and in that 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.940
 blue is the amount to see the other uespi 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.660
 that it will develop for the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 then right aircraft is also the angle 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.310
 we can use it as if it were a 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.220
 angle here this step to them and 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.150
 People are going to explain it very well. 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.950
 for you are 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.900
 then what happens at this angle of the 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.180
 related event formed with the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.260
 rotation of the propeller according to the aircraft 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.229
 speeding up your speed 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.419
 increasing its aerodynamic speed 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.729
 this angle begins to grow larger then 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.890
 this wind angle relative and arrives 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.770
 a point that it begins to focus on 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.740
 Propeller a way that it leaves 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.110
 she produces traction then the propeller 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.820
 need to wring her pace need 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.370
 turn them up step up or down 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.020
 slow down to continue 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.160
 creating efficiency as we go 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.110
 see through the wind 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.740
 giving then was 9 is gaining speed 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.630
 in this case there and it needs visor 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.510
 continue to receive this relative event 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.100
 in that part of here , because 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.410
 if the relative wind that comes feeling 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.350
 In this region the propeller will generate the 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.750
 attraction and the relative wind has 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.580
 to focus on this region here in order to 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.240
 generate the attraction forward in this 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.860
 support for them 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.010
 as promised some attack 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.750
 aaaah pays him if he needs to increase his 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.950
 portion you need to increase the pace 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.530
 of this propeller 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.200
 We'll see that we even find 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.950
 indicating the direction of the flight 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.360
 o LSE with a specific step 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.160
 people will realize that according to 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.100
 speed will increase 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.800
 theoretically not increasing the speed 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:03.600
 the step of it needs to change too 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.850
 in this way if you step down 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.830
 man from the palace in the propeller for her 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.800
 improve the use of it and not 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.990
 spinning relative convent beating 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.470
 here where would be the extra back of the pay 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.470
 they are not 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.820
 so here the common goal is just to increase 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.820
 and the step of it
