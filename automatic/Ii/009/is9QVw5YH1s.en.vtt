to<00:01:28.690> probably<00:01:28.840> change<00:01:29.140> cars<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:29.650> because<00:01:30.280> it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
to probably change cars here because it

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.740 
to probably change cars here because it
fills<00:01:30.580> up<00:01:30.730> my<00:01:30.760> focus<00:01:31.180> gate<00:01:31.330> talking<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.660> me

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
fills up my focus gate talking to me

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.200 
fills up my focus gate talking to me
they'll<00:01:31.870> start<00:01:32.050> boosting<00:01:32.230> when<00:01:32.710> i<00:01:32.740> change<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
they'll start boosting when i change so

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.400 
they'll start boosting when i change so
i<00:01:37.270> can<00:01:37.420> either<00:01:37.540> try<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.720> get<00:01:37.930> up<00:01:38.020> next<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.290> the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
i can either try to get up next to the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.700 
i can either try to get up next to the
side<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.980> aim<00:01:39.550> shot<00:01:39.850> out<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.530> tanks<00:01:41.530> from<00:01:41.620> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
side and aim shot out the tanks from the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.280 
side and aim shot out the tanks from the
side<00:01:41.860> or<00:01:41.890> try<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.190> get<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.430> front<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.760> cyclone

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
side or try to get in front and cyclone

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.960 
side or try to get in front and cyclone
so<00:01:44.290> i'm<00:01:44.650> going<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.070> see<00:01:45.520> if<00:01:45.550> i<00:01:45.670> can<00:01:45.790> get<00:01:45.850> in

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
motorcycle over which is going to i was

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.119 
motorcycle over which is going to i was
going<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.569> air<00:02:23.719> jack<00:02:23.959> while<00:02:24.680> super

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
going to air jack while super

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.890

susceptible<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.909> melee<00:02:26.359> from<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.629> truck

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
susceptible to the melee from the truck

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.780 
susceptible to the melee from the truck
it's<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.560> fastest<00:02:27.980> vehicle<00:02:28.099> in<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.370> game<00:02:28.579> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
it's the fastest vehicle in the game so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.039 
it's the fastest vehicle in the game so
i<00:02:28.819> could<00:02:29.030> probably<00:02:29.180> more<00:02:29.450> easily<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.959> in

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
i could probably more easily get in

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.280 
i could probably more easily get in
front<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.379> it<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:31.879> able<00:02:31.939> to<00:02:32.180> try<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> cyclone

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
front of it to be able to try to cyclone

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
