00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.490
 the characters in the stories 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.460
 high schools 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.709
 there are authors who build characters to 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.980
 from the characteristics not from a 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.300
 person in particular but two or three 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.240
 maybe they invent a new character 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.189
 of fiction that we love to read rigoberto with 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.769
 the physical appearance of ramón el 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.510
 character of Andrew and the memory of 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.790
 past lived by fernando 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.740
 when they read the novel both Andrew and 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.140
 fernando and ramón will feel 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.140
 betrayed or at least disappointed 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.840
 I'm not like that, the three of them could say 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.410
 chorus and indeed they are not 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.930
 it is or they are only partly Rigoberto is 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.090
 and it is not and they are the author has rights 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.430
 about the truth or lie of 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.739
 Rigoberto is not in the reality of 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.080
 andrés ramón and fernando but in the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.510
 literary truth achieved or not of the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.729
 novel that we write can that to the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.150
 historians are interested to know if the 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.159
 Nude maja de goya is or not the duchess 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.409
 of dawn but the painters and those who 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.290
 they look at the picture they are interested in beauty 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.520
 the colors the strokes the sensuality and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.799
 the emotion that the canvas conveys 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.430
 Whoever was the woman who 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.460
 pulsed to overwhelm 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.380
 In that sense, the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.680
 Woody Allen film of building 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.080
 a heart in which it is analyzed with humor and 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.030
 depth the passage of reality the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.430
 fantasy and subsequent conflicts 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.390
 that the creator can have a 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.940
 cause of those who feel damaged 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.200
 if about the life of men only 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.290
 they have the right to the men themselves 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.540
 codes for believers about life 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.690
 of the characters only have the right 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 the characters themselves or their author to 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.890
 the authors who believe that the characters 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 they are our own creations 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 and what authority does a character have over 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.460
 himself then most of the big ones 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.680
 writers will say there's a lot that almost 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.690
 all and that when an author tries 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.240
 force a character to do something that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.300
 it is not your own that it does not belong to you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.060
 which is a trait probably of the author 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.310
 the character reveals himself seeks to paralyze 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 and block the writer and ask him 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.989
 write something that has nothing to do with 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.300
 the one that the author persists in his endeavor 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.850
 may force the character to give up or 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.260
 certain which thing but at the price of 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.120
 kill him 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.410
 the character will no longer be true 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.019
 it will stop being real 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.480
 literarily speaking to become 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.550
 in a puppet of the author in a doll 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.710
 of rag talking by mouth of another 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.140
 the god of genesis is the best 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.080
 novelist able to build characters 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.080
 in their image and likeness but endowing them 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.180
 of complete freedom not to force them to 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.180
 do or say something against their will 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.569
 all this looks like a community of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.980
 neighbors on a certain occasion a young 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.489
 writer's apprentice asked 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 Camilo Jose Cela for the arguments 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.599
 asked for an argument to write about 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.030
 because he believed that his difficulties with 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.830
 engine was because he had no 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.830
 interesting argument about which 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.300
 get to write cloth he pointed a 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.780
 large apartment building that had 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.480
 ahead is the interesting argument or the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.769
 except that is the one that had served 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 cela to write the column 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.050
