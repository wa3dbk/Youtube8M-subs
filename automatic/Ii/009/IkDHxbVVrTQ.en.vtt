Dreamweaver<00:03:24.930> now<00:03:25.169> I've<00:03:25.260> changed<00:03:25.650> this

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
Dreamweaver now I've changed this

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.770 
Dreamweaver now I've changed this
slightly<00:03:26.340> since<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.880> last<00:03:27.030> video<00:03:27.239> tutorial

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
slightly since the last video tutorial

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.530 
slightly since the last video tutorial
as<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.019> can<00:03:28.139> see<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:29.040> I'm<00:03:29.489> gonna<00:03:29.669> make<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
as you can see here I'm gonna make it a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.940 
as you can see here I'm gonna make it a
bit<00:03:30.690> wider<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.139> can<00:03:31.230> see<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.709> clearly

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
bit wider so you can see it more clearly

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.610 
bit wider so you can see it more clearly
and<00:03:32.519> here<00:03:33.329> is<00:03:33.510> our<00:03:33.690> email<00:03:33.959> form<00:03:34.200> who<00:03:34.290> created

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.780 
say name email and message on the code
I've<00:03:37.530> changed<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:37.980> slightly<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.609> in<00:03:38.730> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790

I've changed it slightly so in the
message<00:03:39.180> text<00:03:39.780> area<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.349> now<00:03:40.500> says<00:03:40.739> name

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
message text area it now says name

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.009 
message text area it now says name
equals<00:03:41.400> comments<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.359> really<00:03:42.660> important

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
equals comments this is really important

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.229 
equals comments this is really important
that<00:03:43.139> you<00:03:43.230> add<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.590> guys<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.790> obviously<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
for the other two inputs but it's really

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.629 
for the other two inputs but it's really
important<00:03:51.419> you<00:03:51.510> change<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.519> because<00:03:53.519> it

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
important you change that because it

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.280 
important you change that because it
matches<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.329> PHP<00:03:54.930> scripts<00:03:55.230> that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
matches up with the PHP scripts that

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.949 
matches up with the PHP scripts that
we've<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:57.379> so<00:03:58.379> that<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.069> our<00:03:59.400> email<00:04:00.120> now<00:04:00.540> we

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
we've got so that is our email now we

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.599 
we've got so that is our email now we
can<00:04:01.139> below<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.560> PHP<00:04:02.069> scripts<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.489> can

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
can below the PHP scripts we can

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.849 
can below the PHP scripts we can
actually<00:04:02.879> add<00:04:03.030> content<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.169> this<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.650> what's

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
actually add content so this is what's

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.370 
actually add content so this is what's
going<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.129> appear<00:04:05.280> if<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.049> PHP<00:04:07.049> square

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
going to appear if the PHP square

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.710 
going to appear if the PHP square
goes<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.800> plan<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.280> everything<00:04:08.430> goes<00:04:08.670> okay<00:04:09.390> so

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
goes to plan and everything goes okay so

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.870 
goes to plan and everything goes okay so
basically<00:04:09.930> we're<00:04:10.230> starting<00:04:10.650> from<00:04:11.640> scratch

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
basically we're starting from scratch

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.940 
basically we're starting from scratch
because<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.360> PHP<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.870> above<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.380> HTML

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
because the PHP is above the HTML

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.400 
because the PHP is above the HTML
programming<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.730> we've<00:04:14.850> got<00:04:15.110> HTML<00:04:16.110> scripts

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
programming that we've got HTML scripts

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.190 
programming that we've got HTML scripts
so<00:04:16.620> we<00:04:16.800> just<00:04:17.220> were<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.180> entering<00:04:18.450> our<00:04:18.750> HTML

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
so we just were just entering our HTML

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.460 
so we just were just entering our HTML
scripts<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.560> body<00:04:20.780> center<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.050> centrally

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
scripts a body center we in a centrally

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.740 
scripts a body center we in a centrally
aligned<00:04:22.850> whatever<00:04:23.850> text<00:04:24.150> we<00:04:24.210> want<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.510> appear

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
aligned whatever text we want to appear

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.570 
aligned whatever text we want to appear
so<00:04:25.350> your<00:04:25.890> message<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:27.090> sent<00:04:27.510> successfully
