00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.440
 The sunset 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.880
 The sunset 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.920
 I do not know why things are this way 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.440
 Not everything else in the world is so perfect. 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040
 Look at the sun shining for everyone 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.560
 It's to show the rain that falls. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.040
 And the cold that makes the flower in spring-summer grow 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 And the perfume that comes out of them is all for you. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840
 All this is for you to see! 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.640
 That God loves all the same. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.680
 That no one is more, what only differentiates is what agent does 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.240
 It's what the agent does! 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.600
 So I'm going to sit on the grass. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.480
 Close to a green tree that calls. 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 And the invitation leaves for you to sit and admire the sunset. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 The night, the rain, the wine, the grape, the flying of the birds and everything else 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120
 Just looking for peace. 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 And there it will be better for us who live on this earth 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.280
 Without thinking of war, poetry leaves 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 And poetry comes out! 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.640
 The sunset, the tree, the birds, the sunset 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.920
 The rain, the prima-vera, the sky and the sea, the sky and the sea the sunset. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.120
 The sunset, the tree, the birds, the sunset 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.280
 The rain, the prima-vera, the sky and the sea, the sky and the sea the sunset. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.440
 I do not know why things are this way 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.960
 Not everything else in the world is so perfect. 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.520
 Look at the sun shining for everyone 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.040
 It's to show the rain that falls. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.560
 And the cold that makes the flower in spring-summer grow 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.520
 And the perfume that comes out of them is all for you. 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.280
 All this is for you to see! 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 That God loves all the same. 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 That no one is more, what only differentiates is what agent does 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.720
 It's what the agent does! 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.040
 So I'm going to sit on the grass. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 Close to a green tree that calls. 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.880
 And the invitation leaves for you to sit and admire the sunset. 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.120
 The night, the rain, the wine, the grape, the flying of the birds and everything else 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 Just looking for peace. 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.440
 And there it will be better for us who live on this earth 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.760
 Without thinking of war, poetry leaves 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 And poetry comes out! 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.240
 The sunset, the tree, the birds, the sunset 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:23.320
 The rain, the prima-vera, the sky and the sea, the sky and the sea the sunset. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.800
 The sunset, the tree, the birds, the sunset 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.920
 The rain, the prima-vera, the sky and the sea, the sky and the sea the sunset. 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 The sunset 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.840
 The sunset 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.720
 In heaven that does 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:04.080
 the sunset
