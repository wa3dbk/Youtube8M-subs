hi this is Tamra from ugly blog.com and
in<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.090> video<00:00:09.420> I'd<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.990> demonstrate

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
in this video I'd like to demonstrate

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.850 
in this video I'd like to demonstrate
how<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.070> braid<00:00:11.490> crochet<00:00:12.269> loops<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
how to braid crochet loops now I have a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.950 
how to braid crochet loops now I have a
few<00:00:14.160> patterns<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.670> Mowgli<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.480> used<00:00:15.750> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
few patterns on Mowgli that used this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.650 
few patterns on Mowgli that used this
technique<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.800> couple<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.130> different<00:00:17.460> ways

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
technique in a couple of different ways

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
technique in a couple of different ways
right<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.350> you're<00:00:19.470> looking<00:00:19.740> at<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
right here what you're looking at is a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.470 
right here what you're looking at is a
close-up<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.689> day<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.020> beach<00:00:22.439> bag<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
close-up of the day of the beach bag and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
close-up of the day of the beach bag and
in<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.779> pattern<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.439> braided<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.340> loops

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
in this pattern I have braided the loops

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
in this pattern I have braided the loops
which<00:00:26.789> basically<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.420> pulling<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.320> set<00:00:28.529> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
which basically is pulling one set of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
which basically is pulling one set of
loops<00:00:28.800> through<00:00:29.099> another<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:30.359> I've<00:00:30.630> used

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
loops through another here I've used

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
loops through another here I've used
them<00:00:31.230> vertically<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> pattern<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
them vertically going up a pattern and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.920 
them vertically going up a pattern and
these<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.020> chain<00:00:34.410> loops<00:00:35.239> more<00:00:36.239> recently<00:00:36.660> I've

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
these are chain loops more recently I've

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
these are chain loops more recently I've
made<00:00:37.260> ups-and-downs<00:00:37.710> crochet<00:00:38.700> slouchy

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
made ups-and-downs crochet slouchy

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
made ups-and-downs crochet slouchy
beanie<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.809> matching<00:00:40.469> fingerless<00:00:40.920> mitts<00:00:41.190> and

beanie and matching fingerless mitts and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.350 
beanie and matching fingerless mitts and
this<00:00:42.149> uses<00:00:42.570> tall<00:00:42.840> stitches<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.500> work<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.860> same

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
this uses tall stitches to work the same

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
this uses tall stitches to work the same

sort of pulling loop through loops to
make<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.570> braid<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.289> horizontally<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
make the braid going horizontally in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
make the braid going horizontally in
this<00:00:51.090> video<00:00:51.360> I'd<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> show<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.930> both

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
this video I'd like to show you both

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.220 
this video I'd like to show you both
techniques<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:53.420> first<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.600> show<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> on

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
techniques now first I'll show you on

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
techniques now first I'll show you on
the<00:00:55.620> beanie<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.219> unfortunately<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the beanie here unfortunately with the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.939 
the beanie here unfortunately with the
bag<00:00:57.270> once<00:00:57.660> you've<00:00:57.930> got<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.289> braided<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
bag once you've got those braided you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
bag once you've got those braided you
really<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.430> secure<00:00:59.730> down<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> last<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
really do secure down the last one so I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
really do secure down the last one so I
couldn't<00:01:00.870> undo<00:01:01.289> them<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.250> hat<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
couldn't undo them in the hat you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
couldn't undo them in the hat you can
take<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.239> loops<00:01:03.570> back<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.430> put<00:01:05.430> them

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
take these loops back out and put them

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
take these loops back out and put them
back<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> well<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.740> series

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
back in it well so here I have a series

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
back in it well so here I have a series
of<00:01:08.490> four<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.150> pattern<00:01:09.450> I've<00:01:09.540> used<00:01:09.750> quad

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
of four this pattern I've used quad

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.929 
of four this pattern I've used quad
troubles<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> could<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> any<00:01:10.920> tall<00:01:11.250> stitch<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
troubles it could be any tall stitch and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
troubles it could be any tall stitch and
to<00:01:12.630> begin<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> want<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> sort

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to begin when you want to make the sort

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.740 
to begin when you want to make the sort
of<00:01:14.430> braids<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.850> round<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.540> going

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
of braids in the round what you're going

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.920 
of braids in the round what you're going
to<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.500> pick<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> starting<00:01:17.930> stitch

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to have to do is pick a starting stitch

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890 
to have to do is pick a starting stitch
here<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.060> let's<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> starting

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
here so let's make this the starting

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.260 
here so let's make this the starting
stitch<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.790> stitch<00:01:24.060> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
stitch and for that first stitch in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
stitch and for that first stitch in
order<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> create<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> real<00:01:25.020> loop<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> I'm

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
order to create a real loop with it I'm

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.350 
order to create a real loop with it I'm
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> twist<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> once<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
going to twist it once I'm just going to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.679 
going to twist it once I'm just going to
flip<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.060> creates<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
flip it over like so so it creates a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.530 
flip it over like so so it creates a
loop<00:01:31.200> space<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> take

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
loop space here then I'm going to take

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.859 
loop space here then I'm going to take
the<00:01:33.750> next<00:01:34.409> stitch<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.850> without<00:01:36.180> twisting<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the next stitch and without twisting it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.160 
the next stitch and without twisting it
I'm<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> pull<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.479> through<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I'm going to pull it right through that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
I'm going to pull it right through that
loop<00:01:40.759> like<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:41.960> okay

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
loop like so okay

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
loop like so okay
then<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> continue<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
then I'm going to continue to do that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
then I'm going to continue to do that
with<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> next<00:01:45.659> loop<00:01:47.930> like<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.220> next

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
with the next loop like so and the next

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.039 
with the next loop like so and the next
loop<00:01:50.790> pull<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.659> through<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.049> then

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
loop pull it up through like so and then

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.950 
loop pull it up through like so and then
the<00:01:55.170> next<00:01:55.320> loop<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.969> continue<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the next loop and continue that all the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.880 
the next loop and continue that all the
way<00:01:58.350> around<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.490> Hat<00:01:59.990> now<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> fingerless

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
way around the Hat now or the fingerless

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.990 
way around the Hat now or the fingerless
mitts<00:02:02.189> depending<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.549> which<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.790> I'm<00:02:02.880> making

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
mitts depending on which one I'm making

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999 
mitts depending on which one I'm making
here<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.420> making<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> Hat<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.680> people<00:02:04.890> have

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
here I'm making the Hat some people have

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.170 
here I'm making the Hat some people have
mentioned<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:05.729> their<00:02:06.000> hook

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
mentioned they like to use their hook

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
mentioned they like to use their hook
for<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> great<00:02:07.530> chance<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
for this and this is a great chance to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
for this and this is a great chance to
use<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.789> comfortable<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
use it if you're more comfortable you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.550 
use it if you're more comfortable you
can<00:02:10.110> grab<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.800> next<00:02:11.129> loop<00:02:12.319> pull<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.440> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
can grab that next loop pull it on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.120 
can grab that next loop pull it on
through

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
through

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730 
through
grab<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.760> next<00:02:15.060> loop<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.570> pull<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.650> on

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
grab that next loop and pull it on

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.950 
grab that next loop and pull it on
through<00:02:16.820> my<00:02:17.820> twins<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.150> slightly<00:02:18.390> bigger<00:02:18.690> hook

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
through my twins a slightly bigger hook

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.660 
through my twins a slightly bigger hook
this<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> same<00:02:19.560> hook<00:02:19.770> size<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.220> used<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
this is the same hook size I used on the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.610 
this is the same hook size I used on the
head<00:02:20.790> itself<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.240> believe<00:02:22.070> like<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.590> put<00:02:25.590> on

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
head itself I believe like so put on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.710 
head itself I believe like so put on
through<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.270> when<00:02:27.600> you're

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
through now you can see when you're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.180 
through now you can see when you're
making<00:02:27.900> these<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.620> sometimes<00:02:29.100> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
making these you can have sometimes I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.030 
making these you can have sometimes I
call<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.460> laddering<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
call it laddering you can see the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.350 
call it laddering you can see the
stitches<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.070> between<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.180> want<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
stitches in between you just want to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.870 
stitches in between you just want to
kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.600> pull<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.410> squish<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.700> braid

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
kind of pull and squish the braid

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.570 
kind of pull and squish the braid
together<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.360> your<00:02:36.450> fingers<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
together with your fingers like so and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.380 
together with your fingers like so and
before<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.880> know<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.000> you'll<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.300> good

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
before you know it you'll have a good

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.300 
before you know it you'll have a good
looking<00:02:39.660> braid<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.620> come<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
looking braid then as you come all the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.400 
looking braid then as you come all the
way<00:02:41.340> back<00:02:41.430> around<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.240> very<00:02:42.570> last<00:02:42.930> loop<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
way back around that very last loop is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.690 
way back around that very last loop is
going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.590> go<00:02:43.740> through<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> loop<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.370> front<00:02:44.400> of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
going to go through the loop in front of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
going to go through the loop in front of
it<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.050> loop<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.440> put<00:02:46.680> over<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it and that's the loop you put over the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.970 
it and that's the loop you put over the
button<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.810> finish<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.230> off<00:02:49.350> I'm<00:02:49.620> not<00:02:49.680> going<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
button to finish it off I'm not going to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
button to finish it off I'm not going to
make<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.190> sit<00:02:50.370> through<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.610> whole<00:02:50.640> thing

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
make you sit through the whole thing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.970 
make you sit through the whole thing
here<00:02:51.210> you've<00:02:51.810> got<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> idea<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
here you've got the idea this is a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.850 
here you've got the idea this is a
horizontal<00:02:53.630> braid<00:02:54.630> worked<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.710> way

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
horizontal braid worked all the way

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.070 
horizontal braid worked all the way
around<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:57.000> how<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> make<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.570> one<00:02:57.780> now

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
around that's how I make that one now

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.920 
around that's how I make that one now
for<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:01.310> vertical<00:03:02.310> braid<00:03:02.520> here<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.780> beach

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
for the vertical braid here in the beach

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.030 
for the vertical braid here in the beach
bag<00:03:04.200> there<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> couple<00:03:04.650> different<00:03:05.010> ways

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
bag there are a couple different ways

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.280 
bag there are a couple different ways
you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.480> basically<00:03:06.990> if

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
you can do this one but basically if

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.930 
you can do this one but basically if
you're<00:03:07.410> working<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.830> rounds<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.430> rows<00:03:08.640> you're

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you're working in rounds or rows you're

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.030 
you're working in rounds or rows you're
going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.930> make<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.260> loops<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.860> get

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
going to want to make the loops that get

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040 
going to want to make the loops that get
pulled<00:03:11.250> each<00:03:11.400> other<00:03:11.720> pull<00:03:12.720> through<00:03:12.930> each

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
pulled each other pull through each

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.200 
pulled each other pull through each
other<00:03:13.290> excuse<00:03:13.680> me<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.130> large<00:03:14.550> chain<00:03:14.970> loops

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
other excuse me with large chain loops

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.290 
other excuse me with large chain loops
these<00:03:15.420> were<00:03:15.600> chains<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.080> 12<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:17.460> have<00:03:17.730> here

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
these were chains of 12 and I have here

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.570 
these were chains of 12 and I have here
a<00:03:19.040> small<00:03:20.040> close-up<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.240> undone<00:03:22.250> all<00:03:23.250> worked

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
a small close-up of it undone all worked

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.670 
a small close-up of it undone all worked
in<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> same<00:03:24.000> color<00:03:24.270> here<00:03:24.540> now<00:03:25.050> for<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.440> day

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
in the same color here now for the day

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.320 
in the same color here now for the day
at<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.800> beach<00:03:25.890> bag<00:03:26.310> pattern<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.940> alternated

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
at the beach bag pattern I alternated

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600 
at the beach bag pattern I alternated
rows<00:03:27.720> where<00:03:28.050> you'd<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> chain<00:03:29.040> two<00:03:29.280> skip

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
rows where you'd have a chain two skip

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.310 
rows where you'd have a chain two skip
two<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.660> next<00:03:30.720> row<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.080> would<00:03:31.170> be

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
two and then on the next row it would be

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.000 
two and then on the next row it would be
a<00:03:31.350> chain<00:03:31.680> 12<00:03:32.130> skip<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.180> chain<00:03:33.480> space<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
a chain 12 skip that chain space then a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.970 
a chain 12 skip that chain space then a
chain<00:03:35.370> two<00:03:35.610> then<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.210> chain<00:03:36.540> 12<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.830> this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
chain two then a chain 12 and in this

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
one working up the bag for the first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.680 
one working up the bag for the first
chain<00:03:40.920> twelve<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.460> would<00:03:41.580> pull<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.850> under<00:03:42.390> that

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
chain twelve I would pull it under that

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.120 
chain twelve I would pull it under that
chain<00:03:43.020> two<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:45.170> then<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.890> next

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
chain two like so then go up to the next

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.450 
chain two like so then go up to the next
chain<00:03:47.520> 12<00:03:47.880> pull<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.870> under<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.860> chain<00:03:50.190> two

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
chain 12 pull it it under the chain two

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.170 
chain 12 pull it it under the chain two
below<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.800> then<00:03:52.800> through<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.940> chain

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
below it and then through the chain

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.100 
below it and then through the chain
twelve<00:03:54.480> below<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:56.270> again<00:03:57.270> for<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.840> next

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
twelve below that again for the next

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.170 
twelve below that again for the next
chain<00:03:58.290> twelve<00:03:58.590> pull<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.310> underneath<00:03:59.640> the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
chain twelve pull it underneath the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.840 
chain twelve pull it underneath the
chain<00:04:00.420> two<00:04:00.690> below<00:04:01.020> it<00:04:01.200> or<00:04:01.530> behind<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.580> guess<00:04:02.730> you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
chain two below it or behind I guess you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.090 
chain two below it or behind I guess you
could<00:04:02.970> say<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.450> then<00:04:04.260> through<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:05.070> loop

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
could say and then through the loop

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.120 
could say and then through the loop
below<00:04:05.460> it<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:06.480> can<00:04:06.600> see<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:06.960> a<00:04:07.130> looping

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
below it you can see we get a looping

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.560 
below it you can see we get a looping
chain<00:04:08.430> going<00:04:08.700> vertically<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.270> there<00:04:09.450> and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
chain going vertically up there and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.730 
chain going vertically up there and
again<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.870> could<00:04:09.960> use<00:04:10.110> your<00:04:10.260> stitch<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.590> pull

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
again you could use your stitch to pull

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.200 
again you could use your stitch to pull
those<00:04:10.860> through<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> find<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.670> easier<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
those through if you find it easier I

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.050 
those through if you find it easier I
like<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.870> use<00:04:12.960> my<00:04:13.110> fingers<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:14.060> everybody

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
like to use my fingers but everybody

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.000 
like to use my fingers but everybody
does<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.360> their<00:04:15.480> own<00:04:15.510> way<00:04:15.690> now<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> want<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.830> say

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
does it their own way now I want to say

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.490 
does it their own way now I want to say
I<00:04:17.310> did<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.060> chain<00:04:18.359> two<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.870> every<00:04:19.140> other<00:04:19.260> row

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
I did the chain two on every other row

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.960 
I did the chain two on every other row
for<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:19.799> day<00:04:19.890> at<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.070> beach<00:04:20.220> bag<00:04:20.489> because

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
for the day at the beach bag because

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.600 
for the day at the beach bag because
that<00:04:21.239> pattern<00:04:22.049> was<00:04:22.320> worked<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.310> pull<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.490> out

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
that pattern was worked and pull it out

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.580 
that pattern was worked and pull it out
again<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.840> pattern<00:04:25.140> was<00:04:25.229> worked<00:04:25.440> with

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
again that pattern was worked with

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.170 
again that pattern was worked with
alternating<00:04:25.979> colors<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:26.760> wanted<00:04:27.030> all<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
alternating colors and I wanted all the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.650 
alternating colors and I wanted all the
loops

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
loops

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.960 
loops
for<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.870> braid<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.410> be<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> same<00:04:28.830> color<00:04:29.130> so

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
for the braid to be the same color so

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.030 
for the braid to be the same color so
that<00:04:30.000> was<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> way<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.510> skip<00:04:30.930> having<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.800> blue

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
that was a way to skip having the blue

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.060 
that was a way to skip having the blue
rose<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.670> part<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.600> braid<00:04:33.840> if<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.920> were

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
rose be part of the braid if I were

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.710 
rose be part of the braid if I were
doing<00:04:35.310> something<00:04:35.550> different<00:04:36.210> if<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.390> wanted

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
doing something different if I wanted

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.860 
doing something different if I wanted
every<00:04:37.350> row<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.710> participate<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.880> braid<00:04:39.630> I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
every row to participate in the braid I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.840 
every row to participate in the braid I
would<00:04:40.110> make<00:04:40.320> these<00:04:40.530> chain<00:04:40.860> loops<00:04:41.070> smaller<00:04:41.490> and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
would make these chain loops smaller and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.150 
would make these chain loops smaller and
then<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.480> would<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:42.750> go<00:04:43.080> ahead<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.710> braid

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
then I would just go ahead and braid

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.250 
then I would just go ahead and braid
them<00:04:44.460> right<00:04:44.940> on<00:04:45.090> through<00:04:45.450> each<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:46.020> maybe

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
them right on through each one maybe

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.740 
them right on through each one maybe
twisting<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.860> first<00:04:47.040> one<00:04:47.250> again<00:04:47.600> like<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.720> did

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
twisting the first one again like I did

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.770 
twisting the first one again like I did
with<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> hat<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.560> then<00:04:49.710> pulling<00:04:50.070> them<00:04:50.250> through

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
with a hat and then pulling them through

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.360 
with a hat and then pulling them through
now<00:04:51.780> another<00:04:52.110> alternative<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.950> might<00:04:53.160> find

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
now another alternative you might find

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.370 
now another alternative you might find
in<00:04:53.640> patterns<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.300> use<00:04:54.480> this<00:04:54.720> technique<00:04:55.110> is

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
in patterns that use this technique is

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.410 
in patterns that use this technique is
that<00:04:56.040> some<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.340> them<00:04:56.580> will<00:04:56.760> have<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.090> twist

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
that some of them will have you twist

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.440 
that some of them will have you twist
the<00:04:57.750> loop<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.170> every<00:04:58.830> row<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.910> would<00:05:00.210> put

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
the loop on every row so you would put

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.200 
the loop on every row so you would put
the<00:05:00.630> loop<00:05:00.810> through<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.580> twist<00:05:02.580> before<00:05:03.000> you

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
the loop through and twist before you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.180 
the loop through and twist before you
put<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.480> another<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.500> next<00:05:04.680> one<00:05:04.830> through

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
put the another one the next one through

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.700 
put the another one the next one through
and<00:05:05.460> that's<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.300> another<00:05:06.540> variation<00:05:07.380> on

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
and that's just another variation on

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.860 
and that's just another variation on
this<00:05:07.890> technique<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:08.850> I<00:05:09.150> think<00:05:09.570> now<00:05:09.690> you've

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
this technique but I think now you've

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.540 
this technique but I think now you've
got<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.140> basic<00:05:10.470> idea<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.860> how<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.220> can<00:05:11.430> do

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
got the basic idea of how you can do

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.420 
got the basic idea of how you can do
braiding<00:05:12.000> with<00:05:12.120> crochet<00:05:12.420> loops<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.430> by

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
braiding with crochet loops and by

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.760 
braiding with crochet loops and by
working<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:15.030> with<00:05:15.390> chains<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.170> this<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:16.620> can

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
working it with chains like this you can

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.800 
working it with chains like this you can
do<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:17.120> vertically<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.270> pattern<00:05:18.630> unless

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
do it vertically in the pattern unless

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.940 
do it vertically in the pattern unless
of<00:05:18.930> course<00:05:18.960> you're<00:05:19.170> working<00:05:19.260> sideways<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
of course you're working sideways and it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.640 
of course you're working sideways and it
would<00:05:20.040> be<00:05:20.100> horizontal<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:20.880> then<00:05:21.690> by<00:05:22.620> doing

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
would be horizontal and then by doing

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.290 
would be horizontal and then by doing
tall<00:05:23.100> stitches<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.640> this<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.030> can<00:05:24.150> work<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
tall stitches like this you can work a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.990 
tall stitches like this you can work a
horizontal<00:05:25.140> row<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.440> braids<00:05:25.710> or<00:05:26.100> if<00:05:26.850> you're

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
horizontal row of braids or if you're
