okay<00:00:02.550> so<00:00:02.879> what<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:03.899> was<00:00:04.110> just<00:00:04.140> talking<00:00:04.529> about

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
okay so what I was just talking about

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.350 
okay so what I was just talking about
here<00:00:05.359> these<00:00:06.359> parts<00:00:06.930> from<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.250> strike<00:00:09.090> pack

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
here these parts from the strike pack

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.890 
here these parts from the strike pack
that<00:00:09.929> go<00:00:10.139> right<00:00:10.500> there<00:00:11.000> these<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.389> also<00:00:12.599> act

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
that go right there these can also act

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.860 
that go right there these can also act
as<00:00:13.049> swords<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.849> that's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.660> nice

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
as swords so that's a really nice

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
as swords so that's a really nice
addition<00:00:16.369> because<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.609> kit<00:00:17.850> does<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.330> come

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
addition because this kit does not come

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570 
addition because this kit does not come
with<00:00:18.720> any<00:00:18.750> beam<00:00:19.170> sabers<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> does<00:00:20.369> come

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
with any beam sabers so it does come

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.700 
with any beam sabers so it does come
with<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:20.910> nice<00:00:21.240> big<00:00:21.720> swords<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.590> see

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
kind of like and of course these wires

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.150 
kind of like and of course these wires
right<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.500> move<00:02:47.680> them<00:02:47.799> any<00:02:47.980> way

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
that moving backwards so it goes back

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
that moving backwards so it goes back
and<00:02:52.900> hits<00:02:53.049> him<00:02:53.319> in<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.470> face<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:54.450> wanted<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.510> but

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
you get two sets of trigger hands for

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.390 
you get two sets of trigger hands for
these<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.380> use<00:03:20.530> them<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.829> these<00:03:21.069> guns

back<00:07:01.870> heavy<00:07:02.400> not<00:07:03.400> that<00:07:03.849> much<00:07:04.180> but<00:07:05.050> it<00:07:05.199> still

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
back heavy not that much but it still

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.980 
back heavy not that much but it still
does<00:07:07.259> influence<00:07:08.259> the<00:07:08.889> pose<00:07:09.340> ability<00:07:09.940> of<00:07:10.630> the

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
Gundam when you're standing it up I'll

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.269 
Gundam when you're standing it up I'll
definitely<00:07:13.750> recommend<00:07:14.349> getting<00:07:14.560> an<00:07:14.800> action

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:15.279 
definitely recommend getting an action

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.240 
definitely recommend getting an action
base<00:07:15.490> for<00:07:15.819> this<00:07:16.620> it<00:07:17.620> would<00:07:17.710> be<00:07:17.860> really<00:07:18.099> good

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
base for this it would be really good

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.550 
base for this it would be really good
for<00:07:18.310> the<00:07:18.550> dynamic<00:07:19.060> poses<00:07:19.360> you<00:07:20.139> know<00:07:20.259> have<00:07:20.440> it

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
for the dynamic poses you know have it

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.969 
for the dynamic poses you know have it
flying<00:07:20.949> and<00:07:21.279> shooting<00:07:21.460> it's<00:07:21.729> double<00:07:22.060> pistols

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
flying and shooting it's double pistols

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.790
