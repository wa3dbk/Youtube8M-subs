00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.770 
the Martin stage I'm a humble would be
somehow<00:02:14.950> some<00:02:15.250> way<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.640> end<00:02:15.670> empower<00:02:16.239> your

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
somehow some way in the end empower your

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.559 
somehow some way in the end empower your
effect<00:02:17.140> pedal<00:02:17.530> board<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.239> came<00:02:19.239> up<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
effect pedal board so came up with a

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.509 
effect pedal board so came up with a
little<00:02:19.780> metal<00:02:20.440> more<00:02:20.650> power<00:02:20.860> supply<00:02:21.250> over<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
little metal more power supply over to

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.490 
little metal more power supply over to
the<00:02:21.610> custom<00:02:21.970> lining<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.569> power

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the custom lining on the power

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.699 
the custom lining on the power
transformer<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.940> high<00:02:25.120> board<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:26.560> what

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
transformer with high board and so what

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.530 
transformer with high board and so what
we<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.430> an<00:02:27.549> eat<00:02:27.819> switch<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
we do is we have an eat switch for the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.660 
we do is we have an eat switch for the
trim<00:02:28.989> learner<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.290> turn<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.830> off<00:02:29.920> we

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
trim learner to turn it on and off we

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.050 
trim learner to turn it on and off we
also<00:02:30.819> route<00:02:31.209> pedal<00:02:31.569> power<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.650> same

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
also route pedal power out that same

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.240 
also route pedal power out that same
cable<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.500> foot<00:02:35.680> switch<00:02:35.799> that<00:02:36.099> controls

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
cable so the foot switch that controls

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.530 
cable so the foot switch that controls
the<00:02:36.819> tremolo<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.780> setting<00:02:38.319> out<00:02:38.440> on<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.540> double

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the tremolo is setting out on the double

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.759 
the tremolo is setting out on the double
board<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> front<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.170> stage<00:02:41.409> and

their<00:02:42.099> three<00:02:42.370> conductors<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:43.030> brought<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
their three conductors we brought a

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.869 
their three conductors we brought a
double<00:02:43.599> power<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.989> daisy<00:02:44.980> chain<00:02:45.310> off<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.730> that

a single volume single filter on the
front<00:03:18.470> end<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.070> we<00:03:19.970> wanted<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.240> expand<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
front end and we wanted to expand that a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.440 
front end and we wanted to expand that a
little<00:03:20.840> bit<00:03:21.110> for<00:03:21.320> more<00:03:21.470> tunnel<00:03:21.830> shaping<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.700> we

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
little bit for more tunnel shaping so we

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.950 
little bit for more tunnel shaping so we
got<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:24.050> got<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.350> front<00:03:24.560> end<00:03:24.710> gain<00:03:25.370> control

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
got we got the front end gain control

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.620 
got we got the front end gain control
and<00:03:26.960> then<00:03:27.170> we<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.550> shrimp<00:03:28.630> difficulty

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
and then we have a shrimp difficulty

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.230 
and then we have a shrimp difficulty

unlabeled his top cut it's not a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.100 
unlabeled his top cut it's not a
traditional<00:03:37.100> top<00:03:37.640> cut<00:03:37.880> circuit<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.020> a

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
traditional top cut circuit like in a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.100 
traditional top cut circuit like in a
box<00:03:39.350> what<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> more<00:03:42.820> dynamic<00:03:44.110> tone

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
box what this is is a more dynamic tone

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.650 
box what this is is a more dynamic tone
control<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:45.920> off<00:03:46.100> of<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.310> 50s<00:03:46.520> am<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.540> it's

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
control like off of a 50s am but it's

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.380 
control like off of a 50s am but it's
supposed<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.990> be<00:03:48.140> as<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.320> burger<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:49.520> what<00:03:50.270> you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
supposed to be as a burger so what you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.020 
supposed to be as a burger so what you
can<00:03:50.510> do<00:03:50.630> here<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.230> overall<00:03:51.770> tone<00:03:52.040> shaping<00:03:52.580> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
can do here is overall tone shaping and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.720 
can do here is overall tone shaping and
it<00:03:53.180> gives<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.480> some<00:03:53.690> other<00:03:53.950> abilities<00:03:54.950> you

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
it gives you some other abilities you

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.640 
it gives you some other abilities you
can<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.570> turn<00:03:56.690> this<00:03:56.870> tone<00:03:57.110> stack<00:03:57.380> all<00:03:57.560> the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
can you can turn this tone stack all the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.290 
can you can turn this tone stack all the
way<00:03:57.770> off<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.160> control<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.730> amp<00:03:58.910> with<00:03:59.090> this

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
way off and control the amp with this

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.870 
way off and control the amp with this
totally<00:04:00.200> different<00:04:00.500> tonality<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:01.520> can<00:04:01.700> max

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
totally different tonality you can max

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.470 
totally different tonality you can max
everything<00:04:02.390> in<00:04:02.720> control<00:04:03.730> with<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:04.940> guy<00:04:05.150> for

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
everything in control with this guy for

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.810 
everything in control with this guy for
different<00:04:05.810> voices<00:04:06.200> or<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.400> can<00:04:07.550> use<00:04:07.580> in

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
different voices or you can use in

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.340 
different voices or you can use in
conjunction<00:04:08.000> which<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.600> how<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.750> do<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.050> and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
conjunction which is how I do it and

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.890 
conjunction which is how I do it and
really<00:04:09.830> how<00:04:10.010> its<00:04:10.190> intended<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.820> that's<00:04:11.390> you

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
really how its intended and that's you

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.990 
really how its intended and that's you
get<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.080> nice<00:04:12.290> voice<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.400> need<00:04:13.550> a<00:04:13.580> slightly

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
get a nice voice if you need a slightly
