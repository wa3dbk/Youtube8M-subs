00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
around the girls and leave at least

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.239 
around the girls and leave at least
enough<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.700> stretch<00:01:34.600> over<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.890> right<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.189> I

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
enough to stretch over all right so I

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.749 
enough to stretch over all right so I
cut<00:01:39.579> out<00:01:40.140> most<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.409> material<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.429> left

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
just a bit to stretch over the girls

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.569 
just a bit to stretch over the girls
still<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.749> probably<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> little<00:01:47.859> bit<00:01:48.069> too<00:01:48.369> much

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
still is probably a little bit too much

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.859 
still is probably a little bit too much
so<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.090> might<00:01:49.270> cut<00:01:49.479> more<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:51.130> after<00:01:51.869> cutting

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869

the correct length all we have to do is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.440 
the correct length all we have to do is
