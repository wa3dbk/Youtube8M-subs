00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.329 
Eva Marie or WMV for hiring Eva Marie

don't think Nikki sees her sister s

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:11.639 
don't think Nikki sees her sister s
competition<00:07:10.809> because<00:07:11.110> they're<00:07:11.289> a<00:07:11.319> package

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:11.649 
competition because they're a package

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:13.049 
competition because they're a package
deal<00:07:12.069> you<00:07:12.279> know<00:07:12.399> they're<00:07:12.550> attacking<00:07:12.849> team

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:13.059 
deal you know they're attacking team

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:14.639 
deal you know they're attacking team
they're<00:07:13.209> not<00:07:13.330> going<00:07:13.569> anywhere<00:07:13.929> so<00:07:14.529> he

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:14.649 
they're not going anywhere so he

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:16.529 
they're not going anywhere so he
probably<00:07:15.279> doesn't<00:07:15.639> see<00:07:15.669> her<00:07:15.879> own<00:07:15.999> sister<00:07:16.209> as<00:07:16.509> a

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:16.539 
probably doesn't see her own sister as a

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:18.839 
probably doesn't see her own sister as a
threat<00:07:16.929> so<00:07:17.619> she<00:07:17.679> doesn't<00:07:18.189> care<00:07:18.339> if<00:07:18.519> she<00:07:18.699> looks

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:18.849 
threat so she doesn't care if she looks

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:20.850 
threat so she doesn't care if she looks
like<00:07:19.089> her<00:07:19.269> because<00:07:19.479> they're<00:07:19.719> sisters<00:07:20.139> so<00:07:20.709> she

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
like her because they're sisters so she

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.339 
like her because they're sisters so she
cares<00:07:21.219> if<00:07:21.399> it<00:07:21.550> of<00:07:21.759> a<00:07:21.879> non-relative<00:07:22.479> looks<00:07:23.139> like

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.349 
cares if it of a non-relative looks like

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:26.489 
cares if it of a non-relative looks like
her<00:07:23.559> and<00:07:23.860> now<00:07:24.099> she's<00:07:24.399> competition<00:07:25.119> so<00:07:25.689> I<00:07:25.719> guess

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:26.499 
her and now she's competition so I guess

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:28.319 
her and now she's competition so I guess
that's<00:07:26.739> what<00:07:26.889> she<00:07:27.069> meant<00:07:27.249> when<00:07:27.519> she<00:07:27.849> got<00:07:28.059> mad

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:28.329 
that's what she meant when she got mad

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:32.219 
that's what she meant when she got mad
at<00:07:28.599> the<00:07:29.110> whole<00:07:29.159> thing<00:07:30.159> uh<00:07:30.539> I<00:07:31.539> don't<00:07:31.929> know<00:07:32.050> what
