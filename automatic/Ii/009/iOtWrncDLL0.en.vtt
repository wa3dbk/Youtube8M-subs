00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
because it reminds me why I started

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.480

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
doing it in the first place sometimes I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.600 
doing it in the first place sometimes I
think<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.880> takes<00:02:54.740> eating<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> shitty<00:02:56.070> food<00:02:56.370> to

think it takes eating the shitty food to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.640 
think it takes eating the shitty food to
remind<00:02:56.940> us<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.240> oh<00:02:57.420> yeah<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.080> why<00:02:58.440> I'm
