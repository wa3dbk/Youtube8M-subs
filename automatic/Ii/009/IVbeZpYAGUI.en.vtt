00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
he won't be suited he needs to be right

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.190 
he won't be suited he needs to be right

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
as I said he doesn't have the best pace

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.490 
as I said he doesn't have the best pace

passing<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.740> absolutely<00:02:32.280> amazing<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
passing is absolutely amazing now in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.180 
passing is absolutely amazing now in
4231<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.959> seemed<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.380> though<00:02:34.410> he<00:02:34.770> was<00:02:34.890> further

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
4231 it seemed as though he was further

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.680 
4231 it seemed as though he was further
up<00:02:35.430> than<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> striker<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.300> was<00:02:36.450> quite<00:02:36.630> good

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
up than the striker which was quite good

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
up than the striker which was quite good
because<00:02:37.290> his<00:02:37.800> shooting<00:02:38.130> isn't<00:02:38.370> too<00:02:38.730> bad<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
because his shooting isn't too bad the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.820 
because his shooting isn't too bad the
only<00:02:39.150> problem<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.810> said<00:02:39.870> was<00:02:40.200> his<00:02:40.350> pace<00:02:40.620> so

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
only problem as I said was his pace so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.500 
only problem as I said was his pace so
as<00:02:41.190> long<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.580> don't<00:02:41.760> rely<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.030> three<00:02:42.360> balls

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
as long as you don't rely on three balls

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.180 
as long as you don't rely on three balls
two<00:02:42.630> heavily<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.500> shouldn't<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.010> all

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
two heavily a you shouldn't have all

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.220 
two heavily a you shouldn't have all
that<00:02:44.340> much<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.880> problem<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.750> him<00:02:46.020> now

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
that much of a problem with him now

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
that much of a problem with him now
where<00:02:46.440> he's<00:02:46.770> heading<00:02:47.310> seemed<00:02:47.550> already<00:02:47.880> scored

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
where he's heading seemed already scored

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.729 
where he's heading seemed already scored
a<00:02:48.209> header<00:02:48.330> or<00:02:48.570> two<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:48.989> me<00:02:49.110> which<00:02:49.530> was<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
a header or two for me which was a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.320 
a header or two for me which was a
little<00:02:49.980> bit<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.220> surprise<00:02:50.370> considering<00:02:51.060> how

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
little bit of a surprise considering how

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
little bit of a surprise considering how
like<00:02:51.600> shorty<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.350> how<00:02:52.500> average<00:02:52.890> his<00:02:53.040> head

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
like shorty is and how average his head

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.940 
like shorty is and how average his head
and<00:02:53.340> stats<00:02:53.610> art<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.510> yeah<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.380> dribbling

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
and stats art but yeah it is dribbling

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.830 
and stats art but yeah it is dribbling
and<00:02:56.160> like<00:02:56.400> core<00:02:56.970> strength<00:02:57.360> seemed<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.720> be

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and like core strength seemed to be

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.090 
and like core strength seemed to be
really<00:02:58.050> impressive<00:02:58.560> he<00:02:58.680> seemed<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.070> very

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
really impressive he seemed to be very

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.710 
really impressive he seemed to be very
very<00:02:59.520> capable<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.090> holding<00:03:00.209> onto<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.600> ball

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
very capable of holding onto the ball

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.500 
very capable of holding onto the ball
but<00:03:01.260> his<00:03:01.440> main<00:03:01.739> main<00:03:02.370> stat<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.940> obviously

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
but his main main stat is obviously

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.810 
but his main main stat is obviously
other<00:03:03.840> than<00:03:04.080> his<00:03:04.200> free<00:03:04.440> kicks<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:04.860> are<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
other than his free kicks are are the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.430 
other than his free kicks are are the
the<00:03:06.239> past<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.690> his<00:03:06.720> passing<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.320> dribbling

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the past in his passing and dribbling

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.380 
the past in his passing and dribbling
absolutely<00:03:08.280> outstanding<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> want<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
review a bit short and concise because

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.050 
review a bit short and concise because
there<00:03:16.800> isn't<00:03:17.010> too<00:03:17.130> much<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.430> say<00:03:17.610> about<00:03:17.730> like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
there isn't too much to say about like

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.820 
there isn't too much to say about like
players<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.840> play<00:03:19.019> in<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.170> midfield<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.709> as

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
players that play in the midfield but as

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.400 
players that play in the midfield but as
I<00:03:19.950> said<00:03:20.010> he<00:03:20.549> had<00:03:20.730> deserves<00:03:21.360> an<00:03:21.510> 8.5<00:03:22.080> out<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.320> 10

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
I said he had deserves an 8.5 out of 10

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.530 
I said he had deserves an 8.5 out of 10
he's<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.799> little<00:03:23.640> bit<00:03:23.880> on<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> expensive<00:03:24.269> side

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
he's a little bit on the expensive side

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.240 
he's a little bit on the expensive side
especially<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.320> time<00:03:25.530> recording<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:25.950> don't<00:03:26.160> if

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
especially the time recording I don't if

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.100 
especially the time recording I don't if
that'll<00:03:26.519> go<00:03:26.580> down<00:03:26.610> by<00:03:27.209> his<00:03:27.420> passing<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
that'll go down by his passing and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.840 
that'll go down by his passing and
dribbling<00:03:28.290> are<00:03:28.680> absolutely<00:03:29.190> fantastic<00:03:29.220> the

dribbling are absolutely fantastic the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.820 
dribbling are absolutely fantastic the
card<00:03:30.090> stats<00:03:30.360> don't<00:03:30.600> even<00:03:30.930> give<00:03:31.080> him<00:03:31.170> enough

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
card stats don't even give him enough

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.620
