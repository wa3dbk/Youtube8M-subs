Hello everybody, Piruk's here for a special video about MineToys

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
You can buy'em on www.minetoys.com

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.000
The factory will then send it to you in a couple of days

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You'll receive a big box with a litte box inside it, containing your fig

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They include a thank you sheet for buying their expensive stuff as well

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Because the toys are not quite free, if you see what I mean

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Your fig is in a XXL bubble wrap, protected from damage

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's made of Sandstone by the way.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Let's talk about this fig now !

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.500
Here it is, it's 4,7 inches. I bought it for X-Mas.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll talk about what everybody forget to mention: the texture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
As you may see, it's kind of porous, a little bit like stone, you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's... well, grainy, but I can't give another example of such a texture

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.000
But it's neither smooth nor unpleasant anyway

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The skin itself is well made, with some exceptions, 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.000
such as the arms which have some sort of "continuity" on the head.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.000
Maybe it's just because my skin is simple in terms of colors.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's worth the money IMO

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's hollow and quite "light transparent" BTW

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So yeah... We're done with this little review video !

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I advise you to buy if you have the money, I think it's worth it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.000
A big thanks to Minetoys.com for crafting me my skin

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
...And it stands on its feet FTW ! :P

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.000
