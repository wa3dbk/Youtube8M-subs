00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey John so here's the basic setup for

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.309 
hey John so here's the basic setup for
how<00:00:03.959> do<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.080> run<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.740> whistle<00:00:05.310> smoke<00:00:05.520> under<00:00:05.730> DCF

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
how do I run a whistle smoke under DCF

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.500 
how do I run a whistle smoke under DCF
right<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.470> I've<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.740> lion<00:00:07.919> lzw<00:00:08.639> savings<00:00:09.360> Z

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
right here I've the lion lzw savings Z

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.799 
right here I've the lion lzw savings Z
4000<00:00:10.200> basically<00:00:10.759> for<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> power<00:00:11.940> source<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.570> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
4000 basically for a power source so I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.760 
4000 basically for a power source so I
have<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.889> positive<00:00:14.370> negative<00:00:14.900> from<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.440> pole

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
have my positive negative from one pole

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.910 
have my positive negative from one pole
coming<00:00:17.550> into<00:00:17.820> fixed<00:00:18.449> voltage<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.990> okay<00:00:19.710> so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
coming into fixed voltage one okay so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.580 
coming into fixed voltage one okay so
that's<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.820> isolated<00:00:21.449> power<00:00:21.630> supply<00:00:22.109> for

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
throttle I have the same power coming to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.229 
throttle I have the same power coming to
variable<00:00:29.130> voltage<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.480> okay<00:00:31.430> now<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.759> don't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

have<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.890> leads<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.880> fixed<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
have any leads going from fixed out to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.190 
have any leads going from fixed out to
the<00:00:37.050> track<00:00:37.320> okay<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.219> only<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.969> from<00:00:39.899> my

right here okay so this is the track
I'll<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.989> running<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.530> running<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'll be running I'm running a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
I'll be running I'm running a
Pennsylvania<00:00:50.640> m1b<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.449> swing<00:00:51.719> bail<00:00:52.050> smoking

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
Pennsylvania m1b with swing bail smoking

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.209 
Pennsylvania m1b with swing bail smoking
whistle<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> stuff<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
whistle and all the all the stuff and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.119 
whistle and all the all the stuff and
features<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.090> usually<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
features that I usually have so the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
features that I usually have so the
process<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.609> is<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> power<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.590> fixed

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
process is is you need to power up fixed

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.600 
process is is you need to power up fixed
voltage<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.809> one<00:01:03.809> okay<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> power<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
voltage in one okay you need to power up

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
voltage in one okay you need to power up
that<00:01:05.640> throttle<00:01:06.060> first<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.600> I'll<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.840> ahead<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that throttle first so I'll go ahead and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.179 
that throttle first so I'll go ahead and
open<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.659> red<00:01:10.500> light<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.010> on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
open that up I see my red light is on on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.780 
open that up I see my red light is on on
my<00:01:11.310> tiu<00:01:11.810> okay<00:01:12.810> once<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.530> powered<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
my tiu okay once that is powered and I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.340 
my tiu okay once that is powered and I
can<00:01:15.000> acknowledge<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> power<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
can acknowledge that the power is

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
can acknowledge that the power is
powered<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> tiu<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.820> we'll<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.060> go

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
powered up on the tiu and we'll then go

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.999 
powered up on the tiu and we'll then go
ahead<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.310> throttle<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.729> variable<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
ahead and throttle up my variable one

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.420 
ahead and throttle up my variable one
okay<00:01:23.009> let<00:01:23.310> me<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.280> now

button<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:21.540> off<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.960> running<00:02:23.060> okay<00:02:24.060> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
button and I'm off and running okay so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.250 
button and I'm off and running okay so
now<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.190> control<00:02:26.670> my<00:02:26.910> speed<00:02:26.970> I'll<00:02:27.600> roll

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
now just to control my speed I'll roll

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.650 
now just to control my speed I'll roll
up<00:02:30.200> make<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:31.440> faster<00:02:32.210> I'll<00:02:33.210> take<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.570> around

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
up make it go faster I'll take it around

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.160 
up make it go faster I'll take it around
the<00:02:33.870> loop<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.380> once<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:36.330> we'll<00:02:36.690> wait<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the loop here once and we'll wait for it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
the loop here once and we'll wait for it
to<00:02:37.290> come<00:02:37.470> back<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.950> I'm<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.520> 12<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.880> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
to come back here and I'm at 12 and a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.050 
to come back here and I'm at 12 and a
half<00:02:47.970> volts<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.880> pretty

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
half volts right now and it's a pretty

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
half volts right now and it's a pretty
big<00:02:51.270> loop<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:52.140> bump<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> up<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.770> get<00:02:52.890> it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
big loop so on bump it up and get it

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.449 
big loop so on bump it up and get it
over<00:02:53.250> here

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
over here

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.809 
over here
quicker

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.899 

okay<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.140> you'll<00:02:58.290> see<00:02:58.590> now<00:02:59.189> that<00:02:59.219> I<00:02:59.519> can

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
okay but you'll see now that I can

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.920 
okay but you'll see now that I can
control<00:03:00.560> my<00:03:01.560> speed<00:03:02.060> from<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.120> thumb<00:03:03.450> wheel<00:03:03.659> on

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
control my speed from the thumb wheel on

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.000 
control my speed from the thumb wheel on
the<00:03:04.140> bulk<00:03:04.349> screen<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.829> as<00:03:07.980> simple

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the bulk screen it really is as simple

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.479

press the whistle and my friend that is

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.050 
press the whistle and my friend that is
it<00:04:00.799> if<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.889> want<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.189> turn<00:04:02.310> off<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.609> engine<00:04:02.909> all

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
it if I want to turn off the engine all

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.250 
it if I want to turn off the engine all
I<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.689> volt<00:04:03.870> screen<00:04:04.200> just<00:04:04.530> go<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.219> to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
I do on the volt screen just go down to

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.170 
I do on the volt screen just go down to
zero<00:04:07.260> point<00:04:07.439> zero<00:04:07.560> volts<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.939> will<00:04:09.030> shut

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
zero point zero volts and it will shut

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.360 
zero point zero volts and it will shut
down<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:10.139> I<00:04:10.500> think<00:04:10.560> as<00:04:10.829> long<00:04:10.859> as<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.189> follow

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
down so I think as long as you follow

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.309 
down so I think as long as you follow
the<00:04:11.609> sequence<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:12.239> powering<00:04:12.780> up<00:04:12.900> fixed

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the sequence of powering up fixed

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.360 
the sequence of powering up fixed
voltage<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.920> one<00:04:14.420> first<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:16.620> make<00:04:16.799> sure<00:04:17.039> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
voltage in one first just make sure that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.310 
voltage in one first just make sure that
before<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.849> power<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.660> variable<00:04:19.169> you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
before you power up the variable you

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.830 
before you power up the variable you
have<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.620> power<00:04:19.829> up<00:04:20.220> fixed<00:04:20.639> voltage<00:04:20.789> in<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.479> so

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
have to power up fixed voltage in one so

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.589 
have to power up fixed voltage in one so
even<00:04:22.470> for<00:04:22.620> shutdown<00:04:23.039> what<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.280> do<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.419> go

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
even for shutdown what I do is I go

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.629 
even for shutdown what I do is I go
ahead<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.080> I'll<00:04:25.560> power<00:04:25.800> down<00:04:26.009> the<00:04:26.190> variable

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
ahead and I'll power down the variable

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.330 
ahead and I'll power down the variable
voltage<00:04:26.759> in<00:04:27.150> one<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.169> then<00:04:28.710> I'll<00:04:28.889> power<00:04:29.099> down

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
voltage in one and then I'll power down

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.379 
voltage in one and then I'll power down
fixed<00:04:29.759> voltage<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.830> with<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.009> setup

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
fixed voltage in one and with that setup

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.200 
fixed voltage in one and with that setup
your<00:04:33.389> big<00:04:33.570> boy<00:04:33.750> should<00:04:34.110> run<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.490> ordered

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
your big boy should run just as ordered

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.180 
your big boy should run just as ordered
and<00:04:37.520> hopefully<00:04:38.520> with<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.800> sequence

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
and hopefully with this and the sequence

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.060 
and hopefully with this and the sequence
I'm<00:04:41.550> hoping<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.289> luck<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:43.770> it

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
I'm hoping that you have luck with it

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.029 
I'm hoping that you have luck with it
because<00:04:44.539> if<00:04:45.539> if<00:04:46.289> you<00:04:46.440> don't<00:04:46.590> get<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.830> working

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
because if if you don't get it working

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.600 
because if if you don't get it working
in<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.550> sequence<00:04:47.910> then<00:04:48.830> there's<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.919> there's

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
in that sequence then there's a there's

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.129 
in that sequence then there's a there's
something<00:04:50.880> going<00:04:51.090> on<00:04:51.240> with<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.750> sequence

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
something going on with the sequence

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.350 
something going on with the sequence
that<00:04:52.199> doesn't<00:04:52.530> be<00:04:52.590> involved<00:04:53.099> but<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.490> should

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
that doesn't be involved but that should

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.620 
that doesn't be involved but that should
do<00:04:54.479> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
do it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.099 
do it
alright<00:04:55.349> John<00:04:55.560> take<00:04:55.919> care
