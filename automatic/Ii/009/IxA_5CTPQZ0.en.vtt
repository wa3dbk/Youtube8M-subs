00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the widgets and here we go and again

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.670 
the widgets and here we go and again
still<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.890> quick<00:01:26.330> instantaneous<00:01:27.619> open<00:01:28.619> up

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.920 
have any issues with any slowdown or lag
so<00:01:40.049> let's<00:01:40.200> bring<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.439> back<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> regular

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
so let's bring this back to a regular

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
so let's bring this back to a regular
wallpaper<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> we'll<00:01:43.950> run<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
wallpaper here and we'll run just the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.760 
wallpaper here and we'll run just the
first<00:01:44.820> test<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
first test and that's going to be a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.300 
first test and that's going to be a
quadrant<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.090> let's<00:01:48.390> wait<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.810> guy<00:01:48.990> here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
okay so let's it started quadrant let's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
okay so let's it started quadrant let's
load<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> guy<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.930> I'm

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
load that guy up and here we go I'm

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.670 
load that guy up and here we go I'm
gonna<00:01:58.409> run<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.799> guy<00:01:59.149> now<00:02:00.350> we've<00:02:01.350> read<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
gonna run this guy now we've read and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.069 
gonna run this guy now we've read and
ran<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> several<00:02:02.430> times<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.630> seems<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> be

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
ran it several times and it seems to be

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.200 
ran it several times and it seems to be
really<00:02:04.469> good<00:02:04.619> definitely<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> some<00:02:05.790> cases

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
really good definitely it's some cases

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.790 
really good definitely it's some cases
hits<00:02:07.110> over<00:02:07.710> 5000<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:08.819> bit<00:02:08.910> over<00:02:09.000> 5000<00:02:09.810> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
hits over 5000 little bit over 5000 that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.190 
hits over 5000 little bit over 5000 that
point<00:02:11.069> sometimes<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:12.150> gets<00:02:12.330> Sundance<00:02:12.780> 40

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
point sometimes it gets Sundance 40

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
point sometimes it gets Sundance 40
nine<00:02:13.349> for<00:02:13.739> nine<00:02:13.770> hundred<00:02:14.190> range<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.879> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
nine for nine hundred range but for the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.210 
nine for nine hundred range but for the
most<00:02:15.090> part<00:02:15.209> really<00:02:16.020> good<00:02:16.410> scores<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.129> we'll

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
most part really good scores and we'll

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.570 
most part really good scores and we'll
see<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.269> wraps<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.500> doing<00:02:20.489> these

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
see that here as it wraps up doing these

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
see that here as it wraps up doing these
operations<00:02:21.269> right<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.959> we'll<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
operations right now and we'll see the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
operations right now and we'll see the
graphical<00:02:23.160> components<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.849> test<00:02:24.120> yet

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
graphical components of this test yet

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.600 
graphical components of this test yet
see<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.050> we<00:02:25.140> could<00:02:25.290> zoom<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.340> see

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
see if we could zoom in here you can see

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490 
see if we could zoom in here you can see
that<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:27.030> doing<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.080> fifty

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
that it's doing that one there fifty

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.020 
that it's doing that one there fifty
eight<00:02:28.560> frames<00:02:28.800> per<00:02:29.069> second<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.790> here

fifty eight frames per second as well so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.309 
fifty eight frames per second as well so
relatively<00:02:33.300> smooth<00:02:33.630> from<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.140> could

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
relatively smooth from what we could

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.800 
relatively smooth from what we could
what<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:34.860> notice<00:02:35.190> here<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.090> there<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.690> with

the<00:02:59.640> total<00:03:00.180> number<00:03:00.540> here<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:02.310> gonna

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the total number here is and it's gonna

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
the total number here is and it's gonna
give<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:03.120> its<00:03:03.720> core<00:03:04.049> 4905<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.220> we

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
give it this time its core 4905 as we

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
give it this time its core 4905 as we
said<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.060> between<00:03:06.209> 4900<00:03:07.079> all<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.709> under

50 100 as we tested out several times so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
50 100 as we tested out several times so
it's<00:03:10.410> still<00:03:10.620> very<00:03:10.860> respectable<00:03:11.640> being<00:03:12.360> at

and<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.430> last<00:03:59.639> test<00:03:59.910> here<00:04:00.120> we're<00:04:00.269> going<00:04:00.420> to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and the last test here we're going to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.330 
and the last test here we're going to
show<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.690> here<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:00.959> just<00:04:01.200> Nina<00:04:01.560> mork<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.099> a

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
show you here is just Nina mork to a

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.699 
show you here is just Nina mork to a
little<00:04:03.060> bit<00:04:03.150> more<00:04:03.359> of<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.540> graphical<00:04:04.079> component

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
little bit more of a graphical component

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.009 
little bit more of a graphical component
and<00:04:04.859> graphical<00:04:05.280> test<00:04:05.489> here<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.910> we<00:04:06.599> ran<00:04:06.840> it

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
and graphical test here and we ran it

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.170 
and graphical test here and we ran it
several<00:04:07.260> times<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> average<00:04:08.370> it

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
several times and on the average it

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.500 
several times and on the average it
gives<00:04:09.389> us<00:04:09.540> approximately<00:04:10.609> 59.1<00:04:11.609> frames<00:04:12.209> per

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
gives us approximately 59.1 frames per

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.470 
gives us approximately 59.1 frames per
second<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.470> even<00:04:14.220> with<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> lot<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.639> shading<00:04:15.239> a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
second so even with a lot of shading a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.379 
second so even with a lot of shading a
lot<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.229> know<00:04:16.430> shadows<00:04:17.430> stuff<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.359> that

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
lot of you know shadows stuff like that

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.659 
lot of you know shadows stuff like that
even<00:04:18.989> smoke<00:04:19.380> effects<00:04:19.919> it's<00:04:20.130> still<00:04:20.370> able<00:04:20.519> to

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
even smoke effects it's still able to

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.940 
even smoke effects it's still able to
maintain<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.150> really<00:04:21.780> great<00:04:21.989> rate<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.530> if

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
maintain a really great rate so if
