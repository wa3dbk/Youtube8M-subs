00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.450 
you want to keep in mind is the size of
the<00:02:04.040> box<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.820> one<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.150> five<00:02:05.420> feet<00:02:05.689> long<00:02:05.960> it's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the box this one is five feet long it's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.669 
the box this one is five feet long it's
deep<00:02:07.460> by<00:02:08.060> 10<00:02:08.360> inches<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:08.959> from<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> front<00:02:09.560> to

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
deep by 10 inches so from the front to

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.800 
deep by 10 inches so from the front to
the<00:02:09.709> back<00:02:09.799> 10<00:02:10.310> inches<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.819> then<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.299> sits<00:02:11.510> up

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the back 10 inches and then it sits up

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.580 
the back 10 inches and then it sits up
10<00:02:12.290> inches<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.459> 10<00:02:13.970> by<00:02:14.209> 10<00:02:14.540> inch<00:02:14.840> by<00:02:15.230> 5

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
10 inches so it's 10 by 10 inch by 5

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.440 
10 inches so it's 10 by 10 inch by 5
feet<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.430> may<00:02:16.549> say<00:02:16.730> wow<00:02:16.939> that's<00:02:17.239> really

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
feet now you may say wow that's really

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.119 
feet now you may say wow that's really
big<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.409> know<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> keys<00:02:19.099> to

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
big but you know it's one of the keys to

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.309 
big but you know it's one of the keys to
success<00:02:19.760> because<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.239> want<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.689> lot<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.049> soil

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
success because you want a lot of soil

soil consistently moist and your plants
are<00:02:31.279> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.489> respond<00:02:31.939> to<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.419> in<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.930> way

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
are going to respond to it in this way

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.290 
are going to respond to it in this way
now<00:02:33.889> the<00:02:33.980> final<00:02:34.400> thing<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.669> want<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.879> keep<00:02:35.029> in

now the final thing you want to keep in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
now the final thing you want to keep in
mind<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.660> designing<00:02:35.780> window<00:02:36.350> boxes<00:02:36.860> the

placement and maintenance of the plants

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.200 
placement and maintenance of the plants
you<00:02:39.050> can<00:02:39.620> see<00:02:39.860> some<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.250> these<00:02:40.340> plants<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:41.030> be

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
you can see some of these plants can be

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.900 
you can see some of these plants can be
very<00:02:41.480> foga<00:02:41.900> SH<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:42.740> let's<00:02:42.950> talk<00:02:43.190> about<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
very foga SH but let's talk about the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.610 
very foga SH but let's talk about the
habit<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> plant<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.050> instance<00:02:45.170> I've<00:02:45.470> got

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
habit of the plant for instance I've got

habit of the plant for instance I've got
this<00:02:45.740> coleus<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.700> which<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> come

this coleus here which is going to come

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.000 
this coleus here which is going to come
up<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.870> middle<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:48.410> more<00:02:48.650> upright

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
up in the middle and it's more upright

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.490 
up in the middle and it's more upright
I've<00:02:49.400> got<00:02:49.880> an<00:02:49.970> upright<00:02:50.480> plant<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:51.320> in<00:02:51.410> an

errs<00:02:54.080> coming<00:02:54.530> across<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:55.040> front<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.060> think

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
errs coming across the front so think

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.640 
errs coming across the front so think
about<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.870> want<00:02:57.140> those<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.530> will

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
tall ones in the back don't be afraid to

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.790 
tall ones in the back don't be afraid to
pinch<00:03:02.090> these<00:03:02.330> back<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:03.140> sweet<00:03:03.380> potato<00:03:03.710> vine

pinch these back the sweet potato vine
will<00:03:04.550> certainly<00:03:04.940> need<00:03:05.180> some<00:03:05.450> editing<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.110> well

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
will certainly need some editing as well

will certainly need some editing as well
this<00:03:06.800> coleus<00:03:07.340> otherwise<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.000> will<00:03:08.090> take<00:03:08.390> over
