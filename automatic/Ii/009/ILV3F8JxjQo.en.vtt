00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:19.939
 Mezzanine 1 and am 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.939

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.130
 Pirates only in Soft Cell Clemens to Chancellery 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 so 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.599
 Actions area 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.200
 And in order to get momentum also new CEO of the basic requirements and so on 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:35.829

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.100
 to play 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.990
 that's on 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.030
 and action stuff to play 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.809
 So what that is already full by um um 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.120
 Minister also 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.080
 m to certain areas where you play together 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.660
 to certain areas without restriction 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.200
 and there we have that is just basic requirement that you have the quest 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.230
 ever gets 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 yes Ballack Western promote 17 o'clock NISO more exactly has 18 to 20 that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.199
 Spice substance 20 days 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.010
 Amnesty right serious 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.610
 for a total of 42 quests ran for this series 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.990
 promised 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.610
 both 20 it is about 20 1 something then comes och mat 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 the respective type emergency brake was already at 41 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 and then again the last deadline if that would come now 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.729
 At the group, even if one of the main engine of harvest weather we would be close 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.490
 by 42 quests 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.439
 Dr 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.910
 for the reward and the quests 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.179
 are for one 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.919
 Gold and also costly victims of their normal mode lately 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.730
 50 percent 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.390
 It may also be that later on the sea Wollstadt will pay so much 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.800
 game 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560
 and the so-called Ministry awards 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.700
 you can do this 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.010
 exchange for weapons 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.440
 the players fight and race 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.460
 currently on 15 award for one of the neighboring municipalities 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.190
 He also expects that on Monday I have to go as far as going 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.799
 that already gives everyone to look like an unloved one though 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:13.999
 around 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.459
 and then I think I'll come back later so I'm sure 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.609
 Place again on the driest scope 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.969
 they are from the GGG at 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 available so and some trigger 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.199
 But I'm never sure about the adequate consumption and that's why 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.549
 I love them and spend hours still reserved at Potsdam 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.389
 and then later 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.869
 Spyker sells you players or just then made 1000 for that other one 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
 which will eventually come 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.149
 and he wants to say so Schenk draw Winds of Change is probably two more 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.749
 other chapters 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.949
 those about packet tears 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.169
 in the first part we do now and now around 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.289
 &amp; Cie instead 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:02.859
 from the 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.559
 to liberate 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.789
 it should probably also on 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.859
 subsequently the area delicately attracted no noticeable noticeable 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.979
 Unfortunately, I can never do so many and from courts but so so Finder then 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.149
 appearance 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:21.439
 in the speed races in the other two chapters is supposed to be the isolation of names 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.449
 Can it be addressed there again, do not believe in it 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.209
 the assassin Miku always comes for the fruit 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.069
 what's more, as already said, whose month is still available Marburg gets 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.189
 you experience points 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.549
 for the opponents are the same level as Momo but it's just more 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.009
 there is something in the ladies of the fine relatively ICEs 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.269
 because all the more of those there are the stars and Ustorf to remember 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.679
 Warrior of this 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.010
 these explosions 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.049
 which is triggered by the death 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.139
 because of that 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
 nice for sports with Nemo 9 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.369
 more arrive too 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.669
 Roads Astra to the Knesset before finally stands 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.899
 the 10th 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.569
 the center of curling who will be 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.899
 unsteady laps with Ouzo 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:14.589
 Israel's win conspicuous 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 there Sasse kicked Quest 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.739
 Dr. Norbert to see coughing 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.680
 you can cork on the ball to the shop 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.710
 as a costume 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.309
 There are even more second 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:32.689
 Kölsch who even the leather Pacult but individually by more than 6 euros 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.409
 yes and Russes tassel 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.440
 can grow the quests and can solve it 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.419
 and it's about saying that 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.419
 Ministry of unity around which holds for the ranks Nikon of the fallen 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.629
 are responsible and that's what we do now 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.099
 more Peter Vollmann that is relatively stump 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.789
 I have to say so 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:56.790
 but also 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.060
 nervous Martin Weiser outbreaks Siemens but he reckon 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.639
 you can die without guts without need 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.789
 I know that I'm dying here now 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.360
 you do not think so but earning so many examiners get results 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.339
 among them 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.940
 they are no longer able to embrace the crisp 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.650
 because especially the opponents also to third for 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.710
 they are partly on 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 his team NetApp 1 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:24.930
 from m 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.930
 normal so PVG playing game adapted 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.999
 For example, you have the mind and the sperm 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.320
 with the opponents is naturally always more fictitious it should the attributes earlier 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.930
 can go out 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.930
 and to dive Dr Marinic beer by the sea 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.139
 just like that 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.419
 you do not have to conquer the borders of the whole area. "You just walk 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.129
 Only meters are often changing and so are Steinkamp and van der Rough Springs 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.950
 Wonder fountains and 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.950
 kill those 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.389
 Mistrust can not help that 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.229
 State of open text only cuts though so be that 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.169
 that's what many see 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.139
 Access might suspect 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.150
 a part that is already 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
 and not in the field the know-how around 0 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.150
 but otherwise 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.779
 you would actually be pretty good origin 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.199
 you've seen that »Christop Brain already has the next cash management 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.419
 should start the motto 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.119
 Voigt came 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.780
 Gumpp alone at the stream are 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.750
 Auer me then managed Farmers with Güstrow - so a man of action 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.750
 fails because they did not train the outpost 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.400
 so can make small prey 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.229
 to take the weapon as well as last 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.510
 more Rech CDU keeps the current tenant dead in the same 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.270
 Close to Crescent 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.889
 Hoffenheim's manufacturer actually 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.180
 as revenue that is easily recognizable 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.590
 on and to the left of it are the animals in an NPC attitude as well 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.289
 in the GdG at St 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.530
 the program points are so the whole can keep up but still 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.080
 around 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.960
 which suggest that these pages then go up 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.309
 is available to the normal player 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:22.699
 I find the skinheads in Spandau hard to choke 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:25.449
 they simply kept their brains cool 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.449
 Schüttorf KNA is not my case though 

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:33.599
 he has the otherwise one pulls unfortunately never so center now the included 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.899
 are usually very small 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.929
 I have been able to do so then they are quite interesting 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.729
 Dr Euro around 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.460
 theirs 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.900
 Therefore, do not despair if Ernst is not that you can barely 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.409
 to get yet 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:52.500
 if you do not like to play Hartmut 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.500
 No that they still can not play you can also play with several characters 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:58.330
 that's what Kiev does 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.979
 both awards 

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:05.360
 and 4 Wismar enjoy again beautiful photo accommodation and sound of it 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.660
 and even Krupp looks
