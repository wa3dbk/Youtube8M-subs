of an amplifier what are we looking at

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.470 
of an amplifier what are we looking at
you've<00:03:53.750> got<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> 50<00:03:54.410> watt<00:03:54.590> head<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:57.290> gain<00:03:57.530> levels

you've got a 50 watt head to gain levels
3<00:03:59.480> band<00:03:59.690> EQ<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:02.590> something<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.709> we<00:04:03.859> picked

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
3 band EQ and something that we picked

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.470 
3 band EQ and something that we picked
up<00:04:04.340> from<00:04:04.419> guitarists<00:04:05.950> he<00:04:06.950> plays<00:04:07.220> rhythm<00:04:07.579> but

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
up from guitarists he plays rhythm but

guitarists<00:04:11.389> will<00:04:11.540> roll<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.560> volumes<00:04:13.090> but

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
guitarists will roll the volumes but

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.690 
guitarists will roll the volumes but
what<00:04:14.389> they<00:04:14.569> would<00:04:14.750> like<00:04:15.099> was<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.250> have<00:04:16.430> to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
what they would like was to have to

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.879 
what they would like was to have to
master<00:04:17.150> volumes<00:04:17.539> so<00:04:18.079> they<00:04:18.260> could<00:04:18.470> switch

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
master volumes so they could switch

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.779 
master volumes so they could switch
footswitch<00:04:19.849> between<00:04:20.419> two<00:04:20.859> brilliant<00:04:21.859> simple

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
footswitch between two brilliant simple

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.960 
footswitch between two brilliant simple
idea<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.660> we<00:04:23.780> incorporated<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.770> but<00:04:25.669> it's<00:04:25.820> a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
idea so we incorporated that but it's a

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.050 
idea so we incorporated that but it's a
you've<00:04:26.240> got<00:04:26.510> basically<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.560> 50<00:04:28.010> watt<00:04:28.190> true

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
you've got basically a 50 watt true

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.440 
you've got basically a 50 watt true

Celestion<00:04:38.860> loaded<00:04:39.750> cabinet<00:04:40.889> again<00:04:41.889> the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
Celestion loaded cabinet again the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.100 
Celestion loaded cabinet again the
design<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.780> cosmetics<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.710> bill<00:04:45.960> but<00:04:46.960> we

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
design of the cosmetics is bill but we

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.909 
design of the cosmetics is bill but we
we<00:04:47.830> produced<00:04:48.280> too<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.350> idea<00:04:50.740> has

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
we produced too and so the idea has

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.159 
we produced too and so the idea has
resurfaced<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.910> they<00:04:52.510> will<00:04:52.840> be<00:04:53.139> in

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
resurfaced and they will be in

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.310 
resurfaced and they will be in
production<00:04:54.419> we<00:04:55.419> have<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.600> listener<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.080> thing

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
production we have a listener this thing

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:19.500 
production we have a listener this thing
all<00:04:57.010> right<00:04:57.250> there<00:04:57.700> you<00:04:57.790> go<00:04:57.910> have<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> bash

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.770 

what<00:05:20.410> channel<00:05:20.920> was<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.310> that's<00:05:21.850> on<00:05:22.330> the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
what channel was that that's on the

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
what channel was that that's on the
drive<00:05:23.050> channel<00:05:23.590> with<00:05:23.980> extra<00:05:24.370> game<00:05:24.610> boost<00:05:25.800> on

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
drive channel with extra game boost on

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.120 
drive channel with extra game boost on
the<00:05:28.350> second<00:05:29.350> volume<00:05:29.890> setting<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:32.020> if<00:05:33.010> you

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
the second volume setting so if you

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.520 
the second volume setting so if you
wanted<00:05:33.400> it<00:05:33.550> back<00:05:34.030> on<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.420> clean

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:57.950 

that's<00:05:38.530> very<00:05:38.650> bit<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:38.950> that<00:05:39.040> then

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.740 

cool<00:05:58.960> pretty<00:05:59.289> snappy<00:05:59.620> all<00:05:59.949> right<00:06:00.130> so<00:06:00.550> this<00:06:01.449> can

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
cool pretty snappy all right so this can

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.180 
cool pretty snappy all right so this can
do<00:06:01.870> a<00:06:01.900> lot<00:06:02.080> of<00:06:02.199> things<00:06:02.410> then<00:06:02.710> huh<00:06:02.949> well<00:06:05.190> that's

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
do a lot of things then huh well that's

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.339 
do a lot of things then huh well that's
what<00:06:06.430> we're<00:06:06.580> here<00:06:06.759> for<00:06:06.960> rock<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:07.990> roll
