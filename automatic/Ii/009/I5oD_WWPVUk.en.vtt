00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
both but I got to tell you for a lot of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.560 
both but I got to tell you for a lot of
my<00:02:24.380> work<00:02:24.410> they<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.280> need<00:02:25.730> my<00:02:25.910> files<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.540> be

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
my work they I need my files to be

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.729 
my work they I need my files to be
life-size<00:02:27.470> basically<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:30.530> just

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
life-size basically and so you just

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.130 
life-size basically and so you just
can't<00:02:31.070> beat<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.820> size<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> file<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.870> get

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
can't beat the size of the file you get

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.640 
can't beat the size of the file you get
with<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:34.190> beats<00:02:34.880> any<00:02:35.180> DSLR<00:02:35.870> out<00:02:36.440> there

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
with this it beats any DSLR out there

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.530 
with this it beats any DSLR out there
for<00:02:36.860> sure<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.610> massive<00:02:38.000> sensor<00:02:38.299> honest

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
for sure it's a massive sensor honest

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.759 
for sure it's a massive sensor honest
you're<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.870> get<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.530> big

you're going to get it it's like a big

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.620 
you're going to get it it's like a big
piece<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.100> film<00:02:40.310> exit<00:02:40.760> that's<00:02:40.970> exactly<00:02:41.420> what

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
piece of film exit that's exactly what

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.479 
piece of film exit that's exactly what
it<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.780> except<00:02:42.530> better<00:02:42.769> because<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.250> faster

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
it is except better because it's faster
