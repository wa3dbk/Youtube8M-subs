00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 - how was the recovery after a displacement 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.560
 Mr. Mayor 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.899
 - how does this week normally 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.089
 with a scrub Saturday the godson of the training this afternoon 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.000
 like a week from heaven's arm 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.370
 less than one in three consecutive draws 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.830
 personally I prefer to move slowly but surely towards the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.790
 maintenance after his visit 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.990
 it is sure that every time we take very seriously 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.920
 an option for the maintenance so that's a good thing we only take one 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.130
 point that 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.570
 cook and 0% and often it's true that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.340
 daley for the compromise I understand that do or have made the difference in the end 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.000
 of season so 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.770
 we are still satisfied 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.219
 this season the coach was the least amount of play time 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.700
 did you think about retiring 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.850
 - longest pole 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 it's true that I did not play these 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450
 these last two months 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.690
 but we are ashamed 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.090
 we try to work in coma 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.800
 all we can see there I have made happy the last two months so 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.840
 this is a good thing 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 it takes to continue 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 so the president lansana told 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.920
 because I draw from this team no 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.660
 I think a team like any other now 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 At home you have to take points from the customer 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.820
 and therefore the one that compares a lot of individualities even if the man m 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.140
 at least that's what the lorientais collective stronger 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.320
 cordero that's why we are sitting on common values 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.409
 in any case we know very well what we can produce what we can do 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.030
 especially if you are 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 we are all in shape 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.870
 breach 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 he does not look too much at the teams there abdulkadir what we prefer 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.380
 especially focus on bottom of catch and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.880
 that's all
