00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.650
 Point lighthouse stake bars with my 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.650
 family 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:14.360
 first we took the chair and crushed it 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 with a bottle of wine so that 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.490
 they will be strangled 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.829
 in a thin cardboard carton 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.070
 I did the drawing of the development of the prism 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:29.759
 hexagonal that forms the base and pablo the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.489
 cut and made the shape and with them 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.839
 we went back to the clay 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 this base also which is a hexagon 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.780
 we also take it out of it 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.519
 cardboard and the structure also of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 val auster there is a cylinder that holds 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.110
 the light and by and right in the cylinder there are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.770
 a balance that I have also done with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.660

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.690

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.790
 contraption of cao cola boxes 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.550

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.120
 and part of santi bruces which we put 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.130
 as a shell and we put some 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.729
 wires out there to do a little bit 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.450
