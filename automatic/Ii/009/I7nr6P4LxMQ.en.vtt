00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.920 

the<00:00:11.549> union<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.150> purchased<00:00:12.540> from<00:00:12.629> cubes

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
the union can be purchased from cubes

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.709 
the union can be purchased from cubes

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
for speed comm for $14 which is also the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.090 
for speed comm for $14 which is also the
cheapest<00:00:16.139> price<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.560> I've<00:00:16.650> seen<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
cheapest price that I've seen in the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.640 
cheapest price that I've seen in the
u.s.<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.580> far<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.810> Eugene<00:00:19.170> feels<00:00:19.410> very

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
u.s. so far the Eugene feels very

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.680 
u.s. so far the Eugene feels very
similar<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:20.310> leaing<00:00:20.670> they've<00:00:21.210> kept<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
similar to the leaing they've kept that

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.939 
similar to the leaing they've kept that
light<00:00:21.960> fast

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
light fast

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
light fast
clicky<00:00:23.310> feel<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.759> the<00:00:23.880> leading<00:00:24.210> had<00:00:24.449> but

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
clicky feel that the leading had but

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.450 
clicky feel that the leading had but
managed<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> make<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.589> feel<00:00:25.830> much<00:00:26.070> smoother

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
managed to make it feel much smoother

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
managed to make it feel much smoother
overall<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.089> my<00:00:27.150> opinion<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> very

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
overall in my opinion it's like a very

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.040 
overall in my opinion it's like a very
well<00:00:28.919> broken<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.429> liing<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.539> only<00:00:30.720> problem

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
well broken and liing the only problem

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
well broken and liing the only problem
that<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> had<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.430> still

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that I had with it is that it still

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.340 
that I had with it is that it still
feels<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.060> tad<00:00:33.240> more<00:00:33.300> blocky<00:00:33.810> than<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.170> would

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
feels a tad more blocky than I would

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.400 
feels a tad more blocky than I would
prefer<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:36.090> Ewing<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.810> perfect<00:00:37.200> speed

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
prefer the Ewing has the perfect speed

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
prefer the Ewing has the perfect speed
for<00:00:37.650> me<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.730> slow<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.149> something

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
for me it's not as slow as something

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
for me it's not as slow as something
like<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> ution<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.039> fast<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
like the ution but it's not as fast as a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
like the ution but it's not as fast as a
Guanyin<00:00:42.120> completely<00:00:43.050> controllable<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.739> me

Guanyin completely controllable for me
and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> no<00:00:44.670> issues<00:00:45.030> handling<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:46.460> corner

design there isn't a whole lot to say

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.310 
design there isn't a whole lot to say
it's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.219> straightforward<00:00:59.670> design

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
it's a very straightforward design

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's a very straightforward design
corners<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.469> hollowed<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
corners are hollowed out and that just

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
corners are hollowed out and that just
still<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.879> those<00:01:03.059> small<00:01:03.210> tracks<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> reduce

still have those small tracks to reduce
friction<00:01:04.410> there's<00:01:05.309> no<00:01:05.460> crazy<00:01:05.700> rounding<00:01:06.270> of

design<00:01:09.560> one<00:01:10.560> big<00:01:10.770> gripe<00:01:10.980> I<00:01:11.160> have<00:01:11.190> with<00:01:11.550> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
design one big gripe I have with the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
design one big gripe I have with the
design<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.480> corner<00:01:12.810> caps<00:01:13.050> they<00:01:13.650> were

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
design is the corner caps they were

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
design is the corner caps they were
incredibly<00:01:14.400> annoying<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.690> came

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
incredibly annoying and probably came

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.720 
incredibly annoying and probably came
off<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.530> three<00:01:16.710> times<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.250> an<00:01:17.370> average<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
off two to three times in an average of

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.060 
off two to three times in an average of
five<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.780> easily<00:01:18.930> solve<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.590> issue<00:01:19.770> by

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
five you can easily solve this issue by

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
five you can easily solve this issue by
just<00:01:20.280> gluing<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> caps<00:01:20.910> down<00:01:21.180> though<00:01:21.770> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
just gluing the caps down though one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
just gluing the caps down though one
little<00:01:23.040> thing<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.190> mention<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.270> may

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
little thing to mention is that you may

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.360 
little thing to mention is that you may
be<00:01:24.600> tempted<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.230> round<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.980> corners<00:01:26.010> a

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
be tempted to round off the corners a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.030 
be tempted to round off the corners a
little<00:01:26.580> bit<00:01:26.730> but<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:27.690> do<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.710> corners

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
little bit but don't do this the corners

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.320 
little bit but don't do this the corners
were<00:01:29.190> designed<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.060> prevent

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
were designed like this to prevent

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.750 
were designed like this to prevent
corner<00:01:30.750> twisting<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.830> my<00:01:31.920> testing<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
corner twisting and in my testing this

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.100 
corner twisting and in my testing this
is<00:01:32.940> actually<00:01:33.240> proven<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.660> work<00:01:33.750> quite<00:01:34.080> well

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
is actually proven to work quite well

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.950 
is actually proven to work quite well
the<00:01:34.950> cube<00:01:35.190> can<00:01:35.340> still<00:01:35.580> corner<00:01:35.940> twist<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the cube can still corner twist but it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
the cube can still corner twist but it
didn't<00:01:37.200> seem<00:01:37.350> nearly<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.860> easy<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.550> twist<00:01:38.790> as

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
didn't seem nearly as easy to twist as

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.930 
didn't seem nearly as easy to twist as
some<00:01:39.330> other<00:01:39.480> cubes<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> market<00:01:40.940> popping

some other cubes on the market popping
on<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.210> cube<00:01:42.480> has<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> slight<00:01:43.110> issue<00:01:43.260> for

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
on this cube has been a slight issue for

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.160 
on this cube has been a slight issue for

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
me it's nothing major maybe every one in

me it's nothing major maybe every one in
20<00:01:46.500> solves<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> pop<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
20 solves I would get a pop but it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.240 
20 solves I would get a pop but it
wasn't<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.900> edge<00:01:49.080> piece<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.160> an

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
wasn't just an edge piece it was an

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
wasn't just an edge piece it was an
entire<00:01:50.520> row<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> pieces<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:52.050> might<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> due

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
entire row of pieces this might be due

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
entire row of pieces this might be due
to<00:01:52.800> my<00:01:53.040> incredibly<00:01:53.520> loose<00:01:53.670> tensions<00:01:54.150> though

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
to my incredibly loose tensions though

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.540 
to my incredibly loose tensions though
and<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.050> cube<00:01:55.290> may<00:01:55.440> not<00:01:55.650> pop<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.070> badly<00:01:56.460> on

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and the cube may not pop so badly on

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.540 
and the cube may not pop so badly on
tighter<00:01:56.820> tensions<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:58.010> actually<00:01:59.010> forgot<00:01:59.400> to

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
tighter tensions I actually forgot to

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.040 
tighter tensions I actually forgot to
take<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.730> video<00:01:59.970> of<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.360> stickers<00:02:00.720> before

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
take a video of the stickers before

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.570 
take a video of the stickers before
replacing<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.650> with<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.890> preferred<00:02:02.250> shades

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
replacing it with my preferred shades

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.910 
replacing it with my preferred shades
but<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.450> recall<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.350> standard<00:02:04.680> mode

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but if I recall it's just standard mode

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.070 
but if I recall it's just standard mode
shades<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.610> by<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.510> sure<00:02:06.750> hope<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
shades and by now I would sure hope you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.040 
shades and by now I would sure hope you
know<00:02:07.230> what<00:02:07.350> mo<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.560> shades<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:09.050> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
know what mo you shades look like so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
know what mo you shades look like so
what's<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.319> conclusion<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> cube<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
what's my conclusion on this cube if you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.699 
what's my conclusion on this cube if you
had<00:02:12.180> asked<00:02:12.390> me<00:02:12.450> two<00:02:12.569> weeks<00:02:12.750> ago<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.260> would<00:02:13.680> have

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
had asked me two weeks ago I would have

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.589 
had asked me two weeks ago I would have
completely<00:02:14.189> recommended<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.030> cube<00:02:15.359> after

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
completely recommended this cube after

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.690 
completely recommended this cube after
using<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> while<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.219> was<00:02:17.400> really

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
using it for a while I was really

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.050 
using it for a while I was really
starting<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.269> into<00:02:18.510> 3x3

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
starting to get into 3x3

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.270 
starting to get into 3x3
again<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:20.020> after<00:02:20.260> giving<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.620> fois<00:02:20.830> long<00:02:21.040> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
again but after giving the fois long I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.250 
again but after giving the fois long I
really<00:02:21.640> can't<00:02:21.849> recommend<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.050> hall

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
really can't recommend this the hall

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.870 
really can't recommend this the hall
long<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:23.830> feels<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.250> an<00:02:24.459> upgraded

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
long really feels like an upgraded

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.790 
long really feels like an upgraded
version<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.690> yang<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.110> almost<00:02:26.410> every

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
version of the you yang in almost every

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.860 
version of the you yang in almost every
single<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.970> if<00:02:28.060> you're<00:02:28.209> considering

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
single way so if you're considering

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.750 
single way so if you're considering
getting<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.290> ewing<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.890> would<00:02:30.190> personally

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
recommend you hold off and get the hall

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.680 
recommend you hold off and get the hall
along<00:02:32.739> instead<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.060> if<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.270> already<00:02:34.390> have

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
it's a great cube and you definitely

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.170 
it's a great cube and you definitely
don't<00:02:38.680> need<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.099> immediately<00:02:39.550> rush<00:02:39.849> out<00:02:40.060> an
