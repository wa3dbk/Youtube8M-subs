00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
out of the way if she does react the
main<00:01:53.070> thing<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.520> you're<00:01:53.700> clipping<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
main thing when you're clipping is to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.639 
main thing when you're clipping is to
remember<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.990> you've<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
remember that you've got to have the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
remember that you've got to have the
blades<00:01:55.890> flash<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.000> horses<00:01:57.420> side<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
blades flash on the horses side you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
blades flash on the horses side you
don't<00:01:58.770> tilt<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> Clippers<00:01:59.759> because<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
don't tilt the Clippers because the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.840 
don't tilt the Clippers because the
blades<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:01.619> work<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> knife<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
blades can actually work as a knife so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.389 
blades can actually work as a knife so
that<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> horse<00:02:03.689> does<00:02:04.409> jump<00:02:04.829> back<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
that if the horse does jump back on you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.119 
that if the horse does jump back on you
you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:06.329> actually<00:02:06.570> slash<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.409> horse<00:02:07.619> open

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you can actually slash the horse open

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.729 
you can actually slash the horse open
with<00:02:08.369> those<00:02:08.610> sharp<00:02:09.000> blades<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.289> keep<00:02:10.560> them

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
with those sharp blades so keep them

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.100 
with those sharp blades so keep them
nice<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.950> flat<00:02:11.459> keep<00:02:12.239> them<00:02:12.450> steady<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.959> even

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
nice and flat keep them steady and even

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.340 
nice and flat keep them steady and even
so<00:02:15.069> part<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> clipping<00:02:16.060> process<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.990> you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
so part of the clipping process is you

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.010 
so part of the clipping process is you
need<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> clip<00:02:18.100> against<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.120> grain<00:02:19.450> or<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
need to clip against the grain or the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.520 
need to clip against the grain or the
way<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.740> hair<00:02:20.950> lies<00:02:21.280> flat<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> horse

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
way that the hair lies flat on the horse

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.730 
way that the hair lies flat on the horse
if<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.250> clip<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.790> long<00:02:25.260> continuous<00:02:26.260> lines

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
if you can clip in long continuous lines

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.550 
if you can clip in long continuous lines
and<00:02:27.459> try<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.270> keep<00:02:28.510> your<00:02:28.810> clipper<00:02:29.170> blades

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and try and keep your clipper blades

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.699 
and try and keep your clipper blades
even<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:31.030> will<00:02:31.180> end<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.569> with<00:02:31.630> less<00:02:32.050> lines<00:02:32.380> on

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
even you will end up with less lines on

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.190 
even you will end up with less lines on
the<00:02:32.830> horse<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:34.540> you're<00:02:34.720> clipping<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the horse so when you're clipping the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.900 
the horse so when you're clipping the
back<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> horse<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.250> need<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.700> very

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
back of the horse you need to be very

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.059 
back of the horse you need to be very
careful<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.569> of<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.590> kicking

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
careful because of the the kicking

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.270 
careful because of the the kicking
process<00:02:39.819> here<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:41.290> mirror<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.680> very<00:02:41.770> quiet

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
process here this mirror is very quiet

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.370 
process here this mirror is very quiet
but<00:02:42.730> as<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.180> notice<00:02:43.390> Harald<00:02:43.989> has<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.350> a

but as you can notice Harald has got a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.800 
but as you can notice Harald has got a
hand<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.920> her<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.340> he<00:02:45.520> can<00:02:45.670> feel<00:02:45.970> her<00:02:46.150> moving

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
hand on her so he can feel her moving

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.440 
hand on her so he can feel her moving
he's<00:02:47.320> also<00:02:47.860> standing<00:02:48.370> out<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> kick<00:02:49.150> side

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
he's also standing out of the kick side

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.500 
he's also standing out of the kick side
and<00:02:49.870> he<00:02:50.830> will<00:02:50.980> be<00:02:51.100> very<00:02:51.340> safe<00:02:51.700> he<00:02:52.060> can't<00:02:52.330> get

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and he will be very safe he can't get

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.050 
and he will be very safe he can't get
cow<00:02:52.780> kicked<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.440> he<00:02:53.920> can't<00:02:54.220> cop<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.550> normal

kick for the mane Harold will do it a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.020 
kick for the mane Harold will do it a
low<00:02:59.050> clip<00:02:59.470> along<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.069> first<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
low clip along here first to get the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.270 
low clip along here first to get the
bulk<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:02.019> hair<00:03:02.319> off<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.800> checking<00:03:03.160> that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
bulk of the hair off and checking that

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.059 
bulk of the hair off and checking that
the<00:03:03.459> mare<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.880> not<00:03:04.090> going<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.569> move<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.830> he

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
the mare is not going to move then he

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.240 
the mare is not going to move then he
will<00:03:06.280> go<00:03:06.519> shorter<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.480> go<00:03:07.810> until<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:09.010> hit

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
will go shorter and you go until you hit

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.770 
will go shorter and you go until you hit
the<00:03:09.519> mane<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.080> still<00:03:11.319> close<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:13.480> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
the mane so this is still close but that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.000 
the mane so this is still close but that
bitch<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.410> main<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.519> he<00:03:15.730> will<00:03:15.940> go<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.860> where<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
bitch is main so he will go to where the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.420 
bitch is main so he will go to where the
coach<00:03:18.630> keeps<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.900> mane<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:21.010> don't<00:03:21.220> want<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
coach keeps the mane you don't want to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.130 
coach keeps the mane you don't want to
be<00:03:21.519> taking<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.000> mane<00:03:22.209> off<00:03:22.390> because<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:22.930> need

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
be taking the mane off because we need

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.400 
be taking the mane off because we need
to<00:03:23.290> flat<00:03:23.530> these<00:03:23.769> horses<00:03:25.019> so<00:03:26.019> when<00:03:26.260> you're

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410

the horse if you notice Harold's always
got<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> hand<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.140> horse<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.769> he<00:03:32.980> may<00:03:33.190> not<00:03:33.400> be

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
got a hand on the horse so he may not be

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.250 
got a hand on the horse so he may not be

so you can undo the head stall again
this<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.120> where<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.330> need<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.410> know<00:04:50.530> your

I would always have the owner there
holding<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.640> horse<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.120> they<00:04:58.270> know<00:04:58.480> what's

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
holding the horse so they know what's

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.620 
holding the horse so they know what's
going<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.080> happen<00:04:59.200> hopefully<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.600> a

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
going to happen hopefully and this is a

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.070 
going to happen hopefully and this is a
bit<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.020> fiddly<00:05:03.060> area<00:05:04.060> under<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.510> jaw<00:05:04.750> this

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
bit of a fiddly area under the jaw this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.950 
bit of a fiddly area under the jaw this
mare<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.530> junior<00:05:05.920> mare<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.640> getting<00:05:07.600> in<00:05:07.810> and

out<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:09.000> teeth<00:05:10.000> love<00:05:10.720> is<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.710> bit<00:05:12.010> tricky<00:05:12.400> I

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
out of the teeth love is a bit tricky I

think<00:05:12.700> we'll<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.150> go<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.660> smaller

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
think we'll have to go to the smaller

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.320 
think we'll have to go to the smaller
Clippers<00:05:14.560> we<00:05:14.800> get<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.130> bulk<00:05:15.400> off<00:05:15.640> at<00:05:16.000> the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
Clippers we get the bulk off at the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.390 
Clippers we get the bulk off at the
moment<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:16.990> then<00:05:17.650> we'll<00:05:17.770> move<00:05:17.920> on<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.220> the

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
moment and then we'll move on to the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.700 
moment and then we'll move on to the
smaller<00:05:18.700> pieces<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:19.840> she's<00:05:20.050> tolerating<00:05:20.230> it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
smaller pieces but she's tolerating it

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.120 
smaller pieces but she's tolerating it
fairly<00:05:20.980> well<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:21.520> we'll<00:05:21.820> keep<00:05:22.000> going<00:05:23.130> so

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
fairly well so we'll keep going so

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.430 
fairly well so we'll keep going so
