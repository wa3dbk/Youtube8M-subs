00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:10.585
 Swan geese 

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:17.231
 An old man lived with an old woman; they had a daughter and a little son. 

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:23.800
 Daughter, daughter! - said the mother, - We will go to work, bring you a bun, 

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:29.687
 sew a dress, buy a handkerchief; be smart, take care of your brother, do not walk from the yard. 

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.697
 The older ones are gone, and the daughter has forgotten that she was ordered; 

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.834
 put her brother on the grass under the window, and she ran into the street, 

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:40.417
 played, spree. 

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:47.454
 The swan geese flew in, picked up the boy, carried him away on the wings. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.685
 The girl came, looking - there is no brother! I gasped, rushed back and forth - no. 

00:00:56.912 --> 00:01:02.788
 She clicked, burst into tears, wail, that it would be bad for her father and mother, - 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.332
 brother did not respond! Ran into a clean field; 

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:11.594
 The swan geese darted in the distance and disappeared behind a dark forest. 

00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:18.676
 Geese-swans have long gained ill fame, many shkodili and young children carried away; 

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:26.206
 the girl guessed that they had taken away her brother, rushed to catch up with them. 

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:30.287
 Ran, ran, worth the stove. 

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:34.544
 The stove, the stove, tell me, where did the geese fly? 

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:39.208
 Eat my rye pie, I will say " 

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:44.037
 - Oh, my father wheat is not eaten! The stove did not say. 

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:47.711
 Ran further, it is worth apple trees. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.174
 Apple trees, apple trees, tell me, where did the geese fly? 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.416
 Eat my forest apple, I say. 

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:59.984
 Oh, my father and garden are not eaten! 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.680
 Ran further, there is a milk river, milk and honey. 

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:10.573
 Milk river, milk and honey, where the geese flew? 

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:16.127
 Eat my simple jelly with milk, then I will say. 

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:19.608
 Oh, my father and the cream do not eat! 

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:25.835
 And for a long time if she could run through the fields and wander through the forest, yes, fortunately, a hedgehog was caught; 

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:30.317
 she wanted to push him, was afraid to pin up and asked: 

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.718
 Hedgehog, hedgehog, have you ever seen where the geese flew? 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.582
 There it is! - indicated. 

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:44.520
 Ran - there is a hut on chicken legs, stands, turns. 

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:51.201
 In the hut sits Baba Yaga, muzzle dwelling, foot clay; 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.812
 sits and brother on the bench, playing golden apples. 

00:02:55.002 --> 00:03:01.317
 Sister saw him, crept, grabbed and carried away; 

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:07.808
 and the geese chasing her; villains catch up, where to go? 

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:11.830
 Runs the milk river, milk and honey. 

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:16.755
 - River-mother, hide me! - Eat my jelly! 

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:22.982
 Nothing to do, eat. The river she planted under the cage, the geese flew. 

00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:28.219
 She came out, said: “Thank you!” And again runs with her brother; 

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:33.789
 and the geese returned, flying towards. What to do? Trouble Worth apple trees. 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.270
 - Apple trees, mother apple trees, hide me! “Eat my forest apple!” 

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.083
 Quickly ate. 

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:47.495
 The apple tree blocked it with branches, covered it with leaves; geese flew by. 

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:54.316
 She came out and ran again with her brother, and the geese saw - and behind her; 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.346
 they fly at all, beating their wings, and look at it - they will pull it out of their hands! 

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:04.392
 Fortunately, on the road stove. - Ma'am stove, hide me! 

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:08.160
 Eat my rye pie! 

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:13.465
 The girl quickly pie in the mouth, and she herself in the oven, sat in the stoma. 

00:04:13.845 --> 00:04:20.369
 The geese flew, flew, shouted, shouted, and flew away with nothing. 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:25.955
 And she came running home, and it was good that she managed to come running, 

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:30.560
 and here both father and mother came.
