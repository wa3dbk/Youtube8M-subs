you all of a sudden have a whole new
library<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> pick<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.500> go

library to pick from and you can go
ahead<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.129> make<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:47.969> larger

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ahead and make this a little bit larger

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.799 
ahead and make this a little bit larger
and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> keep<00:00:49.890> dragging<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.690> know

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and then kind of keep dragging you know

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
and then kind of keep dragging you know
the<00:00:51.960> brushes<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.739> pencils<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.670> whatever<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the brushes or pencils or whatever you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.580 
the brushes or pencils or whatever you
want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> work<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.449> whatever<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
want to work with whatever you think you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
want to work with whatever you think you
work<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> regular<00:00:56.250> basis<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.030> right

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
work with on a regular basis just right

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:10.280 
work with on a regular basis just right
over<00:00:57.449> there<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> once<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
over there and once you get that going

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
over there and once you get that going
what<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.090> ahead<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what you can do is just go ahead and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
what you can do is just go ahead and
kind<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.049> bit<00:01:13.290> larger<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.740> it's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
kind of make a little bit larger so it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
kind of make a little bit larger so it's
a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.340> easier<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.850> work<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.450> at

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
a little bit easier to work with and at

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
a little bit easier to work with and at
first<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> hard<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> understand

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
first it's kind of hard to understand

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
first it's kind of hard to understand
how<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:19.110> edit<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:19.710> things

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
how you can actually edit these things

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.260 
how you can actually edit these things
because<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.549> seems<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
because it seems like we're kind of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
because it seems like we're kind of
stuck<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.689> place<00:01:22.040> we<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.369> hold

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stuck in place we have to do is hold

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
stuck in place we have to do is hold
down<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.060> shift<00:01:24.090> button<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> can

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
down the shift button and then you can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
down the shift button and then you can
actually<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
actually move these around so you can

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.380 
actually move these around so you can
get<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:28.080> nice<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.280> neat<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
get them all nice and neat and that in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.350 
get them all nice and neat and that in
one<00:01:30.720> line<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.369> also<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> decide

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
one line and then also if you decide

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
one line and then also if you decide
that<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.659> don't<00:01:33.869> necessarily<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:35.070> like

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that you don't necessarily want one like

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.819 
that you don't necessarily want one like
you<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> eraser<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.570> once<00:01:37.530> again

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you don't want the eraser one once again

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.880 
you don't want the eraser one once again
just<00:01:38.070> hold<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.970> shift<00:01:39.329> button<00:01:39.810> pull<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
just hold down the shift button pull it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.670 
just hold down the shift button pull it
away<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.700> poof<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.299> gone<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.530> we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
away and then poof it's gone and then we

so<00:05:20.620> we<00:05:20.800> have<00:05:20.949> out<00:05:21.099> the<00:05:21.220> blunt<00:05:21.460> chalk<00:05:21.760> 10<00:05:22.690> 20<00:05:23.169> and

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
so we have out the blunt chalk 10 20 and

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.680 
so we have out the blunt chalk 10 20 and
30<00:05:23.699> generally<00:05:24.699> what<00:05:24.849> I<00:05:24.910> would<00:05:25.150> do<00:05:25.330> is<00:05:25.539> I<00:05:25.660> would

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
30 generally what I would do is I would

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.960 
30 generally what I would do is I would
get<00:05:26.050> rid<00:05:26.260> of<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.860> two<00:05:27.010> extremes<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:27.760> get

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
get rid of the the two extremes so get

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.689 
get rid of the the two extremes so get
rid<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:28.180> 30<00:05:28.740> get<00:05:29.740> rid<00:05:29.889> of<00:05:29.949> 10<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.370> don't<00:05:30.520> have

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
rid of 30 get rid of 10 you don't have

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.250 
rid of 30 get rid of 10 you don't have
to<00:05:30.880> do<00:05:30.970> this<00:05:31.150> but<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.479> find<00:05:31.780> it's<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:31.990> really<00:05:32.139> easy

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
to do this but I find it's a really easy

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.050 
to do this but I find it's a really easy
way<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.620> kind<00:05:32.830> of<00:05:32.949> organizing<00:05:33.580> your<00:05:33.669> palate

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
way of kind of organizing your palate

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.260 
way of kind of organizing your palate
and<00:05:34.240> then<00:05:35.050> just<00:05:35.349> go<00:05:35.470> ahead<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.800> click<00:05:36.760> done

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
and then just go ahead and click done

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.450 
and then just go ahead and click done
when<00:05:37.630> you're<00:05:37.960> done<00:05:38.470> with<00:05:38.500> all<00:05:38.770> of<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:38.949> and

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
when you're done with all of that and

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.390 
when you're done with all of that and
now<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:40.060> can<00:05:40.270> go<00:05:40.449> back<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.780> our<00:05:41.080> chalk<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:42.099> you

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
now we can go back to our chalk and you

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.490 
now we can go back to our chalk and you
can<00:05:42.550> see<00:05:42.849> now<00:05:43.090> we<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:43.539> have<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.780> blonde<00:05:44.229> chalk

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
can see now we just have a blonde chalk

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.570 
can see now we just have a blonde chalk
20<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.880> that's<00:05:46.060> one<00:05:46.270> very<00:05:46.630> easy<00:05:47.050> way<00:05:47.289> of

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
20 so that's one very easy way of

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.490 
20 so that's one very easy way of
