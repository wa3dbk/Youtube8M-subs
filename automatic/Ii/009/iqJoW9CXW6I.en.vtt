00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello and welcome to china 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 let point nice to a short 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.890
 introduction video also new user 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.439
 interface in version v 6 I have 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.170
 here my mini ahead does not replace that 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.609
 Explain whole is here is like already 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 mentioned v6 installed and we look 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.199
 give us a look at what's new for the first time 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 the lockscreen changes we have 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.600
 here no longer our beautiful circle 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 we in different directions 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.559
 but the smartphone can move 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.780
 just go upstairs 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.690
 the unlock the whole looks very clean 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.559
 and has a cool animation the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.579
 is perfectly animated but that is also 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.170
 already the only thing we do here 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.520
 We can get notifications 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.600
 shown below I have now 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.930
 for example, calls in absence and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.850
 we can turn right and then 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.890
 automatically starts the camera ours 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.670
 It also closes the cafÃ© 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 again good 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.910
 so much ahead the new design 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.180
 funkschau I like it personally 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.939
 Very much on the presentation was much 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.720
 talked about that the design with 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.400
 circles and lines work the whole 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.430
 We will be right in any case 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.229
 We start to see more often 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.759
 for example with the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.890
 volume control we can do the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.700
 volume control this is like cut 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.950
 A circle is cool when we are here 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.630
 on it we can press different 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 adjust sound settings 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 For example, ring tone volume 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 the recker volume or the voice 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 volume in the ear shell music and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.720
 Of course, flowers are also good then 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.560
 can we press the homebutton once 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.170
 and arrive 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.450
 here you can put it silently for a short time 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 the circle we can restart the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.410
 reboot requires pressure or 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.060
 For example, here we can 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.490
 activate flight mode 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.150
 quite cool animated plane is flying 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.150
 we are in flight mode 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.940
 I have to briefly my meaning again 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940
 enter 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.680
 Well 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 on we go to the new one 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 notification window we have the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.370
 Of course we can still do that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.990
 set that they do more things 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.500
 displayed as the example 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.270
 data consumption has changed 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.230
 the quick start bar so first time 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.880
 we can do it here as usual 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.489
 switch back and forth, however 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.660
 we can use the quick launch toolbar now 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.310
 moved up and down here 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.840
 be cindy it already has everything 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.280
 So we can not integrate anymore 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.780
 determine what happens in here but 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.670
 it's almost everything 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.970
 special feature of emma july also in the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.620
 Of course, the last version is the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.150
 one-handed operation is very optimized 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 that we know that from samsung 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 from htc that up here we have the status 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.850
 Quo pull down the bag already 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.120
 not required i can just hang up 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.630
 the screen with one finger down 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.680
 go and the status bar will be 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.680
 automatically extended 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:40.739
 that's a pretty cool thing the system 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.299
 in itself is a piece of nova 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.340
 become even cleaner on the one hand 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.940
 makes a very small impression and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:56.360
 the performance is simply world class 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.360
 the performance is so good that you 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.340
 So of custom roms one is resp 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.830
 vendor space is not to be a 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.930
 such behavior is not used to yourself 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.549
 vanilla android has on google devices 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.220
 no chance here so the performance 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:22.550
 emma is away the incredible 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.030
 biggest innovation is so we always have 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.300
 still our body to native home 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.130
 buttons, however, has once been 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.750
 We have no warrant changing key 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.090
 More is the option key 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.610
 Now the multitasking opens now 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.900
 window before we had to long on the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.320
 home button click that does not exist 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.240
 more 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.949
 So we open multitasking with that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.850
 we will be two multitasking button 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.430
 different views 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.070
 here we are still used by f5 if 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.360
 we pull the whole thing apart here 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.039
 can we fix this here as well? 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.289
 can lock down with natural course 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.419
 and unlock throw upwards 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.860
 I prefer it the small view to 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.169
 simply clearer there works 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.180
 of course the same way and you down with that 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.180
 circle we can just use the app screen 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.910
 Of course, tepco does not exist either 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.750
 nothing sounds different 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.340
 but you can still do that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.030
 Download and it works too 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.030
 wonderful 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:33.900
 What else has changed? 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:38.639
 Of course we have a revised one 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.169
 options menu the points are the same 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.080
 everything is a little easier 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:47.639
 become reduced, it is simply a 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.310
 very slim operating system too 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.199
 apps have all been changed 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.789
 we still have dissatisfied sap we 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.289
 can still do good screen lockscreen 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:00.300
 So we can use a smartphone 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.919
 change whatever we want the 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.750
 Flashlight can still by the 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.919
 homebutton will be triggered on the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.419
 just lockscreen the home button 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.990
 keep pressed then activates the 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.180
 flashlight and we can take a shower 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.720
 by pressure on the button again 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.720
 break up 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.990
 to the camera app there is also one 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.690
 little something new at first 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.280
 Can we have less palpable that 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.349
 whole looks a bit like when 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.909
 iPhone is definitely Apple- oriented 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.009
 if we go to the right we get 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.190
 a live overview of the 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.569
 different filters 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.020
 and if we came to the left like that 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.180
 options menu currently it is not possible 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.219
 between simple options menu and the 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.400
 to differentiate advanced options 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.630
 that is probably yet to come and 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.090
 The camera is simply shot with 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:56.819
 a movement down and the same 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.380
 back to the gallery and off 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:02.190
 of course that is also overworked 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.539
 now all such short things so the 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.919
 different apps have been customized 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.539
 Security Center has become a bit 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.539
 the functions are all changed 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.919
 the same so if you 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:13.500
 for example, the two finger beds 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.230
 then we can move the two fingers 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.160
 our 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:22.960
 sort home screens sort like us 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:26.490
 these are used to create folders and 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.490
 copy the whole thing into the folder 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.910
 with three fingers we come automatically 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.010
 on our about no new one 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:39.130
 Add homescreens or directly to 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:41.640
 a homescreen jump so still 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.410
 once concluding the v6 is a 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:49.260
 really successful operating system is running 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:52.300
 currently only on the mp3 and mp4 but that 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.450
 absolutely wonderful without blame and it 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.100
 looks very pretty too 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.100
 that was so far from us, it's good
