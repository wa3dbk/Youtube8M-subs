you turned headlights nobody expected
will<00:00:16.139> bring<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> new<00:00:16.410> turret<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:17.640> MIDI

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
will bring a new turret a MIDI

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.529 
will bring a new turret a MIDI
controlled<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.230> let's<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> look<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
controlled so let's have a look at it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
controlled so let's have a look at it
the<00:00:21.869> RBA<00:00:22.289> thousands<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.249> turn<00:00:23.519> Sheva<00:00:23.789> on

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the RBA thousands of first turn Sheva on

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.050 
the RBA thousands of first turn Sheva on
the<00:00:23.970> market<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.929> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.369> analog<00:00:26.369> time<00:00:26.640> travel

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the market which is a analog time travel

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
the market which is a analog time travel
combined<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.750> new<00:00:28.019> technologies<00:00:28.710> MIDI

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
combined with new technologies MIDI

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.700 
combined with new technologies MIDI
control<00:00:29.669> so<00:00:30.329> down<00:00:30.719> here<00:00:30.899> we<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.199> nice<00:00:31.410> big

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
control so down here we have a nice big

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
control so down here we have a nice big
performance<00:00:32.309> section<00:00:32.519> with<00:00:33.059> eight<00:00:33.300> drum<00:00:33.570> pads

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
performance section with eight drum pads

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.619 
performance section with eight drum pads
and<00:00:34.559> different<00:00:35.280> multiple<00:00:35.699> modes<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.449> use

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
and different multiple modes you can use

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.470 
and different multiple modes you can use
them<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.589> example<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.100> cue<00:00:38.339> mode<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
them so for example in cue mode have a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.990 
them so for example in cue mode have a
cue<00:00:39.870> points<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.409> can<00:00:40.620> trigger<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.670> mapped

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
cue points I can trigger it's mapped

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.910 
cue points I can trigger it's mapped
with<00:00:42.149> scratch<00:00:42.449> life<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.379> official

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
with scratch life comes with official

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710 
with scratch life comes with official
mappings<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.489> scratch<00:00:44.670> life<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.570> all

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
mappings with scratch life so it's all

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.479 
mappings with scratch life so it's all
plug<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> play<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.829> will<00:00:47.010> also<00:00:47.159> works

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
plug and play and will also works

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.229 
plug and play and will also works
flawlessly

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
flawlessly

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.510 
flawlessly
so<00:00:49.360> now<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.570> can<00:00:49.930> do<00:00:50.079> some<00:00:50.290> cue<00:00:50.500> points<00:00:50.920> drumming

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
so now I can do some cue points drumming

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.380 
so now I can do some cue points drumming
and<00:00:52.239> Luco<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:53.079> can<00:00:53.559> set<00:00:53.800> all<00:00:54.040> salutes<00:00:54.430> Oscar<00:00:55.270> new

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
and Luco I can set all salutes Oscar new

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.590 
and Luco I can set all salutes Oscar new
slang<00:00:55.629> from<00:00:56.379> small<00:00:56.739> boobs

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
slang from small boobs

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.180 
slang from small boobs
sadly<00:00:59.600> mode<00:00:59.780> I<00:01:00.079> can<00:01:00.550> trigger<00:01:01.550> samples<00:01:03.190> just

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
sadly mode I can trigger samples just

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.399 
sadly mode I can trigger samples just
old<00:01:04.460> sample<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.239> pushed<00:01:05.750> upon<00:01:05.960> us<00:01:06.080> again<00:01:06.170> to

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
old sample and pushed upon us again to

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.190 
old sample and pushed upon us again to
stop<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.740> sample<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.450> last<00:01:08.659> bowl<00:01:08.930> I

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
stop the sample and in the last bowl I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.550 
stop the sample and in the last bowl I
have<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:10.190> drumroll<00:01:10.820> mode<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.720> cut<00:01:11.930> up<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.350> slice

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
have a drumroll mode to cut up and slice

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.490 
have a drumroll mode to cut up and slice
attracts<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:14.540> cool<00:01:14.750> thing<00:01:14.930> about<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:15.290> is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
attracts the cool thing about this is

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.070 
attracts the cool thing about this is
also<00:01:15.800> I<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.220> combine<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:17.149> is<00:01:17.300> due<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.780> mode

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
also I can combine this is due to a mode

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.870 
also I can combine this is due to a mode
so<00:01:18.649> if<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.860> hit<00:01:19.009> two<00:01:19.220> buttons

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
so if I hit two buttons

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.930 
so if I hit two buttons
I<00:01:19.909> have<00:01:20.479> splitted<00:01:20.960> up<00:01:21.049> those<00:01:21.350> drum<00:01:22.100> pads<00:01:22.340> so

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
I have splitted up those drum pads so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.730 
I have splitted up those drum pads so
now<00:01:23.060> for<00:01:23.119> example<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:23.750> have<00:01:23.869> four<00:01:24.140> cue<00:01:24.290> points

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
now for example I have four cue points

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.160 
now for example I have four cue points
and<00:01:25.009> for<00:01:25.369> loop<00:01:25.520> length<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.119> can<00:01:26.720> do<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> same

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
and for loop length I can do the same

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.609 
and for loop length I can do the same
with<00:01:27.380> QM<00:01:28.100> sample<00:01:28.670> or<00:01:29.149> looping<00:01:29.539> sample<00:01:29.960> to

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
with QM sample or looping sample to

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.889 
with QM sample or looping sample to
split<00:01:30.950> off<00:01:31.160> my<00:01:31.399> performance<00:01:32.060> pads<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.720> do

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
split off my performance pads and to do

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.499 
split off my performance pads and to do
different<00:01:33.320> modes<00:01:33.789> also<00:01:34.789> very<00:01:34.940> handy<00:01:35.210> is<00:01:35.360> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
different modes also very handy is the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.450 
different modes also very handy is the
large<00:01:35.690> attraction<00:01:36.200> called<00:01:36.380> out<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:37.130> what<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
large attraction called out but what you
