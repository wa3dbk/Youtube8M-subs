00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.740
 Podolsk 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:10.870
 it seems yeah potpan educa 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.800
 residential youth 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 girls hello not good afternoon today 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.320
 I feel the mouse on a tripod 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.100
 Today I will show a boho cardigan 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.579
 which I sewed myself is one of the models 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.120
 which I sewed with my own hands and style 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.789
 boho 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.699
 this is one of my favorite styles for you 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.309
 implies a multi-layered natural 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 cloth some clarity 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:04.390
 and a little carelessness is possible 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 moderate here and it will be about this 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 cardigan then i will show more pictures 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.050
 but for now, I'll show it to you and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.860
 a little bit about what it is made of and what 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.740
 details and so it is made of very fine 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.670
 woolen cloth here this part 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.799
 shelves and sleeves 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 this is thin thin wool on here these 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.970
 here are multilayer lower here very 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.899
 difficult but that's hard to do this here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.140
 bottom things are thin cotton 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.370
 I 'll show you here 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 wait will be longer to him I sewed 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:54.380
 a few meters of lace braid so 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.880
 further on the sleeves are made flowers which 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.940
 also knitted from fine cotton color this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.150
 the color is very beautiful brown 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.410
 light brown slightly pink 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.239
 a shade so here I picked up 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.780
 other things and accessories too 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:20.450
 pink tint it means here pantyhose 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.489
 with pink details and im since style 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 It involves layering the I 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.500
 here at the bottom of the dress top blouse where 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.330
 this blouse is also very well done 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 show what 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.290
 lush ruffles in the back are shorter in front 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.010
 there is a village borki from my very 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.989
 cardigan 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 and here it turns out so in the image that is 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.950
 this is such a romantic 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.320
 Boho style 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 because it is completely made of 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 natural fabrics are cotton and wool 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.870
 as I said, I wanted to say about 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.459
 this style boho 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.850
 so she was told to write 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.850
 scenario 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.799
 you are me while you are with them 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.799
 withdrawing while mental 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.349
 but 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.430
 I love to draw pictures spontaneously 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.730
 that is, when you take paints you take canvas 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.220
 and you absolutely do not know what will happen next 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.569
 what comes out of it that is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.060
 let go of your fantasy and that's what 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.000
 this is doing and then you yourself are surprised 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.360
 what is the result and here is the same thing 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.650
 for me clothes style and when when decided 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.140
 or just boho clothes i never 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.760
 I know what happens at the output that is 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.760
 I have some materials 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.519
 something in my head maybe some 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.519
 ideas but I don't know exactly what it will be 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.599
 and every time this is how to draw on 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.420
 clean canvas 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.000
 completely let go of yourself and here it is 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.489
 cardigan just from the same area yes 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.239
 by the way he has a little back 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:17.449
 the hood well it's just like decorative 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 the part is not functional and that's how 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:26.650
 I already said it completely spontaneous 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.650
 the thing that is made in a rush 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:38.630
 how else can you complete it 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.050
 not difficult to say and generally do not know how 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.860
 I know maybe my style is green 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.169
 black stripes on our graphs 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.169
 underline something don't know what 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:57.080
 the remaining options are two more options like 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.889
 can i wear this cardigan i will show on 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.860
 photographs 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.300
 as well as you can wear it just with 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.879
 T-shirt and jeans 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.220
 do you prefer this style i wear 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.789
 jeans rarely i like dresses more 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.970
 skirts 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.970
 so I have such options and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.319
 all the kindest and most fruitful day
