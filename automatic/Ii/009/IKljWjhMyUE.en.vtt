00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
and we are going to start covering

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.039 
and we are going to start covering
creatine<00:00:05.009> usage<00:00:05.370> specifically<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.180> want<00:00:06.509> we

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
creatine usage specifically we want we

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.010 
creatine usage specifically we want we
want<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.379> answer<00:00:07.970> should<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.180> take<00:00:09.420> creatine

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
want to answer should you take creatine

want to answer should you take creatine
before<00:00:10.230> bed<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.190> safe<00:00:11.810> so<00:00:12.810> let's<00:00:13.350> begin

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
before bed is it safe so let's begin

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.490 
before bed is it safe so let's begin
first<00:00:16.320> let's<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.920> define<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.280> creatine<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
first let's just define what creatine is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.650 
first let's just define what creatine is
creatine<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> naturally<00:00:20.610> occurring

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
creatine is a naturally occurring

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
creatine is a naturally occurring
substance<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.870> your<00:00:21.930> body<00:00:22.290> it<00:00:23.160> provides

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
substance in your body it provides

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.260 
substance in your body it provides
energy<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> muscles<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.280> molecular

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
energy to the muscles on a molecular

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.010 
energy to the muscles on a molecular
level

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
level

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.010 
level
creatine<00:00:28.800> forms<00:00:29.400> what's<00:00:29.550> called<00:00:29.850> ATP<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
creatine forms what's called ATP and

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.250 
creatine forms what's called ATP and
that<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.880> fuel<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.810> your<00:00:33.930> cells

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
that is kind of like fuel for your cells

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.970 
that is kind of like fuel for your cells
that<00:00:34.590> allows<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.840> do<00:00:36.840> vital<00:00:37.530> functions

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that allows them to do vital functions

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.940 
that allows them to do vital functions
for<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> cell<00:00:39.410> practically<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> means<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
for the cell practically it means that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
for the cell practically it means that
they<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.340> reproduce<00:00:42.410> faster<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.600> ultimately

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
they can reproduce faster and ultimately

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
they can reproduce faster and ultimately
helps<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> build<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.470> muscle<00:00:47.040> now<00:00:47.250> creatine

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
helps you build more muscle now creatine

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940 
helps you build more muscle now creatine

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
is a very old substances first

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.910 
is a very old substances first
discovered<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.809> 1832<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.680> been<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
discovered in 1832 so this has been a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.639 
discovered in 1832 so this has been a
known<00:00:53.790> substance<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> long<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.620> like

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
known substance for a long time and like

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.670 
known substance for a long time and like
we<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> said<00:00:56.880> it<00:00:57.059> does<00:00:57.270> occur<00:00:57.630> naturally<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
we are I said it does occur naturally in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.639 
we are I said it does occur naturally in
the<00:00:59.190> body<00:00:59.219> especially<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.200> skeletal

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the body especially in the skeletal

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.119 
the body especially in the skeletal
muscles<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.350> what<00:01:04.350> should<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.709> do<00:01:04.859> when

day in the middle that just as long as
you're<00:01:35.009> doing<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.369> consistently<00:01:35.869> at<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> same

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
you're doing it consistently at the same

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.230 
you're doing it consistently at the same
day<00:01:37.679> 24<00:01:38.520> hours<00:01:38.789> apart

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
day 24 hours apart

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.389 
day 24 hours apart
now<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.779> 24-hour<00:01:40.380> window<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:40.979> important

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
now the 24-hour window is very important

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.039 
now the 24-hour window is very important
because<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.759> allows<00:01:41.999> you<00:01:42.209> or<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> fully

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because it allows you or by to fully

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.769 
because it allows you or by to fully
metabolize<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:44.520> dose<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.939> creatine<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.569> took

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:45.779 
metabolize the dose of creatine you took

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:49.429 
metabolize the dose of creatine you took
the<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.229> day<00:01:46.469> so<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.639> way<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.029> people<00:01:48.439> set

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the first day so one way that people set

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
the first day so one way that people set
up<00:01:49.469> a<00:01:49.709> reminder<00:01:50.249> is<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.969> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
up a reminder is that they take it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
up a reminder is that they take it
before<00:01:51.419> bed<00:01:51.569> which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> totally<00:01:52.649> natural

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
before bed which is a totally natural

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.469 
before bed which is a totally natural
thing<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.429> do<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.789> before<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.179> go<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.389> bed

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
thing to do right before you go to bed

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.260 
thing to do right before you go to bed
just<00:01:54.869> take<00:01:55.529> your<00:01:55.740> creatine<00:01:56.069> make<00:01:57.029> sure<00:01:57.179> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
just take your creatine make sure you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.849 
just take your creatine make sure you
drink<00:01:57.419> plenty<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.959> water<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:58.560> taking
