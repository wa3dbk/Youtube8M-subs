 mestalla 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.970
 first clear occasion of the game will arrive for the red set to point 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.829
 to mark aranda against 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.289
 the malagueño planted alone in front of Caesar but he did not know how to solve before the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.409

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 great intervention by Ricardo 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.100
 valencia if going ahead before the break but the score is going to be canceled 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 by clear out of play delay to give the ball to go to villa 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.320

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.240
 in the center of the penalty area from the left wing

 joaquin goal 1 to 0 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.530
 the punch of the valence was again much more effective than his game 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 osasuna did not give the game for lost header from pandiani that goes out 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.479
