let's<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.260> started

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
let's get started

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
let's get started
alrighty<00:00:56.579> guys<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.390> thing<00:00:57.539> you're

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
alrighty guys so the first thing you're

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.410 
alrighty guys so the first thing you're
going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.289> take<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.800> rolls<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
going to do is take your rolls and just

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
going to do is take your rolls and just
fold<00:01:00.719> them<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.440> down<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> sides

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
fold them all the way down the sides

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.210 
fold them all the way down the sides
like<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> once<00:01:03.870> you're<00:01:04.080> done<00:01:04.220> pressing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
like this so once you're done pressing

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.590 
like this so once you're done pressing
down<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> sides<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> shape<00:01:06.420> like

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
down the sides you'll get a shape like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
down the sides you'll get a shape like
this<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.220> just<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.340> ahead<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> cut<00:01:09.150> these

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this and just go ahead and cut these

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
this and just go ahead and cut these
into<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.780> half-inch<00:01:10.500> pieces

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.430 

so<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> thought<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> base<00:01:16.410> for

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
so this is thought to be the base for

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440 
so this is thought to be the base for
your<00:01:16.980> entire<00:01:17.250> wall<00:01:17.550> art<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
your entire wall art it's just going to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.920 
your entire wall art it's just going to
be<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> five<00:01:19.080> piece<00:01:19.560> flower<00:01:20.010> like<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:21.510> yeah

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
be a five piece flower like this so yeah

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.000 
be a five piece flower like this so yeah
once<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> lay<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.340> onto<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:24.740> table<00:01:25.740> or

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
once you lay this out onto your table or

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.680 
once you lay this out onto your table or
whatever<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.940> you're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.600> ahead

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
whatever then you're going to go ahead

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.270 
whatever then you're going to go ahead
and<00:01:27.900> heat<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.410> glue<00:01:28.470> gun<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.130> whatever

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and heat up your glue gun or whatever

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
and heat up your glue gun or whatever
other<00:01:29.580> Swan<00:01:30.090> glue<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.990> definitely

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
other Swan glue I would definitely

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.110 
other Swan glue I would definitely
recommend<00:01:31.440> is<00:01:31.920> strong<00:01:32.190> glue<00:01:32.370> that's<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.940> sure

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
recommend is strong glue that's for sure

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.030 
recommend is strong glue that's for sure
and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.260> ahead<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> take<00:01:34.710> little

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and then just go ahead and take little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.450 
and then just go ahead and take little
parts<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> start<00:01:35.970> gluing<00:01:36.210> them<00:01:36.480> together

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.710 

afterwards<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.360> ahead<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
afterwards you're going to go ahead and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.720 
afterwards you're going to go ahead and
take<00:01:42.870> all<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.410> other<00:01:43.590> pieces<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
take all of the other pieces as well and

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.240 
take all of the other pieces as well and
go<00:01:45.360> ahead<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.690> add<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.200> between<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
go ahead and add them in between the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
go ahead and add them in between the
base<00:01:47.640> flowers<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.600> mean<00:01:48.930> face<00:01:49.260> puddles<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:49.950> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
base flowers I mean face puddles if that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.830 
base flowers I mean face puddles if that
makes<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.520> you'll<00:01:50.760> see<00:01:50.910> all<00:01:51.060> right<00:01:51.330> now<00:01:53.840> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
makes some you'll see all right now and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
makes some you'll see all right now and
I<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:56.130> looks<00:01:56.400> really<00:01:56.670> easy

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I will say that this looks really easy

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.440 
I will say that this looks really easy
but<00:01:57.270> once<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.900> wall<00:01:58.560> art<00:01:58.770> starts<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.400> grow<00:01:59.760> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
but once your wall art starts to grow it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
but once your wall art starts to grow it
gets<00:02:00.720> kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.990> confusing<00:02:01.200> after<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> while<00:02:02.310> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
gets kind of confusing after a while so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
gets kind of confusing after a while so
I<00:02:02.670> would<00:02:03.030> recommend<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.690> pay<00:02:03.960> attention

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I would recommend that you pay attention

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
I would recommend that you pay attention
to<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:05.460> how<00:02:05.640> much<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:05.910> putting<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> each

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to like how much you're putting on each

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
to like how much you're putting on each
side<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.230> one<00:02:07.470> side<00:02:08.070> doesn't<00:02:08.280> end<00:02:08.460> up

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
side so that one side doesn't end up

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240 
side so that one side doesn't end up
getting<00:02:08.940> whop<00:02:09.179> sided<00:02:09.690> looking<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.530> yeah<00:02:10.950> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
getting whop sided looking so yeah just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
getting whop sided looking so yeah just
pay<00:02:11.400> attention<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.930> distribute<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.990> equally

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
pay attention to distribute it equally

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
pay attention to distribute it equally
