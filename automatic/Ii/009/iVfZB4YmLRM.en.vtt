left side switch back to the right side

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.410 
left side switch back to the right side
and<00:02:03.680> continue

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.790 

not<00:02:11.420> only<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.900> great<00:02:12.170> way<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.410> increase

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
not only is this a great way to increase

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.619 
not only is this a great way to increase
the<00:02:12.920> number<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.220> muscle<00:02:13.670> fibers<00:02:14.030> involved<00:02:14.510> in

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
the number of muscle fibers involved in

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.930 
the number of muscle fibers involved in
the<00:02:14.750> exercise<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.620> therefore<00:02:16.160> muscle<00:02:16.580> growth

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the exercise and therefore muscle growth

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240 
the exercise and therefore muscle growth
but<00:02:17.780> as<00:02:17.930> I've<00:02:18.110> told<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.500> before<00:02:18.560> you're

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
but as I've told you before you're

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.369 
but as I've told you before you're
actually<00:02:19.730> stronger<00:02:20.390> when<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.810> do<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.230> arm

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
actually stronger when you do one arm

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.339 
actually stronger when you do one arm
exercises<00:02:22.010> as<00:02:22.459> compared<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.360> exercises<00:02:24.200> that

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
exercises as compared to exercises that

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.680 
exercises as compared to exercises that
you<00:02:24.470> perform<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.580> both<00:02:25.849> arms<00:02:26.239> at<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> same

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you perform with both arms at the same

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.229 
you perform with both arms at the same
time<00:02:27.049> since<00:02:28.040> you'll<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.220> able<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.790> use<00:02:28.970> more

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
time since you'll be able to use more

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.360 
time since you'll be able to use more
weight<00:02:29.569> on<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:30.110> arm<00:02:30.290> pull<00:02:30.530> down<00:02:30.769> you'll

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
weight on the one arm pull down you'll

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.220 
weight on the one arm pull down you'll
be<00:02:31.519> able<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.760> place<00:02:31.970> more<00:02:32.330> overload<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
be able to place more overload on the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.130 
be able to place more overload on the
lats<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.910> therefore<00:02:34.910> induce<00:02:35.330> more<00:02:35.690> muscle

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
lats and therefore induce more muscle

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.190 
lats and therefore induce more muscle
growth<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.739> strength<00:02:37.610> gains<00:02:37.940> another<00:02:38.900> good

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
growth and strength gains another good

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
growth and strength gains another good
thing<00:02:39.230> about<00:02:39.560> doing<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.040> arm<00:02:40.220> pull<00:02:40.459> downs<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
thing about doing one arm pull downs is

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.089 
thing about doing one arm pull downs is
that<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.840> use<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.319> increase<00:02:42.829> your

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
that you can use it to increase your

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.270 
that you can use it to increase your
training<00:02:43.549> intensity<00:02:44.110> by<00:02:45.110> moving<00:02:45.440> from<00:02:45.769> one<00:02:46.099> on

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
training intensity by moving from one on

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.539 
training intensity by moving from one on
to<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.640> next<00:02:47.150> without<00:02:47.810> any<00:02:48.200> rest<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:49.220> three

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
to the next without any rest do three

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.910 
to the next without any rest do three
sets<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.090> manner<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:51.170> from<00:02:51.410> right<00:02:51.650> arm

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
sets in this manner going from right arm

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.880 
sets in this manner going from right arm
to<00:02:52.130> left<00:02:52.370> arm<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.910> right<00:02:53.180> arm<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.660> left<00:02:53.900> arm<00:02:54.200> to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
to left arm to right arm to left arm to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.960 
to left arm to right arm to left arm to
right<00:02:55.160> on<00:02:55.370> back<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:56.120> left<00:02:57.129> all<00:02:58.129> without<00:02:58.610> rest

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
right on back to left all without rest

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.050 
right on back to left all without rest
that<00:02:59.870> will<00:03:00.019> help<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.319> gain<00:03:00.500> size<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.340> burn

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
that will help you gain size and burn

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.930 
that will help you gain size and burn
off<00:03:02.239> body<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.980> fact<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.400> do<00:03:04.519> an<00:03:04.610> entire

off body in fact you can do an entire

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.360 
off body in fact you can do an entire
one<00:03:05.239> arm<00:03:05.450> back<00:03:05.660> workout<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.980> will<00:03:07.099> save

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
one arm back workout and it will save

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.430
