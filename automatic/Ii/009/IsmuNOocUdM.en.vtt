00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.840
 woman 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.620
 now now 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.699
 and how much this technique has arisen but 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.909
 for resuscitation cartoons while 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.140
 draw can't handle from beginning to shoot on 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.550
 film actors playing characters 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.289
 then shot are projected into 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 special pumping device and animators 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.050
 frame by frame the whole movie 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.369
 thus moving the plot 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.629
 becomes realistic but themselves 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.040
 they look like comic book characters this 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.470
 technique in 1914 invented the american 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.870
 artist animator max on the grid posture in 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510
 early thirties oils and fats 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.850
 used this technique in 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.600
 cartoons right keyboard not 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.290
 full length travel 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.710
 Gulliver is a large Ashkenazic family 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.100
 swims well but max is already in 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 the school began to work on stage 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 after classes he stayed in class and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260
 redrawn without textbooks on paper 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.940
 cards 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.100
 it worked him out so clearly and clearly that 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.720
 school officials with pleasure 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.830
 bought them 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.970
 I have a clear and smooth draw 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.780
 contours are very useful mass in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.650
 work on cartoons when 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.100
 max started experimenting with 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 Saratovsky MSK his work 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 got interested back in rubles he 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.920
 was a clone in a dark suit i 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.020
 played a few conical prices 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 white background when the film was shown and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190
 charged the euro since Moscow 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.920
 contour outlined like order frames 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.220
 so the first character appeared harmful 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.800
 regiment clubs that live inkpots and 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.270
 each series got out of it to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.220
 to cheat the law appeared bookterek book 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.550
 silly singer of free morals she 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 successfully competed 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.280
 note als ars 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.150
 the request was copied from the real character 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.979
 twice first with the help of technology 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.980
 Saratov copy and in the second she had a clear 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.799
 prototype nice but stupid and 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.530
 tasteless american klitschko 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.020
 kelin key 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.640
 she even sued the court heard but 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399
 only made a mockery of themselves 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.780
 you did a great PR being an ebook 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869

 hastily competed with the wolf do not know 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.219
 however authorities condemned and proud 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.290
 own projects 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.609
 over time, the animation did not stand still and 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.900
 many studios began to draw movements 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.760
 characters 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.010
 without old gables in the fifties 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.659
 This product is available for wide 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.930
 applications for in Soviet animation 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.590
 true reception itself was called 5 years with 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.280
 such a brand was projection

 other times today the scopin applies 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.769
 turbidity 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.790
 most often this technique is needed to create 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.349
 the world of hallucinations and the substitution of actors 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.620
