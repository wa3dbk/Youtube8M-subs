00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello friends my name is Michael 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.200
 Georgian I am the chief editor of the magazine 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.150
 both audio stereo &amp; video 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 and in this video I will try to tell and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
 clearly show you the differences 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.150
 headphones what is the difference between 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 fashionable professional and 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.050
 audiophile models and which ones 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 it is better 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.080
 necessary foreword let's start with 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 that all headphones are arranged approximately 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.109
 identical one way or another reproduces 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.149
 frequency range which 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 perceived by the human ear to 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.719
 sorry to judge the sound quality by 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.780
 this parameter we can not because 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.790
 it is influenced by many more factors 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 how are the designed headphones from which 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.539
 material made a diffuser on which 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.969
 what principle does it work 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 the wires are used and finally how 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 just tuned the sound 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 headset engineer 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.949
 this is the secret of different things 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 sound of different models and now 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.010
 try to look listen to everything 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.110
 it sounds and looks like this is typical 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.700
 Fashionable headphones they are not designed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.340
 only engineers but also marketers 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.409
 so on the skull logo i 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
 faux leather trim gone 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 much more money effort than 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 own sound for what ordinary 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.890
 headphones are created so what do we hear 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 about the first marketers believe that in 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 music main bases and there is a bass 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 still heard drums well and the rest is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.880
 everything else is not important to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.039
 u halo 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 that's exactly what it seems 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.159
 musical picture to happy 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 to the owner 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 Fashionable headphones here are standard 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.179
 iphone headphones don't be surprised even 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.720
 they are better than fashion 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.640
 ears they are not holding well but it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.799
 rather my problems and apple engineers 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.429
 pulled out of these plugs maximum 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.530
 the possible 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.670
 they really reproduce well 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.350
 mid frequency range 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 the most important range for perception 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.019
 music so they are well tasty 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.370
 guitar vocals 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 this heart gets more adequate 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.420
 scale though of course 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.549
 and hold out to natural by virtue 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.349
 just the physical features of the drivers 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.720
 they are too small but somehow 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.700
 it is quite possible to listen and main 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.739
 the meaning of the composition will be brought to you 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.510
 but in the world there are better headphones 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.030
 here it is full-sized headphones ben 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.829
 windows he is a danish firm with a 50 year old 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.590
 experience in the production of audio equipment 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:42.000
 what is their merit is full 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.330
 sound i mean you hear fuck 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 and expressive middle and upper 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.590
 frequencies are transparent and the most important thing in these 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.160
 Headphones appear new details 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.810
 in finally noticed that searches for Keyboards 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.760
 play in principle at this stage you can 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.010
 stop any normal music lover 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.510
 but surely it is far from 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.040
 the last step towards excellence here 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.620
 not just good but 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 audiophile headphones this model firm 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.239
 Senheiser is popular not 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.260
 only music lovers but also professionals 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.420
 sound engineer because it allows 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.090
 hear all the smallest details in 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.440
 phonogram while recording or mixing 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.140
 the sound here is of course a musical picture 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.200
 as detailed as possible and not only 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.540
 all parties are musicians but also on what 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.840
 instruments they play what effects 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.030
 were used in general here is everything 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.079
 what professionals need for work 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.280
 and music lover for enjoyment but also this 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.430
 not the end here for those modest looking 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.410
 Headphones of a young ambitious company abc 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 you will have to lay out 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.519
 a fair amount of money but they promise 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.680
 incredible feeling is not easy 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.720
 quality sound reproduction and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.049
 a high-end reproduction 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.609
 that is gourmet so to speak 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.950
 The main thing in these headphones is that they are 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.260
 could planar they are dynamic like 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.150
 most other models are fundamentally 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.950
 another driver design allows 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.430
 get a fundamentally different quality 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:26.830
 sound, he is not just one more, and 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.620
 especially beautiful 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.720
 all the details are in full view and here you are 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.099
 understand that the musicians do not just play 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.810
 in some concert hall 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.969
 specifically in the royal albert hall for example 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.020
 well and in the third 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:43.289
 realistic musical picture 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.120
 it becomes literally frightening 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.240
 I once caught myself listening to that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.430
 headphones that thought like a piano 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.460
 played somewhere in the room they are in them and 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.710
 really a little scared 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.060
 but precisely for such sensations is created 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.400
 high-end equipment 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.080
 Of course to fully listen to such 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.419
 headphones you'll need phonograms 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.240
 Only the highest quality yet 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.669
 full headphone amplifier 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.210
 which are also pretty worth it worth it 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.900
 Togo 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.669
 you decide the most important thing do not commit 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.330
 thoughtless purchases do not get carried away 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.949
 excessive beautiful logos and 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.659
 choose your headphones wisely hope our 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.659
 modest educational program to you a little bit
