00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.019
 It's worth a trillion volume with all the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.000
 confidence is always pending that if 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.000
 I need something I wanted 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 therefore banking an analyze 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:29.920
 starting a complicated team that the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.290
 team always 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.390
 where she could get the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.800
 we saved 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.500
 for one because that estimates 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.080
 with the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.080
 in a league so complicated difficult that 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.030
 I know it's not going to be an easy one because 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.020
 when one begins that color attends 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.990
 the diversity 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.250
 to give good happy but calm 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.640
 always with your feet on the ground 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.040
 well working as a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.890
 and the palate of the historic scorer of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 the aspects of panama with 34 goals like that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 who will travel with him 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 good afternoon for now a good 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.899
 way to decide and define the roof 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.399
 short space before expiration 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.049
 property of artist that have been 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.569
 many Panamanians is average basic that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.159
 normally sold if we go very 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.140
 back I think it was 20 to 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.149
 roadrunner did it pretty well maybe 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.619
 we go pÃ©rez of customs work when 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.569
 there is a guarantee for years he was 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.490
 mexican I get paid some generations 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.409
 footballers who looks like a joke but such and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.090
 How is the thing in a box? 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.829
 being not only comes to you while being 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.270
 final but that there are the 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.250
 four tickets and I have here background and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.890
 very good performance was the Panamanians 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.780
 that have come to Mexican soccer and this 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.909
 of magnificent roof tile debut caster de 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.530
 acts and I said it to see what happens with 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.849
 toluca and in the final phase because it's going to 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.709
 being in the group will be a team 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.030
 that you look at harvesting and the 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.119
 first sites 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.069
 I do not know if he will keep that first place but 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.560
 Maybe you need some leap from 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.030
 quality in your game to make a serious 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 contender against teams 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 has stopped attending and maybe it's the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.270
 element that can give them that offensive 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.430
 I do not know how it can enrich the team 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.140
 of enrique meza player with those 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.670
 features will have to adapt to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.459
 than give it two or three weeks so that in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.590
 the physical line is full but 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.870
 and to define in that way is not coincidental that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.989
 in your presentation in such a match 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.989
 closed 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.879
 too 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.129
 the value you have and solve it like this 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.659
 speaks of a player used to 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.310
 move in the goal area you said that 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.290
 everything that has been absent and has 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.260
 searched everywhere for the last 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.260
 time campaign the first and only 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:01.710
 in its third stage from the front 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.350
 that gave the chance to shoot at 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.280
 door barely a minimum space and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.280
 take advantage immediately 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.620
 two or three games just much to overcome 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.090
 in moments with his vision his four 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.520
 predecessors their mistakes on a computer that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.110
 days is diametrically different than 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.110
 I was exhibiting all
