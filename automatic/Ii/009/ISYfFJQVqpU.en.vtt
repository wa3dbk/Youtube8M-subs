00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 how to mount portal pillars 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.650
 level of difficulty two hammers high 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 on solid foundations the pillars 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.990
 have to support the weight of the gate and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 the efforts of the possible motorization 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.680
 the assembly of hollow elements 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.680
 prefabricated offers an easy solution to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.140
 implement and within the reach of all 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.080
 you will need planchas cabinet from 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 ankle is of string of frames 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.399
 metal sand cement 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 mortar gravel wire glues 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:47.190
 of elements for pillars of gates two 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 pillar hats equip yourself with a meter 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 a spirit level of a plumb line 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.219
 of an angle grinder of a shovel of a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.370
 wheelbarrow of a cement mixer with a seal 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.920
 of a mason rule of a trough and a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.110
 trowel 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 equip yourself with safety glasses 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.600
 protective gloves and ear cups 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.330
 noise canceling on the floor 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 the implantation of the pillars by adding 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.450
 one of the edges of 5 cm and between the two 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.049
 boundaries and a trench of 20 cm 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.299
 wide for the threshold dug to 40 cm 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.189
 minimum depth or following the off 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.799
 freezing of each region at the level of 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 pillars and sill realize a formwork 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.320
 on the top and what is the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.030
 well level line the bottom of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 excavations of a stone hedgehog to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 the location of each pillar plant 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.509
 a metal frame with four irons 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.780
 who will have to go beyond the foundation 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.390
 about 60 cm placed then the frame 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.880
 horizontal of the threshold inserted there in 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.009
 the vertical structures then ligate 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.719
 there with wire 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.060
 the horizontal shooting frame must 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.640
 be slightly elevated from the hedgehog of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 pebbles at the mature arts center does 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.820
 pass the electrical conduits 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.819
 necessary for your future equipment 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.760
 such as doorbell lighting motorization 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.160
 of gates fill the formwork of 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.170
 concrete and night 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.360
 the rule by dragging into a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.940
 lateral movement back and forth on the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 edges of the formwork was waiting 48 hours 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.660
 for cabinets control flatness 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.890
 and the level of your foundation 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.560
 position the first element of each 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.960
 pillar and check their alignment with 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.720
 to be regulated failing to adjust large enough 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.400
 take a straight cleat measure 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 their spacing to accommodate your 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.170
 portal and trace their outlines on the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.240
 concrete if the support is not 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.420
 perfectly flat and two levels done 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.850
 an insole of 2 to 3 cm of mortar on 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.800
 the surface of the plots the first element 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.680
 of each pillar is a success at 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.840
 mortar for outdoor this will help 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 compensate for a flatness problem or 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 two levels 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.170
 check the position of the block 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 with the bubble level then set the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.520
 second element by controlling high 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.850
 bubble level but also with the wire to 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.520
 lead 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.310
 it is not necessary to put putty 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.660
 on pillar blocks with interlocking thought 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.060
 to pull out the electrical ducts 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.250
 for the future motorization of the portal 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.350
 profited that make them pass again 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.590
 enough to install on each 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.170
 pillar the extension of the frame 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.330
 cut to pillar measurements 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.820
 tie with wire and then engage 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.540
 and pose the third element as the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.519
 previous 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.739
 upholster the interior walls of a 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.579
 bill movie dating to avoid a 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.620
 subsequent cracking it is better 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.689
 to dig the sealing points of the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.959
 possible bottom hinges that you 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.430
 reserve with polystyrene 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.319
 favor chemical sealing for 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.180
 duo hinges also think about doing 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.989
 take out the electrical ducts 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.989
 motorization 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.360
 prepare concrete to fill 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.360
 first two pillars elements 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.390
 pour gently to garnish 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.390
 gradually 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.440
 and enough from time to time with an iron to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.940
 concrete to chase any pockets 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.490
 air 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.310
 then continue laying the three 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.710
 following elements it is better to 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.290
 progress in steps without 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.700
 forget the dilation film and the 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.190
 possible outlets of sheaths 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.250
 electric the final height of your 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.689
 potos should exceed about 10 to 20 cm 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.819
 from the portal 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.089
 the last element of filled portals 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:46.239
 of concrete even out the surface but without 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:48.379
 high school then let it harden 

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:50.839
 garnish the top of the pillar 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.509
 mortars glues and present the hat 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.039
 over center and carefully before 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.680
 to press on to perfect 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.900
 adhesion 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.150
 the next week your new pillars 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.050
 will be ready to receive the portal and its 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.990
 motorization 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:11.789
