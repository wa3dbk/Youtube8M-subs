you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.119> tell<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.810> easier<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.290> person<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you can tell and is easier in person to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
you can tell and is easier in person to
to<00:02:08.160> tell<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> difference<00:02:08.789> between<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.330> blue

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to tell the difference between the blue

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.750 
to tell the difference between the blue
and<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> black<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.259> they're<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> solid

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and the black and they're the solid

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750 
and the black and they're the solid
colors

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.520 

so<00:02:15.760> then<00:02:15.970> there's<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> chinchilla<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.960> here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
and the opal on the right so they have

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.330 
and the opal on the right so they have
the<00:03:20.140> same<00:03:20.320> similar<00:03:20.860> patterns<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:22.630> their<00:03:22.900> fur

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the same similar patterns to their fur

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.790 
the same similar patterns to their fur
but<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.970> chestnut<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.080> much<00:03:26.290> more<00:03:26.500> black

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
but the chestnut is much more black

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.270 
but the chestnut is much more black
looking<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:28.480> opal<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.110> much<00:03:29.380> more<00:03:29.620> blue

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
looking and the opal is much more blue

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.020 
looking and the opal is much more blue
looking<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:35.110> if<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.500> tell<00:03:35.770> there<00:03:36.100> that's

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
looking so if you can tell there that's

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.110 
looking so if you can tell there that's
a<00:03:37.209> good<00:03:37.360> shot<00:03:37.600> right<00:03:37.630> there<00:03:37.989> perfect

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
a good shot right there perfect

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.449 
a good shot right there perfect
yeah<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.390> think<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.930> five<00:03:41.110> colors<00:03:41.440> if<00:03:42.160> I

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
yeah so I think we have five colors if I

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.600 
yeah so I think we have five colors if I
know<00:03:42.850> how<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.030> count<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.860> nine<00:03:44.860> kits<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:45.550> two
