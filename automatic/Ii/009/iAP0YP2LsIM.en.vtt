00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
I'm almost dying out and what that does

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.789 
I'm almost dying out and what that does
is<00:01:27.040> it<00:01:27.460> makes<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:28.450> game<00:01:28.840> think<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.439> he's<00:01:29.619> on

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
is it makes the game think that he's on

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.859 
is it makes the game think that he's on
the<00:01:29.920> railing<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.759> it<00:01:31.030> gives<00:01:31.180> him<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.540> white

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
the railing so it gives him that white

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.200 
the railing so it gives him that white
fuzz<00:01:32.320> but<00:01:32.770> uh<00:01:32.800> when<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.400> zombie<00:01:33.729> kills<00:01:34.000> them

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
fuzz but uh when the zombie kills them

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.710 
fuzz but uh when the zombie kills them
it<00:01:34.720> pushes<00:01:35.140> him<00:01:35.260> off<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.560> railing<00:01:35.800> but<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
it pushes him off the railing but if you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.780 
it pushes him off the railing but if you
died<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:37.960> midair<00:01:38.409> or<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.220> can<00:01:39.340> also<00:01:39.550> hit<00:01:39.729> the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
died in midair or you can also hit the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.810 
died in midair or you can also hit the
ground<00:01:40.060> doesn't<00:01:40.420> really<00:01:40.630> matter<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.640> see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
ground doesn't really matter as you see

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.399 
ground doesn't really matter as you see
the<00:01:42.970> zombies<00:01:43.180> coming<00:01:43.600> up<00:01:43.750> right<00:01:43.930> behind<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
the zombies coming up right behind it

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.950 
the zombies coming up right behind it
but<00:01:44.500> once<00:01:44.740> he<00:01:44.860> kills<00:01:45.159> them<00:01:45.340> he's<00:01:46.210> gonna<00:01:46.450> get<00:01:46.659> a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
but once he kills them he's gonna get a

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.990 
but once he kills them he's gonna get a
missed<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.950> pops<00:01:48.190> around<00:01:48.580> him<00:01:48.729> when<00:01:48.909> he

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
missed that pops around him when he

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.219 
missed that pops around him when he
spawns<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:51.040> believe<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.850> can<00:01:51.970> only

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
spawns back and I believe this can only

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.840 
spawns back and I believe this can only
you<00:01:53.229> can<00:01:53.320> only<00:01:53.470> do<00:01:53.620> this<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:54.040> person<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
you can only do this for one person so

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.200 
you can only do this for one person so
uh<00:01:54.880> yeah<00:01:55.750> as<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.380> saw<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.060> got

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
uh yeah as you just saw he just got

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.570 
uh yeah as you just saw he just got
killed<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.170> railing<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.220> once<00:02:00.460> you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
killed on that railing and once you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.000 
killed on that railing and once you
spawn<00:02:00.820> back<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.360> grief<00:02:01.600> because<00:02:01.869> uh<00:02:02.080> people

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
spawn back and grief because uh people

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.880 
spawn back and grief because uh people
from<00:02:03.250> both<00:02:03.400> teams<00:02:03.700> well<00:02:04.570> they<00:02:05.260> both<00:02:05.409> died<00:02:05.650> will
