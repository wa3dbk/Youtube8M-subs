whatever<00:03:01.290> shine<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:03.030> how<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
whatever shine to it that's just how the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.210 
whatever shine to it that's just how the
previous<00:03:03.510> owner<00:03:03.959> had<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.739> reason<00:03:04.920> we

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
previous owner had it the reason we

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.160 
previous owner had it the reason we
don't<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:06.030> water<00:03:06.269> on<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> engine<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
don't like to get water on the engine is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.660 
don't like to get water on the engine is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
because if you get water on the spark

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
because if you get water on the spark
plugs<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.299> trigger<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.840> check<00:03:10.049> engine

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
