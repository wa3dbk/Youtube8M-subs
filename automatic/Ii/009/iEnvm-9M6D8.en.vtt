00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.370
 it's a variation of the Ouija game 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.200
 but much more creepy in that 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.990
 you do not have to put your fingers 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.119
 about nothing because in this case the object 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.119
 in question it will move blue 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.140

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.140

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 the logo that he asked for seven 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 weeks the day he started working here 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.159
 I asked him for a fucking logo and he did not tell me 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.220

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 Well, the goal is never if nothing 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.490
 makes a super child person who 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.380

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.140
