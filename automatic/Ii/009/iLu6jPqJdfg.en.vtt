saying it's it's pretty cool and it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
saying it's it's pretty cool and it
looks<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.100> doesn't<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.809> what<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
looks like he doesn't have what do you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.340 
looks like he doesn't have what do you
call<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> app<00:00:54.980> on<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.129> articulation

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
call it app on your articulation

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
call it app on your articulation
articulation<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> pictures<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.399> could

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
articulation from the pictures it could

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
articulation from the pictures it could
be<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> prototype<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:01.050> whatever

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
be because it's a prototype or whatever

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
be because it's a prototype or whatever
it<00:01:01.859> might<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.280> new<00:01:03.090> bot<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.780> sure<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it might be a new bot I'm sure it's a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.450 
it might be a new bot I'm sure it's a
new<00:01:04.290> body<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.799> whatever<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.309> um<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
new body or whatever but um but that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
new body or whatever but um but that
would<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> sucking<00:01:09.270> away<00:01:10.040> if<00:01:11.040> he

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
would be kind of sucking away if he

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.679 
would be kind of sucking away if he
doesn't<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> particular<00:01:12.420> agent

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
doesn't have the a particular agent

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399 
doesn't have the a particular agent
because<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.670> used<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:16.229> was

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because you know I used to use it it was

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.859 
because you know I used to use it it was
a<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.770> bit<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> used<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> use<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> either

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a little bit but I used to use it either

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
a little bit but I used to use it either
way<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.439> good<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
way and it's good to have you know that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
way and it's good to have you know that
articulation<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.210> whatnot

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
articulation or whatnot

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
articulation or whatnot
so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.570> honest<00:01:24.990> most<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so it's but but to be honest most of the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.789 
so it's but but to be honest most of the
what<00:01:27.390> he<00:01:27.450> called<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.290> post<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
what he called it the the post is that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.969 
what he called it the the post is that
I've<00:01:29.040> seen<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> predators<00:01:30.799> have<00:01:31.799> been

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I've seen a lot of predators have been

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.640 
I've seen a lot of predators have been
pretty<00:01:32.360> apt<00:01:33.360> less<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.590> I'm

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pretty apt less if you know what I'm

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.999 
pretty apt less if you know what I'm
saying

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
saying

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
saying
they<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:35.850> use<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> Yap

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
they really don't use the Yap

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
they really don't use the Yap
articulation<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:39.680> guess<00:01:40.680> you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
articulation that much so I guess you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
articulation that much so I guess you
know<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> really<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.729> probably<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.119> gonna

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
know I really it's probably not gonna

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.580 
know I really it's probably not gonna
really<00:01:42.450> change<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.170> sure<00:01:43.200> people

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
really change that much I'm sure people

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
really change that much I'm sure people
of<00:01:43.680> bitching<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> either<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:45.110> but<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of bitching about it either way but it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
of bitching about it either way but it
looks<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.890> looks<00:01:46.950> pretty<00:01:47.670> much<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.210> in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
looks it looks pretty much like it's in

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450 
looks it looks pretty much like it's in
the<00:01:48.420> movie<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.689> mean<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.979> get

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the movie I mean what we can really get

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
the movie I mean what we can really get
from<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> movie<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
from the movie because it's really you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.170 
from the movie because it's really you
know<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.700> all

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
know how the it's all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050 
know how the it's all
what<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.229> there's<00:01:55.500> filters<00:01:56.060> looking

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what about there's filters looking

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
what about there's filters looking
