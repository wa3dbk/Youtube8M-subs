tutorials on acre nuts and and ties and
stuff<00:01:41.700> they're<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.990> video<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stuff they're all in that video and it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
stuff they're all in that video and it
talks<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.450> about<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> theory

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
talks it a little bit about the theory

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
talks it a little bit about the theory
that<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.100> head<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.840> way

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that I use for this head and so the way

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.880 
that I use for this head and so the way
I<00:01:49.020> quote<00:01:49.530> cheat<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.810> channel<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> defensive

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I quote cheat a channel on a defensive

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
I quote cheat a channel on a defensive
head<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> talk<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.049> video

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
head is what I talk about in that video

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.670 
head is what I talk about in that video
is<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:56.540> there's<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> spectrum<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
is how there's kind of a spectrum of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
is how there's kind of a spectrum of
where<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.700> pull<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> mesh<00:02:00.299> holes<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
where you pull the mesh holes on the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
where you pull the mesh holes on the
head<00:02:01.290> based<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:02.610> using<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
head based on what not you're using and

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.959 
head based on what not you're using and
so<00:02:03.829> keeping<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> mesh<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.640> innermost

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
so keeping the mesh to the innermost

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
so keeping the mesh to the innermost
side<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> head<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.710> using<00:02:08.220> an

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
side of the head would be using an

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.369 
side of the head would be using an
anchor<00:02:08.459> knot<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.479> goes<00:02:09.629> Angkor<00:02:10.050> knot<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
anchor knot so it goes Angkor knot and

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.740 
anchor knot so it goes Angkor knot and
then<00:02:10.950> interlock<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.390> bit<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.690> on

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
then interlock is a little bit more on

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.770 
then interlock is a little bit more on
the<00:02:12.840> inside<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> head

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the inside of the head

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.580 
the inside of the head
yes<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.470> mean<00:02:14.620> excuse<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.690> pulling<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
yes I mean excuse I is on is pulling it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.350 
yes I mean excuse I is on is pulling it
slightly<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.340> outside<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.940> head<00:02:19.150> and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
slightly to the outside of the head and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.870 
slightly to the outside of the head and
then<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.810> knotted<00:02:20.230> si<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:21.280> yanking<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
then a knotted si is really yanking it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880 
then a knotted si is really yanking it
out<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> outside<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.110> head<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.530> if<00:02:23.800> you

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
out to the outside of the head so if you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.080 
out to the outside of the head so if you
notice<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.310> these<00:02:25.860> anchor<00:02:26.860> knots<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.820> mesh

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
notice with these anchor knots the mesh

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.650 
notice with these anchor knots the mesh
is<00:02:28.330> all<00:02:28.810> pulled<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> inside<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.450> head

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
is all pulled to the inside of the head

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.630 
is all pulled to the inside of the head
and<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> one<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.020> rides<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.740> top

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.270 

but<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:40.110> tend<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.190> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
but I tend to like that more just to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.949 
but I tend to like that more just to
produce<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.700> little<00:02:42.940> bit<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.360> hold<00:02:45.959> compared

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
produce a little bit more hold compared

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.110 
produce a little bit more hold compared
to<00:02:47.110> just<00:02:47.320> doing<00:02:47.680> straight<00:02:47.980> anchor<00:02:48.670> knots<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
to just doing straight anchor knots the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.680 
to just doing straight anchor knots the
whole<00:02:49.300> way<00:02:49.480> but<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.220> think<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:52.000> mistake<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.540> a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
whole way but I think a mistake that a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.850 
whole way but I think a mistake that a
lot<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.930> people<00:02:53.200> make<00:02:53.380> when<00:02:53.739> they're

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
lot of people make when they're

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.500 
lot of people make when they're
stringing<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.250> defensive<00:02:54.700> head<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:55.000> throwing

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
stringing a defensive head is throwing

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.740 
stringing a defensive head is throwing
in<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.750> knot<00:02:55.959> like<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.440> stacked<00:02:56.830> si<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.630> even<00:02:58.630> an

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
in a knot like a stacked si or even an

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.400 
in a knot like a stacked si or even an
SI<00:02:59.080> or<00:02:59.470> any<00:02:59.920> type<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.900> any<00:03:01.900> type<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.230> knot

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
SI or any type of any type of knot

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.780 
SI or any type of any type of knot
that's<00:03:02.680> pulling<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> mesh<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.400> outside

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that's pulling the mesh to the outside

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.430 
that's pulling the mesh to the outside
of<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.970> head<00:03:04.120> because<00:03:04.840> what<00:03:05.020> that's<00:03:05.230> going<00:03:05.380> to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
of the head because what that's going to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.260 
of the head because what that's going to
do<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.770> that's<00:03:05.860> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.130> create<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.730> channel

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
do is that's going to create a channel

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.240 
do is that's going to create a channel
that's<00:03:07.570> shaped<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:08.020> lot<00:03:08.260> more<00:03:08.530> like<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> V<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.980> so

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
that's shaped a lot more like a V and so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.010 
that's shaped a lot more like a V and so
you're<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:12.520> going<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.300> same<00:03:13.540> quote

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
you're not going to have the same quote

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.920 
you're not going to have the same quote
Goldilocks<00:03:14.680> effect<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:16.390> would<00:03:16.600> with

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
Goldilocks effect that you would with

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.310 
Goldilocks effect that you would with
more<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:18.430> vertical<00:03:19.150> channel<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.080> see

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
more of a vertical channel that you see

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.160 
more of a vertical channel that you see
in<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:21.280> head<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:22.530> little<00:03:23.530> askew<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:28.170> but

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
in this head a little askew but so but

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.740 
in this head a little askew but so but
so<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.709> main<00:03:32.920> point<00:03:32.950> being<00:03:33.600> when<00:03:34.600> you're

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
so the the main point being when you're

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.140 
so the the main point being when you're
stringing<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.140> defensive<00:03:35.590> head<00:03:35.910> keep<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.030> all

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
stringing in defensive head keep it all

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.410 
stringing in defensive head keep it all
on<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.420> inside<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.230> I'm<00:03:39.220> not<00:03:39.549> not<00:03:40.390> even

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
on the inside so I'm not not even

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.620 
on the inside so I'm not not even
doubling<00:03:41.049> up<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:42.670> why<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.820> love<00:03:43.120> defensive

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
doubling up that's why I love defensive

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.910 
doubling up that's why I love defensive
heads<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:44.290> many<00:03:44.410> stringing<00:03:44.829> holes

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
heads that have so many stringing holes

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.650 
heads that have so many stringing holes
because<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.549> allows<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.120> place

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
because it allows you to just place

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.240 
because it allows you to just place
everything<00:03:47.140> exactly<00:03:47.590> where<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.799> want<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.100> I'm

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
everything exactly where you want it I'm

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.340 
everything exactly where you want it I'm
not<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.430> big<00:03:48.730> fan<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.209> floating<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.079> lot<00:03:50.260> of

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
not a big fan of floating a lot of

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.440 
not a big fan of floating a lot of
diamonds<00:03:50.579> like<00:03:51.579> doing<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.940> double<00:03:52.239> up<00:03:52.360> or

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
diamonds like doing a double up or

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.240 
diamonds like doing a double up or
triple<00:03:52.810> up<00:03:52.959> because<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.410> think<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.860> creates<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
triple up because I think that creates a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.190 
triple up because I think that creates a
shifty<00:03:54.970> or<00:03:55.000> pocket<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.600> therefore<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.019> little

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
shifty or pocket and therefore a little

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.310 
shifty or pocket and therefore a little
more<00:03:56.470> whip<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.660> like<00:03:58.870> having<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.170> more

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
more whip so I like having the more

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.380 
more whip so I like having the more
string<00:03:59.650> holes<00:03:59.860> more<00:04:00.549> stringing<00:04:00.910> holes<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.299> I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
string holes more stringing holes like I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.380 
string holes more stringing holes like I
hate<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.959> hate<00:04:03.870> stringing<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.019> old<00:04:05.200> rev<00:04:05.620> o<00:04:05.769> X

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
hate I hate stringing the old rev o X

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.940 
hate I hate stringing the old rev o X
I'm<00:04:07.390> okay<00:04:07.660> with<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> yellow<00:04:08.079> X<00:04:08.350> but<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.680> rebel

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
I'm okay with the yellow X but the rebel

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.420 
I'm okay with the yellow X but the rebel
ax<00:04:09.130> suggests<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:10.209> don't<00:04:11.049> like<00:04:11.230> having<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.620> to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
ax suggests I don't like having to to

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.830 
ax suggests I don't like having to to
float<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.850> many<00:04:13.030> diamonds<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.630> just

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
float that many diamonds and I just

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.009 
float that many diamonds and I just
don't<00:04:13.930> think<00:04:14.230> it's<00:04:14.380> as<00:04:15.120> consistent<00:04:17.160> so<00:04:19.019> so

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
don't think it's as consistent so so

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.730 
don't think it's as consistent so so
stick<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> ones<00:04:20.769> stick<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.700> your<00:04:21.789> guns

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
stick to the ones stick to your guns
