00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
the 1 by 2 all right then after that you

the 1 by 2 all right then after that you
take<00:01:30.779> your<00:01:31.139> 1<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:31.950> 6<00:01:32.340> flat<00:01:32.939> smooth<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.020> you

place it on top of the 1 by 6 with the
studs<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:37.109> it<00:01:37.139> so<00:01:37.889> the<00:01:38.099> back<00:01:38.279> should<00:01:38.609> look<00:01:38.789> like

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
studs on it so the back should look like

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.550

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this and don't worry hopefully this will

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.849 
this and don't worry hopefully this will
be<00:01:40.740> flush<00:01:41.639> against<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.209> the<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.599> a<00:01:43.590> wall

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
be flush against like the back of a wall

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.349 
be flush against like the back of a wall
so<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.789> won't<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.209> able<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.380> keys<00:01:47.359> all

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
so you won't be able to see the keys all

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.709 
so you won't be able to see the keys all
right<00:01:48.649> after<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.889> you<00:01:50.639> take<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.770> 1<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:53.099> 1

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
right after that you take your 1 by 1

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.219 
right after that you take your 1 by 1
little<00:01:54.719> angled<00:01:55.289> bricks<00:01:55.729> cheese<00:01:56.729> bricks<00:01:57.229> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
little angled bricks cheese bricks and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.659 
little angled bricks cheese bricks and
you<00:01:58.409> place<00:01:58.679> them<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.159> either<00:01:59.700> end<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:01.669> the

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:02.669 
you place them on either end of the

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:05.589 
you place them on either end of the
remaining<00:02:02.999> studs<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.749> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
remaining studs that you can see and

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.419 
remaining studs that you can see and
that's<00:02:06.599> what<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.169> should<00:02:07.319> have<00:02:07.349> so<00:02:07.739> far<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's what you should have so far so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.460 
that's what you should have so far so
that's<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.149> much<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.479> piano<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.259> press

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that's pretty much your piano just press

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
that's pretty much your piano just press
that<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:11.540> last<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.780> take<00:02:12.990> your<00:02:13.170> 1<00:02:13.440> by<00:02:13.620> twos

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
that down last you take your 1 by twos

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.080 
that down last you take your 1 by twos
and<00:02:14.540> then<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.840> put<00:02:16.050> them<00:02:16.400> under

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and then you just put them under

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.470 
and then you just put them under
the<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.349> by<00:02:19.500> two<00:02:20.069> by<00:02:20.220> sixes<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.910> either<00:02:21.150> side

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the one by two by sixes on either side

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.839 
the one by two by sixes on either side
so<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.560> basically<00:02:23.250> how<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> make<00:02:23.700> your

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
so this is basically how to make your

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.740 
so this is basically how to make your
piano<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:25.280> minifig<00:02:26.280> scale<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.420> grabbing<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
piano it's minifig scale just grabbing a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.620 
piano it's minifig scale just grabbing a
random<00:02:28.080> minifigure<00:02:28.530> here<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.390> they<00:02:30.390> can

another<00:02:40.080> way<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.349> do<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> legs<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.910> can

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
another way to do the legs is you can

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.400 
another way to do the legs is you can
take<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.810> by<00:02:43.470> one<00:02:43.830> cans<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.910> replace<00:02:45.690> them

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
take one by one cans and replace them

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.870 
take one by one cans and replace them
you<00:02:46.440> only<00:02:46.769> need<00:02:46.890> four<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.130> them<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.459> replace

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you only need four of them and replace

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.990 
you only need four of them and replace
these<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.160> different<00:02:50.880> looking

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
these so you have different looking

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.330 
these so you have different looking
likes<00:02:51.299> all<00:02:52.260> right<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:52.620> basically<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
likes all right but that's basically it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.090 
likes all right but that's basically it
so<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.840> turquoise<00:02:55.350> five<00:02:55.769> one<00:02:55.980> eight

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
