comparing<00:00:03.780> an<00:00:03.929> iphone<00:00:04.290> 5<00:00:04.560> prototype<00:00:05.220> i

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
comparing an iphone 5 prototype i

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.579 
comparing an iphone 5 prototype i
received<00:00:05.730> from<00:00:05.850> an<00:00:06.029> anonymous<00:00:06.210> source<00:00:06.560> to<00:00:07.560> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
received from an anonymous source to the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.669 
received from an anonymous source to the
iphone<00:00:08.250> 4s<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:09.030> white<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:10.290> most<00:00:10.469> recent

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
iphone 4s in white the most recent

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.539 
iphone 4s in white the most recent
iphone<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.550> apples<00:00:11.849> lineup<00:00:12.559> so<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:14.460> we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
iphone and apples lineup so if we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.939 
iphone and apples lineup so if we
compare<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> both<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.260> see<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
compare the both we can see that the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.750 
compare the both we can see that the
iphone<00:00:17.880> 5<00:00:18.150> prototype<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.250> slightly<00:00:20.250> thinner

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.339 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner
than<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> 4s<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:23.119> is<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.500> quite<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.769> longer

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer
the<00:00:28.349> screen<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.099> larger<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the screen is a lot larger which is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
the screen is a lot larger which is
great<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.779> watching<00:00:31.289> films<00:00:31.529> playing<00:00:32.520> games

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
great for watching films playing games

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.819 
great for watching films playing games
it's<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.300> large<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> samsung<00:00:34.380> galaxy

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's not as large as that samsung galaxy

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.840 
it's not as large as that samsung galaxy
s3<00:00:34.980> screen<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:38.280> too<00:00:38.309> large<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
s3 screen but that's a bit too large for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.130 
s3 screen but that's a bit too large for
my<00:00:39.090> taste<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.800> hits<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> spot<00:00:42.140> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
my taste so this this hits the spot it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
my taste so this this hits the spot it's
same<00:00:43.770> width<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:46.280> it<00:00:47.280> has<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> couple<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> other

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
same width and it has a couple of other

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.170 
same width and it has a couple of other
changes<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.510> well<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.469> take<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> look<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
changes as well we take a look at the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
changes as well we take a look at the
prototype<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> front-facing

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
prototype and see that the front-facing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.260 
prototype and see that the front-facing
camera<00:00:54.270> has<00:00:54.860> moved<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> center<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.149> no

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
camera has moved to the center it's no

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.229 
camera has moved to the center it's no
longer<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> left<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.449> speaker<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:02.239> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
longer to the left of the speaker and of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.030 
longer to the left of the speaker and of
course<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> screen<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.809> larger<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:04.949> we

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
course the screen is larger down here we

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.160 
course the screen is larger down here we
have<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> home<00:01:05.430> button<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:07.850> speaker<00:01:09.170> speaker

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
longer at the top at the top we only

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
longer at the top at the top we only
have<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> hold<00:01:21.210> button<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.930> also<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
have the hold button and we also have a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
have the hold button and we also have a
new<00:01:25.530> dock<00:01:25.920> connector<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> seems<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
new dock connector it seems like the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
new dock connector it seems like the
dock<00:01:27.750> connector<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> 4s<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.430> quite<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> bit

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
dock connector on the 4s is quite a bit

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
dock connector on the 4s is quite a bit
larger<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.829> image

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
larger you take a look at this image

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.560 
larger you take a look at this image
here<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:34.320> looks<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.360> some<00:01:36.360> type<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
here and it looks like this some type of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
here and it looks like this some type of
new<00:01:36.869> dock<00:01:37.110> connector<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.560> Apple<00:01:37.890> has

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
new dock connector that Apple has

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.840 
new dock connector that Apple has
developed<00:01:39.829> obviously<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.310> why<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> can't

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
developed obviously that's why I can't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
developed obviously that's why I can't
plug<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> dock

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
plug it in I don't have this dock

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.530 
plug it in I don't have this dock
connector<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> look<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> back

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
connector we can take a look at the back

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.289 
connector we can take a look at the back
so<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> same<00:01:48.960> camera<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.770> flash<00:01:50.299> apple

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so have the same camera the flash apple

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
so have the same camera the flash apple
logo<00:01:52.250> iphone<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:56.009> seems<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
logo iphone it seems like it's a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.050 
logo iphone it seems like it's a
prototype<00:01:57.149> since<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.310> also<00:01:59.310> has<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> serial

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
prototype since it also has the serial

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.389 
prototype since it also has the serial
number<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> XX<00:02:00.869> XX<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> back<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
number the XX XX you and the back is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.089 
number the XX XX you and the back is
made<00:02:05.549> out<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.939> matte<00:02:06.869> black<00:02:07.320> aluminum<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
made out of a matte black aluminum it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.510 
made out of a matte black aluminum it
seems<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:09.530> nice<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.830> touch<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.250> doesn't

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.070 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't
leave<00:02:11.640> any<00:02:11.790> fingerprints

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
leave any fingerprints

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.010 
leave any fingerprints
and<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:14.190> hope<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> doesn't<00:02:15.390> shatter<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.870> easily

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily
as<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:17.120> 4s<00:02:18.120> does<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.590> take<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
as the 4s does and so you can take a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.160 
as the 4s does and so you can take a
look<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.480> nice<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:22.220> bruise<00:02:23.220> here

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
look here I got nice little bruise here
