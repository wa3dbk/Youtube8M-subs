00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.630
 at the 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.700
 in the investigation is the inspection 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.830
 thanks to a cylinder, we know that 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.890
 the skin is the mirror of what is in the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.300
 inside of the body is going on 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.279
 The skin can be so important to us 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.190
 Information about the procedures in the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.770
 inside of the body 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.110
 So we look at the skin as we see it 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.079
 the skin color is there any 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.739
 changes harder zones pimples or 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.750
 like these elements give us one 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.250
 First hint about what in the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 inside the body is going on 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.450
 next is a global it test 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.239
 or we also put a listening test on it 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.560
 our hand on the head of the patient 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.780
 ask the eyes of the patient 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.450
 close and watch what happens 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.960
 the following movements can be sensed 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.750
 become 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.610
 the patient far back from the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 problem lies on the back of the body 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.520
 the patient far forward from the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.869
 problem lies on the front of the body 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.600
 the patient I was forward in time 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.460
 The fascia pulls in this direction 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.159
 in our example to the left 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.229
 front of the entire body shifts 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.299
 so that the body weight on one 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 Bein bears this indicates a problem 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.280
 in the area of ​​this extremity 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.429
 the test for the segment around in july 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:02:01.319
 Bahle consists of three movements time 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.319
 inclination transaction and rotation 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 once again tilt transaction and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.590
 rotation
