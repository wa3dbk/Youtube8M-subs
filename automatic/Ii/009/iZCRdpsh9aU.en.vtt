00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
so this is the same Cobra philosophy but

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
so this is the same Cobra philosophy but
just<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.250> more<00:02:23.580> hardware<00:02:24.120> feature<00:02:24.390> and

really a good price as you can see on

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.140 
really a good price as you can see on
the<00:02:27.840> right<00:02:28.200> side<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.950> bottom<00:02:29.459> 4

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
