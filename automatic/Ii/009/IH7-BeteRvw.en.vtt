new chair for blusa phone and it is

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.919 
new chair for blusa phone and it is
based<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> same<00:00:14.910> material<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.599> been

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
based on the same material you have been

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
based on the same material you have been
working<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.699> nobody<00:00:18.060> tell<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
working with for the nobody tell you you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.189 
working with for the nobody tell you you
designed<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.980> hey<00:00:20.270> can<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.420> tell<00:00:21.869> us<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
designed for hey can you tell us the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.570 
designed for hey can you tell us the
difference<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.490> new<00:00:23.730> product<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
difference about this new product the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.169 
difference about this new product the
difference<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:28.230> improbably<00:00:28.920> attitudes<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
difference is in improbably attitudes to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.080 
difference is in improbably attitudes to
to<00:00:30.539> design<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.230> general<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
to design in general so it is kind of a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.049 
to design in general so it is kind of a
different<00:00:36.090> point<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.079> view<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> design<00:00:38.100> we

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
different point of view and design we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
different point of view and design we
are<00:00:39.180> normally<00:00:39.570> extremely<00:00:40.079> intolerant<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
are normally extremely intolerant to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
are normally extremely intolerant to
what<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.670> doing<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.239> want<00:00:42.960> everything<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
what we are doing we want everything to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.450 
what we are doing we want everything to
be<00:00:43.620> controlled<00:00:44.239> rather<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.570> controlled<00:00:46.460> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
be controlled rather over controlled so

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.229 
be controlled rather over controlled so
materials<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> obey<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:51.090> have

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
materials they have to obey and we have

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.900 
materials they have to obey and we have
to<00:00:51.390> suppress<00:00:51.930> conquer<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:53.180> violate<00:00:54.180> even<00:00:55.910> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to suppress conquer them violate even to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.790 
to suppress conquer them violate even to
let<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.360> doing<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.469> want<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.500> what

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
let them doing what we want this is what

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.549 
let them doing what we want this is what
yeah<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> long<00:01:03.090> study<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:04.350> three

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
yeah that was a long study for three

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.080 
yeah that was a long study for three
years<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.479> possibilities<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.049> material

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
years of possibilities of this material

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.109 
years of possibilities of this material
trying<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.330> find<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> limits<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.909> can

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
trying to find the limits of what it can

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
trying to find the limits of what it can
actually<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:14.939> probably<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.780> yes<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
actually and then probably the yes you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280 
actually and then probably the yes you
know<00:01:16.650> something<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.720> change<00:01:18.720> something

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
know something the change something

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.990 
know something the change something
switched<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> mind<00:01:20.369> afterwards<00:01:23.000> but

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
switched in the mind afterwards but

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
switched in the mind afterwards but
actually<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.540> long<00:01:24.720> time<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> wanted<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
actually for a long time I wanted to to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.819 
actually for a long time I wanted to to
find<00:01:26.549> another<00:01:27.320> another<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.650> another

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
find another another way another

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
find another another way another
approach<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.729> design<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.110> very

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
approach to design then this very

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
approach to design then this very
masculine<00:01:32.990> saying<00:01:34.220> controlling<00:01:35.220> thing<00:01:36.170> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
masculine saying controlling thing to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.090 
masculine saying controlling thing to
let<00:01:37.350> materials<00:01:37.890> live<00:01:38.159> their<00:01:38.400> own<00:01:38.430> life<00:01:40.100> I'm

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
let materials live their own life I'm

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
let materials live their own life I'm
always<00:01:41.549> admiring<00:01:43.369> rejections<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.960> rejected

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
always admiring rejections this rejected

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.470 
always admiring rejections this rejected
pieces<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.970> factories

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
pieces the factories

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.420 
pieces the factories
waste<00:01:50.730> I'm<00:01:51.730> always<00:01:52.590> grabbing<00:01:53.590> things<00:01:54.040> from

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
waste I'm always grabbing things from

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.430 
waste I'm always grabbing things from
the<00:01:54.550> garbage<00:01:54.760> bins<00:01:55.210> at<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.900> factories

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the garbage bins at the factories

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.770 
the garbage bins at the factories
because<00:01:57.310> they<00:01:57.460> are<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:57.940> much<00:01:58.210> more<00:01:58.240> beautiful

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
because they are so much more beautiful

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.050 
because they are so much more beautiful
than<00:01:59.820> perfectly<00:02:00.820> done<00:02:01.090> product<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.820> is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
than perfectly done product and this is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.470 
than perfectly done product and this is
actually<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.310> attempt<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.550> connect<00:02:07.210> all

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
actually the attempt to connect all

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.680 
actually the attempt to connect all
these<00:02:07.660> things<00:02:08.470> together<00:02:08.710> both<00:02:09.390> knowledge<00:02:10.390> of

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
these things together both knowledge of

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.130 
these things together both knowledge of
material<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.700> ability<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.850> control<00:02:13.330> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
material and ability to control that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.910 
material and ability to control that
part<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.880> need<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> at<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:19.200> yeah<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.650> at

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
part that I need and at this yeah and at

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.400 
part that I need and at this yeah and at
the<00:02:21.070> same<00:02:21.280> time<00:02:21.340> letting<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.240> being<00:02:22.480> free

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the same time letting it being free

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.910 
the same time letting it being free
where<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> don't<00:02:24.700> need<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> letting<00:02:26.590> its

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
where I don't need it so letting its

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.210 
where I don't need it so letting its
behavior<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.600> wants<00:02:28.890> naturally<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.070> do

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
behavior as it wants naturally to do

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.150 
behavior as it wants naturally to do
this<00:02:31.150> these<00:02:31.570> foldings<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.590> see<00:02:32.830> here

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
this these foldings that we see here

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.220 
this these foldings that we see here
that<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.060> part<00:02:34.300> where<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.720> say<00:02:34.960> I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
that that is the part where you say I

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
that that is the part where you say I
don't<00:02:35.770> need<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.250> control<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.880> material<00:02:37.000> at

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
don't need to control the material at

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.340 
don't need to control the material at
these<00:02:37.750> parts<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:39.250> even<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:40.350> these

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
these parts but it's even if these

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.530 
these parts but it's even if these
foldings<00:02:42.130> seem<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.210> very<00:02:44.520> occasional<00:02:45.540> they

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
foldings seem to be very occasional they

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.630 
foldings seem to be very occasional they
have<00:02:46.750> function<00:02:47.290> at<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.740> end<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.340> course

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
have function at the end of course

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.230 
have function at the end of course
because<00:02:49.000> they<00:02:49.450> are<00:02:49.600> each<00:02:49.840> fold<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:51.370> means<00:02:51.760> that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240
