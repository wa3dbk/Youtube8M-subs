00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
there in every time I seem like I was

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.849 
there in every time I seem like I was
getting<00:00:29.390> better<00:00:29.720> i<00:00:30.109> would<00:00:30.229> have<00:00:30.499> something

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
getting better i would have something

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.940 
getting better i would have something
come<00:00:31.069> up<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:31.519> like<00:00:32.210> Anaheim<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:32.899> think<00:00:33.830> that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
come up and like Anaheim I think that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.220 
come up and like Anaheim I think that
was<00:00:34.040> Anaheim<00:00:34.400> to<00:00:34.730> read<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:35.330> that<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:35.870> crashed

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
was Anaheim to read that that I crashed

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.250 
was Anaheim to read that that I crashed
and<00:00:36.530> didn't<00:00:37.360> didn't<00:00:38.360> race<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.630> night<00:00:38.810> show<00:00:38.990> so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
and didn't didn't race the night show so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.660 
and didn't didn't race the night show so
you<00:00:39.890> know<00:00:39.980> just<00:00:40.160> seemed<00:00:40.340> like<00:00:40.370> little

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
you know just seemed like little

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.070 
you know just seemed like little
wrenches<00:00:40.940> got<00:00:41.090> thrown<00:00:41.300> another<00:00:41.420> program<00:00:41.870> but

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
wrenches got thrown another program but

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.760 
wrenches got thrown another program but
all<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:42.260> think<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:42.890> was<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:43.790> been<00:00:44.030> ok<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:45.140> mean

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
all I think it was it's been ok I mean

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.070 
all I think it was it's been ok I mean
it<00:00:45.860> definitely<00:00:45.980> could<00:00:46.250> have<00:00:46.310> been<00:00:46.460> better<00:00:46.640> but

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080
