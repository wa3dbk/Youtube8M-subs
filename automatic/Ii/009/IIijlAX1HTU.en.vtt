00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.080 

behind<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.700> tongue<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.549> they

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
behind the tongue is the same and they

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.250 
behind the tongue is the same and they
don't<00:01:09.240> come<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.450> those<00:01:09.750> red<00:01:10.020> plastic

inserts<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.670> cardboard<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
inserts this is just cardboard so you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.730 
inserts this is just cardboard so you
don't<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
version so that's the difference between

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.179
