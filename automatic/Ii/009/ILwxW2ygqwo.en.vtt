00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.110
 welcome to the new video you already 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.299
 this time around, it can be read 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.649
 tricks and equation we had now 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.120
 the little break in the world 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.530
 Christmas holidays was and there were three 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 weeks then no more videos 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.500
 but now I'm back and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 Now he gets back regularly 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.109
 private videos of me yes, the 13 small 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.490
 the world is an important issue it is slow 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 maybe catching on the clauss 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 to learn one or the other 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 That's why I'd like to have a few 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.080
 gaps are now stuffed into the fabric so far 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 warm for the first semester and above 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.760
 the circle and paralysis in any case 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.560
 to 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 I write it down once and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.800
 Then let's see what happens 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 I would like to be here for now 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 consider serial numbers 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 that could be synonymous with other things 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 as well as one and such things we do 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.550
 look now as normal with 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.629
 a normal amount like it is on 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.770
 every case also in the first semester 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.770
 all need to understand 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.140
 so if we have two real numbers xy 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.059
 and how they react together 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 then the advice is the result smaller 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.410
 same as when we single amount 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.870
 that's basically already around 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.280
 equation that is incredibly useful 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.920
 if you prove about a lot and 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.730
 can use estimates 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.260
 for example if you and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.520
 Convergence must prove 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.600
 Estimate her quite often 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.710
 it helps just the triangles unequal 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.690
 well what can I do I 'll do it 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.800
 use two examples with numbers but 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.510
 I think it should be pretty 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.430
 be trivial and after that we want the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.360
 prove why the three ex um 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.770
 right around a photograph we put 2 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.190
 Paying a number is always the first 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.890
 For example, iks equals two 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.300
 and Iceland equal to three then we know 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.600
 So the amount will be from 2 to 3 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.780
 to him the amount of 5 from which count 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 are 5 let's start from the current 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.729
 amount of iks who is thus amount of 20 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.170
 amount of 3 of the amount of the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.410
 Positive number is simply the number 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.910
 So even 23 and are also five 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.830
 So in that case we have quasi 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.929
 equality inequality is the small one 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.700
 Look in any case that means that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.410
 For example, an example would be risked 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.690
 should she be allergic wise if that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.980
 Set on money to make another one 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.110
 for example, who is unique / -1 and y equals 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.050
 1 then we have one not equality 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 then comes out the amount of ex 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.319
 clubs i lon who are - one plus one 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.170
 that logically gives 0 amount of 00 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.150
 and from the other side amount of -1 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.640
 up to an amount of 1 would be one plus one 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.760
 There are two and two big, so real ones 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.100
 sizes 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.930
 that means we have all in all 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.520
 Bigger is the same here 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.930
 So two examples where it once was money for 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.790
 the same on is a way up 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.560
 that little relation had that 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.540
 that's why it's bigger 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.490
 crucial question is not there now 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.480
 to fill it with examples but when the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.860
 sentence should apply 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.070
 then we have the sentence 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.540
 and I would like to do that 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.880
 know if we have a number aham as 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.500
 any real number is that 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.260
 In any case, less than or equal to the amount 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.120
 from if for if it is positive or 0 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.490
 it would be like him and if he is negative 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.380
 is it so small part of the amount 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.380
 positive is so now can be times 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.290
 is equal to xy 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.239
 so xyz again my two real ones 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.770
 pay if I multiply two 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.160
 I get again a real number, the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.950
 I call now that means I know then 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.370
 logically also at this point 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.440
 that xy small equals the amount of xy 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.660
 his is then I multiply that 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.320
 two-wheeler on both sides then stands there 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:13.430
 two xy is unfortunately twice the 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:14.330
 amount as well should xy far 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.620
 be clear to everyone 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.880
 Now comes a little trick again 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.669
 Now we have to do something again 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.070
 I would like to add in now 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.550
 this case squares seal offered rate 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.700
 add to it 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.270
 like a step arises here 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.330
 expert to two xy luz y in the square and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.960
 this is small same square up 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.419
 twice the amount of xy luz y im 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.960
 square 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:50.390
 so now is the trick when we do it 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.760
 in the square is that you are the same 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.400
 like when i put the amount of ex ins 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.260
 take square then through the square 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.970
 worth your while whether that's positive or not 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.870
 negative for us is not important 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.910
 at square 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.780
 that means I can always just as well 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.700
 the positive again of him here as well 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.090
 oops i lon in the square is the same as 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.680
 amount of y in the square 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.870
 if we look at it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.530
 then I can do it a trick 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.090
 namely, that two amount of xy is yes 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.000
 also it was when I draw two of 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.470
 x times amount of y 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.820
 who comes out of it the positive 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.400
 product and here it comes too 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.360
 positive out only who just gives 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.889
 Just now, and now I can 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.080
 to apply a biological formula 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.240
 you know the genomic formula 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.240
 describes the already applied 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:50.400
 square foot 2a wsbk joined the same 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.620
 brace river b in the square 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000
 who the genomic form please 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.020
 first look at the video 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.460
 genomic forms 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.960
 I should give you a degree at all 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.250
 bh falls quickly really pretty 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.780
 so it's important that we have that 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.070
 then we can see that apply here 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.560
 then there is this page xy and 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.870
 square and that's small then 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.240
 Now we look at that here so 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.300
 amount of ex square foot twice amount 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.940
 of x times amount of y plus amount of y 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.280
 square means that I hold there amount 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.590
 from express amount of y 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.669
 in the square so and now comes the 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.479
 decide trick now I can you 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.479
 to pull the root 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.180
 and then it stands there 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.970
 Okay why I have an intermediate step 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.410
 so forget that then we have as 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.389
 landrat and I have already before 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.819
 said in the square that is rather little 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.909
 the amount around so times amount of 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:07:01.479
 xy in the square is exactly the same 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:03.860
 out and now I see the root 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.690
 that's what this quadratic finds 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.909
 away and can I do if I 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.560
 know that this is both amounts 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.530
 Both of these are positive that means I have to 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.270
 Again, do not change this 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.009
 So I can say small place 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.419
 otherwise I have to be careful 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.130
 in such things if I something 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.509
 quadri or the root cellulose and me 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.819
 have an unequal off in the case 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:26.569
 both work positively then stands 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:28.250
 so xy is less than or equal to 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.080
 ex plus amount of y 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.580
 And that's exactly what our tricks were about 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.580
 equation that we wanted to prove above
