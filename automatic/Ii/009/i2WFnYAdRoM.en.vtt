00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 laminate is a convenient and practical material 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.319
 sometimes it looks no worse than parquet 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.420
 but does not require such thorough care and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.500
 still worth paying attention to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 few details 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.960
 let's start by choosing the first thing you need 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 pay attention is the strength of life in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.380
 cabin over classified by classes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 wear resistance 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 there are three main classes this 31 32 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 33 class the higher the class the higher 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.199
 wear resistance and laminate and its term 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 services 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.050
 the stronger and more durable the more expensive 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.500
 want to improve sound insulation in the apartment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 ask the seller laminate with 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.250
 sound absorbing properties of the following 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.940
 decide on the texture of the floor 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 cover 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 she was glossy rough and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.370
 constraint in register 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.719
 when drawing laminated board 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 fully implemented in volume you can 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.690
 hold your hand and feel the knots tree 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 fiber wood among such a variety 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.000
 not hard and confused but the idea is said 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 Home Lead Specialists 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.869
 common style in which is framed 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.240
 room and of course own 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.560
 preferences prevails design so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.689
 how is this country style anymore 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 rustic whether something is natural then 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.549
 better to choose 12 embossed in register 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.799
 if we talk about practicality, then I would 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.930
 recommended choosing a regular texture in 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.180
 which is less clogged with dirt will not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.770
 it will be very easy to take care of him 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.930
 there will be a maximum service life 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 look for a store before going to the store 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
 information on popular manufacturers 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.540
 floor covering the first four digits 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.939
 barcode 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200
 products indicate the manufacturer does not 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.750
 be lazy to check 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 because the laminate European residence permit can 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.939
 prove to be the work of Chinese workers and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.080
 finally the easiest way to determine 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.290
 quality and laminate 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.660
 board in the store and lightly with your finger 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.820
 push on the edge of the castle if the board 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.360
 this castle will not change its quality 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.980
 forms and will not bend if the laminate 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.320
 cheap or defective lock will start 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.720
 bend and it will be very easy to notice 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.480
 most modern types of laminate 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.729
 water resistant however not 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.420
 it is worth wondering if after washing floors 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.210
 the junction 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.700
 the hostesses themselves sometimes became uneven 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.590
 shorten laminate life and inept 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.970
 leaving the most common mistake 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.980
 which commit 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.330
 mistresses in the care of their laminate they 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 used to wash very large 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.350
 copious amounts of water by no means 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.870
 the case does not need to do this to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.880
 effective care for laminate need 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.340
 use moderate amounts of water and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.530
 just a damp cloth and better for that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.170
 use special mops here on 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.300
 similarity such that in my hand wash 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 laminate strictly in the direction of it 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.280
 laying the surface of the mop should be 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.530
 slightly wet you want the laminate to eat 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.130
 how new add water means by 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.269
 care 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 it is sold in specialized 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.050
 stores you successful shopping and do not give 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.050
 fool yourself
