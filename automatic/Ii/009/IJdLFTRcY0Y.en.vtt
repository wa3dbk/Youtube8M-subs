00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.750 
when I first saw this car I thought
maybe<00:00:36.050> we<00:00:36.290> should<00:00:36.320> make<00:00:36.590> a<00:00:36.620> silent<00:00:37.220> film<00:00:37.400> about

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760

maybe we should make a silent film about
it<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.150> feel<00:00:38.870> like<00:00:39.080> talking<00:00:39.410> about<00:00:39.740> it<00:00:40.100> is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
it I feel like talking about it is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.610 
it I feel like talking about it is
distracting<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.540> viewer<00:00:41.810> from<00:00:42.320> just

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.370 
distracting you the viewer from just
looking<00:00:42.980> at<00:00:43.310> it<00:00:43.490> but<00:00:44.420> making<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.840> silent<00:00:45.230> film

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
looking at it but making a silent film

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.650 
looking at it but making a silent film
would<00:00:45.590> be<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.740> big<00:00:46.010> pretty<00:00:46.280> big<00:00:46.940> pretty<00:00:47.180> indeed

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
would be a big pretty big pretty indeed

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.470 
would be a big pretty big pretty indeed
because<00:00:48.200> you<00:00:49.190> wouldn't<00:00:49.490> get<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.940> share<00:00:50.240> this
