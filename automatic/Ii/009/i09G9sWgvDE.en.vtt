00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
going to talk about in this video so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.049 
going to talk about in this video so
first<00:00:30.390> thing<00:00:30.660> first<00:00:30.929> let's<00:00:31.500> understand<00:00:32.309> why

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
first thing first let's understand why

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.889 
first thing first let's understand why
do<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.690> need<00:00:33.840> part<00:00:34.460> well<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.329> important

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
do we need part well but is an important

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
do we need part well but is an important
nutrient<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.160> needed<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.820> healthy

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
nutrient that is needed for the healthy

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.920 
nutrient that is needed for the healthy
functioning<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:39.899> body<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.739> fat<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.090> an

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
functioning of our body and fat is an

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650 
functioning of our body and fat is an
insulator<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.980> insulates<00:00:44.550> our<00:00:44.850> organs<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
insulator it insulates our organs it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.619 
insulator it insulates our organs it
also<00:00:46.020> acts<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.250> alternative<00:00:47.940> fuel<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
also acts as an alternative fuel in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
also acts as an alternative fuel in
times<00:00:49.020> when<00:00:49.440> sugar<00:00:49.860> from<00:00:50.039> carbohydrates<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
times when sugar from carbohydrates is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.779 
times when sugar from carbohydrates is
not<00:00:51.149> available<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.980> ensures<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.520> proper

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
not available and it ensures the proper

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.650 
not available and it ensures the proper
hormonal<00:00:54.620> functioning<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.190> how<00:00:56.730> much<00:00:57.000> fat<00:00:57.390> do

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
hormonal functioning so how much fat do

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860 
hormonal functioning so how much fat do
you<00:00:57.719> need<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> healthy<00:00:59.180> well<00:01:00.180> before<00:01:00.780> we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you need to be healthy well before we

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
you need to be healthy well before we
get<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> actual<00:01:01.440> figures<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
get to the actual figures let's have a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.469 
get to the actual figures let's have a
look<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.470> world's<00:01:04.470> healthiest<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
look at what world's healthiest and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
look at what world's healthiest and
long-lived<00:01:06.479> cultures<00:01:07.320> consume<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.909> we

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
long-lived cultures consume and if we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
long-lived cultures consume and if we
look<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
look at all of them we will see that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
look at all of them we will see that
they<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:12.000> eat<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.540> low-fat<00:01:13.350> diet
