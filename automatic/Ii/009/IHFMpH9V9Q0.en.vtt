00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
we're going to be learning how to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.550 
we're going to be learning how to
actually<00:00:14.610> display<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.299> inventory<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.080> screen

so<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.940> through<00:00:18.090> our

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
so we're going to be going through our

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.720 
so we're going to be going through our
list<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.140> finding<00:00:19.890> each<00:00:19.980> element<00:00:20.430> within

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
list and finding each element within

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
list and finding each element within
that<00:00:21.029> list<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> displaying<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.470> screen<00:00:22.710> as

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that list and displaying it on screen as

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
that list and displaying it on screen as
a<00:00:23.699> button<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> each<00:00:25.170> button<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:25.980> its

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
a button and each button will have its

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.509 
a button and each button will have its
own<00:00:26.279> name<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.930> what<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> click

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
own name and what not and when you click

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.130 
own name and what not and when you click
on<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.119> cannot<00:00:30.800> do<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> separate<00:00:32.250> function

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
on it you cannot do a separate function

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.190 
on it you cannot do a separate function
depending<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:35.070> button<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.899> but<00:00:36.899> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
depending on which button it is but for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.330 
depending on which button it is but for
right<00:00:37.290> now<00:00:37.320> we're<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
right now we're just going to get the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
right now we're just going to get the
basic<00:00:38.700> setup<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.210> how<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> button<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
basic setup on how to get the button to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.819 
basic setup on how to get the button to
display<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
display so we're going to go in here and

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.380 
display so we're going to go in here and
we're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.370> working<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.090> our<00:00:45.210> ongoing

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we're going to be working in our ongoing

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
we're going to be working in our ongoing
function<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:47.120> we're<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> creating

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
function and we're going to be creating

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
function and we're going to be creating
a<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.110> loop<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.760> creating

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a for loop so we're going to be creating

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
a for loop so we're going to be creating
a<00:00:51.210> variable<00:00:51.510> X<00:00:51.989> equal<00:00:52.440> 0<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.870> if<00:00:54.870> x<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.379> less

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
a variable X equal 0 and if x is less

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
a variable X equal 0 and if x is less
than<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.989> we're<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> be

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
than and then we're going to be

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
than and then we're going to be
referencing<00:00:59.070> our<00:00:59.309> main<00:00:59.940> inventory

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.480 

so<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:06.860> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.399> be

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so pretty much this is going to be

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
so pretty much this is going to be
looping<00:01:08.850> through<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:09.390> main<00:01:09.720> inventory<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
looping through our main inventory and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
looping through our main inventory and
finding<00:01:11.070> every<00:01:11.640> item<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> it'll<00:01:13.350> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
finding every item in here and it'll be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
finding every item in here and it'll be
updating<00:01:14.009> according<00:01:14.460> accordingly<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.509> an

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
updating according accordingly if an

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190 
updating according accordingly if an
item<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> removed<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.460> added<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.170> be

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
item is removed or added so it will be

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.700 
item is removed or added so it will be
able<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> fix<00:01:19.740> itself<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.399> real<00:01:20.970> time<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.710> for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
able to fix itself in real time and for

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
able to fix itself in real time and for
this<00:01:22.799> we're<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.460> using<00:01:23.610> count<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
this we're going to be using count so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.859 
this we're going to be using count so
with<00:01:25.080> raise<00:01:25.649> we<00:01:25.920> use<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> dot<00:01:26.759> length<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.539> find

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
with raise we use a dot length to find

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.130 
with raise we use a dot length to find
all<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.470> items<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.429> array<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.899> for<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
all the items in the array but for a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.090 
all the items in the array but for a
list<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:31.799> comp<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.020> then<00:01:34.020> we'll<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.770> X

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
list we use comp and then we'll do X

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200 
list we use comp and then we'll do X
plus<00:01:35.399> plus

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.570 

now<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:41.080> here<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.650> are<00:01:41.740> going<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.190> creating

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
now in here we are going to be creating

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.140 
now in here we are going to be creating
our<00:01:42.729> actual<00:01:43.150> button<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.830> if<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.700> we're<00:01:45.940> going

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
our actual button so if and we're going

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.450 
our actual button so if and we're going
to<00:01:46.270> create<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.750> green<00:01:48.060> button<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:51.280> is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
to create a green button and this is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.120 
to create a green button and this is
going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.760> be<00:01:51.880> rectangle<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.810> then<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.890> want

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
going to be rectangle and then we want

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.880 
going to be rectangle and then we want
to<00:01:54.220> do<00:01:54.400> screen<00:01:54.909> dot<00:01:55.869> width<00:01:56.790> x<00:01:57.790> 2<00:01:57.850> y<00:01:58.060> 2<00:01:58.770> any<00:01:59.770> of

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
to be adding something a little bit

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.540 
to be adding something a little bit
different<00:02:26.380> we're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:26.980> doing<00:02:27.160> plus

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
different we're going to be doing plus

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.699

and<00:02:28.230> we'll<00:02:29.230> do<00:02:29.410> 20<00:02:29.709> times<00:02:30.700> specs<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.989> might

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
and we'll do 20 times specs I might

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.710 
and we'll do 20 times specs I might
actually<00:02:32.860> adjust<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:34.480> we're

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
actually adjust that but for now we're

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.870 
actually adjust that but for now we're
just<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.170> leave<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.700> until<00:02:36.700> we

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
just going to leave it as that until we

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.410 
just going to leave it as that until we
start<00:02:37.150> testing<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.120> want<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
start testing and then what we want to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.900 
start testing and then what we want to
enter<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.720> here<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.200> um<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.989> 100<00:02:44.530> x<00:02:44.620> 20<00:02:45.100> I'm

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
enter in here is um do 100 x 20 I'm

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.660 
enter in here is um do 100 x 20 I'm
still<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.510> sure<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.519> solve<00:02:48.519> those

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
still not sure if I have to solve those

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.990 
still not sure if I have to solve those
around<00:02:48.910> or<00:02:49.090> not<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:50.100> guess<00:02:51.100> we'll<00:02:51.310> find<00:02:51.579> out<00:02:51.760> in

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
around or not I guess we'll find out in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.740 
around or not I guess we'll find out in
a<00:02:52.090> little<00:02:52.209> bit

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750

dot description for now we're just going
to<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.520> testing<00:03:47.500> each<00:03:48.500> button<00:03:48.920> now<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.100> make

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
to be testing each button now to make

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.060 
to be testing each button now to make
sure<00:03:49.430> they<00:03:50.360> they<00:03:50.990> work<00:03:51.200> differently<00:03:51.410> are<00:03:54.070> so

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
sure they they work differently are so

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.700 
sure they they work differently are so
we<00:03:55.160> can<00:03:55.310> tell<00:03:55.520> if<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.450> bunch<00:03:56.630> are<00:03:57.080> displayed<00:03:57.590> on

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
we can tell if a bunch are displayed on

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.500 
we can tell if a bunch are displayed on
the<00:03:57.800> screen<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.400> when<00:03:58.880> we<00:03:58.970> click<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.330> them

the screen that when we click on them

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.780 
the screen that when we click on them
they<00:03:59.870> do<00:03:59.930> something<00:04:00.440> different<00:04:00.830> so<00:04:01.490> they'll

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.829 
depending on which one I click on so
pretty<00:04:57.409> much<00:04:57.499> how<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:57.979> works<00:04:58.339> is<00:04:58.729> X<00:04:59.659> will

00:04:59.829 --> 00:04:59.839 
pretty much how this works is X will

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.399 
pretty much how this works is X will
start<00:05:00.050> at<00:05:00.169> zero<00:05:00.469> and<00:05:01.089> it'll<00:05:02.089> check<00:05:02.360> for<00:05:02.749> since

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
start at zero and it'll check for since

start at zero and it'll check for since
it's<00:05:03.589> on<00:05:03.800> zero<00:05:04.339> it'll<00:05:05.330> check<00:05:05.509> for<00:05:05.839> the<00:05:06.020> first

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
it's on zero it'll check for the first

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.929 
it's on zero it'll check for the first
item<00:05:07.369> in<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:08.059> in<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.360> list<00:05:09.129> and<00:05:10.129> it<00:05:10.729> will<00:05:10.819> go

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939 
item in the in the list and it will go

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.309 
item in the in the list and it will go
through<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:11.360> will<00:05:11.449> create<00:05:11.599> a<00:05:11.689> button<00:05:11.869> for<00:05:12.169> it

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
through it will create a button for it

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.929 
through it will create a button for it
and<00:05:14.229> pretty<00:05:15.229> much<00:05:15.319> all<00:05:15.589> this<00:05:15.800> code<00:05:16.069> it's<00:05:16.520> added

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:16.939 
and pretty much all this code it's added

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.989 
and pretty much all this code it's added
to<00:05:17.089> that<00:05:17.119> instance<00:05:17.839> of<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.050> button<00:05:18.439> and<00:05:18.999> when

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
to that instance of that button and when

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.540 
to that instance of that button and when
we<00:05:20.119> click<00:05:20.270> on<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.599> it'll<00:05:21.259> be<00:05:21.349> referencing<00:05:21.979> X<00:05:22.249> so

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
we click on it it'll be referencing X so

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.779 
we click on it it'll be referencing X so
whatever<00:05:22.819> X<00:05:23.089> was<00:05:23.360> at<00:05:23.569> that<00:05:23.749> time<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.979> since<00:05:25.610> X

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
whatever X was at that time so since X

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.820 
whatever X was at that time so since X
was<00:05:26.029> at<00:05:26.149> zero<00:05:26.389> for<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:26.599> first<00:05:26.809> one<00:05:27.019> this<00:05:27.679> will

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
was at zero for the first one this will

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.269 
was at zero for the first one this will
be<00:05:27.919> plugged<00:05:28.219> in<00:05:28.399> 40<00:05:29.029> for<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.449> description<00:05:30.019> and

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:30.279 
be plugged in 40 for the description and

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.619 
be plugged in 40 for the description and
when<00:05:31.279> it<00:05:31.369> does<00:05:31.519> plus<00:05:31.699> plus<00:05:31.969> it'll<00:05:32.209> go<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.389> one

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
when it does plus plus it'll go to one

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.579 
when it does plus plus it'll go to one
and<00:05:33.669> this<00:05:34.669> will<00:05:34.879> change<00:05:35.059> to<00:05:35.330> one<00:05:35.539> for<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.229> next

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
and this will change to one for the next

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.369 
and this will change to one for the next
object<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.449> that's<00:05:38.449> how<00:05:38.629> they<00:05:39.139> pop<00:05:39.349> up

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
object and that's how they pop up

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.339 
object and that's how they pop up
different<00:05:39.860> descriptions<00:05:40.399> for<00:05:40.789> each<00:05:41.059> item<00:05:41.389> and

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
different descriptions for each item and

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.550 
different descriptions for each item and
now<00:05:42.740> in<00:05:43.069> here<00:05:43.490> we<00:05:43.729> can<00:05:43.879> actually

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.050 

I<00:05:47.650> believe<00:05:48.639> I<00:05:48.790> can<00:05:48.820> just<00:05:49.150> do<00:05:49.330> plus<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:50.730> don't<00:05:51.730> get

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
I believe I can just do plus I don't get

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.110 
I believe I can just do plus I don't get
any<00:05:52.300> errors<00:05:52.780> I<00:05:53.100> mean<00:05:54.100> inventory<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:54.940> we're

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
any errors I mean inventory and we're

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.320 
any errors I mean inventory and we're
going<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.360> be<00:05:55.510> using<00:05:55.630> X<00:05:55.960> again<00:05:56.290> since<00:05:57.330> that's

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
going to be using X again since that's

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.960 
going to be using X again since that's
that<00:05:59.260> will<00:05:59.410> display<00:05:59.650> each<00:06:00.310> one<00:06:00.580> in<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> list

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
that will display each one in the list

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.810 
that will display each one in the list
and<00:06:01.290> we'll<00:06:02.290> use<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:02.470> name<00:06:02.830> because<00:06:03.370> we<00:06:03.580> want

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
and we'll use that name because we want

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.520 
and we'll use that name because we want
each<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.240> our<00:06:04.389> buttons<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:05.020> have<00:06:05.200> their<00:06:05.500> own

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
each of our buttons to have their own

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.370 
each of our buttons to have their own
name<00:06:05.950> and<00:06:08.430> you<00:06:09.430> have<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.730> use<00:06:09.850> X<00:06:10.150> so<00:06:11.139> when<00:06:11.290> it

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
name and you have to use X so when it

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.080 
name and you have to use X so when it
goes<00:06:11.500> through<00:06:11.889> it<00:06:12.040> but<00:06:12.250> each<00:06:12.580> one<00:06:12.790> in<00:06:12.910> there

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
goes through it but each one in there

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.690 
goes through it but each one in there
and<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.450> grabs<00:06:13.630> each<00:06:13.840> name<00:06:14.130> so<00:06:15.130> we'll<00:06:15.490> just

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
and it grabs each name so we'll just

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.239 
and it grabs each name so we'll just
save<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:15.910> real<00:06:16.300> quick<00:06:17.970> back<00:06:18.970> in<00:06:19.150> here

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:20.249 
save that real quick back in here

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.789 
save that real quick back in here
and<00:06:20.369> you<00:06:21.059> can<00:06:21.209> see<00:06:21.419> our<00:06:21.449> first<00:06:21.809> one<00:06:22.079> is<00:06:22.259> labeled

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:22.799 
and you can see our first one is labeled

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.189 
and you can see our first one is labeled
sword<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.429> our<00:06:23.639> second<00:06:24.059> one<00:06:24.179> that's<00:06:24.359> X<00:06:24.659> and

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
sword and our second one that's X and

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.989 
sword and our second one that's X and
when<00:06:25.409> we<00:06:25.649> click<00:06:25.799> on<00:06:26.009> them<00:06:26.189> they<00:06:26.429> still<00:06:26.669> do<00:06:26.819> the

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 
when we click on them they still do the

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.829 
when we click on them they still do the
same<00:06:27.179> things<00:06:27.419> so<00:06:28.319> now<00:06:28.499> we're<00:06:28.679> able<00:06:28.769> to<00:06:29.839> display

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:30.839 
same things so now we're able to display

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.289 
same things so now we're able to display
each<00:06:31.229> button<00:06:31.709> on<00:06:31.799> the<00:06:31.949> screen<00:06:32.069> for<00:06:32.429> each<00:06:33.149> of

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:33.299 
each button on the screen for each of

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:34.759 
each button on the screen for each of
our<00:06:33.419> items<00:06:33.599> that<00:06:33.989> are<00:06:34.139> in<00:06:34.289> the<00:06:34.619> actual

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:34.769 
our items that are in the actual

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.299 
our items that are in the actual
inventory<00:06:35.219> itself<00:06:35.819> and<00:06:36.739> we're<00:06:37.739> able<00:06:37.889> to<00:06:38.159> use

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:38.309 
inventory itself and we're able to use

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:42.829 
inventory itself and we're able to use
them<00:06:39.319> so<00:06:40.319> that's<00:06:40.889> our<00:06:41.339> basic<00:06:41.639> setup<00:06:42.209> for<00:06:42.569> how

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:42.839 
them so that's our basic setup for how

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.589 
them so that's our basic setup for how
to<00:06:42.899> actually<00:06:43.169> display<00:06:43.469> are<00:06:43.649> going<00:06:43.979> on<00:06:44.069> screen

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
to actually display are going on screen

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.949 
to actually display are going on screen
in<00:06:45.599> the<00:06:45.959> next<00:06:46.199> one<00:06:46.379> I'm<00:06:46.589> going<00:06:46.799> to<00:06:47.479> possibly<00:06:48.479> be

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
in the next one I'm going to possibly be

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:53.589 
in the next one I'm going to possibly be
showing<00:06:49.349> you<00:06:49.439> guys<00:06:49.469> how<00:06:49.679> to<00:06:50.039> set<00:06:50.369> up<00:06:50.399> the<00:06:51.949> the

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
showing you guys how to set up the the

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.719 
showing you guys how to set up the the
when<00:06:54.599> we<00:06:54.779> hover<00:06:54.959> over<00:06:55.259> a<00:06:55.289> button<00:06:55.729> it'll

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
when we hover over a button it'll

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.779 
when we hover over a button it'll
display<00:06:57.119> some<00:06:57.929> of<00:06:57.959> the<00:06:58.139> stats<00:06:58.409> for<00:06:58.799> item<00:06:59.579> and

display some of the stats for item and

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.719 
display some of the stats for item and
we'll<00:07:00.409> be<00:07:01.409> messing<00:07:01.769> around<00:07:01.979> with<00:07:02.279> a<00:07:02.309> lot<00:07:02.519> more

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
we'll be messing around with a lot more

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.759 
we'll be messing around with a lot more
different<00:07:03.419> stuff<00:07:03.569> like<00:07:03.719> that<00:07:03.749> we're<00:07:04.649> also

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:04.769 
different stuff like that we're also

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.409 
different stuff like that we're also
going<00:07:05.039> to<00:07:05.159> be<00:07:05.339> creating<00:07:05.729> a<00:07:05.879> simple

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419
