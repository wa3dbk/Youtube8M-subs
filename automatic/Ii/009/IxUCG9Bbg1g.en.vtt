left hand at least to keep the the
balance<00:01:34.260> going<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.800> here's<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.280> starts<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.460 

octave<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.510> left<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.170> add

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
octave on the left you can actually add

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
octave on the left you can actually add
the<00:01:40.710> e<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the e to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.300

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.940 

now<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.540> move<00:01:59.750> down<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.080> an<00:02:00.170> f-sharp<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.830> the
