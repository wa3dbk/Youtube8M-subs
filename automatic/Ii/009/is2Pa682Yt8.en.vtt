00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hey they're handy my name is Chad and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey they're handy my name is Chad and
I've<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.279> watched<00:00:05.460> your<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.910> of

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
I've just watched your video of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.759 
I've just watched your video of
overclocking<00:00:06.660> an<00:00:07.140> e6<00:00:07.890> 400<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.630> guess<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.990> can

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
overclocking an e6 400 and I guess I can

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.499 
overclocking an e6 400 and I guess I can
help<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> out<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.000> CPU

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
help you out a bit and get your CPU

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.120 
help you out a bit and get your CPU
quite<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> bit<00:00:13.380> further<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.960> e6<00:00:16.560> 400s<00:00:17.070> are

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
quite a bit further the e6 400s are

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.529 
quite a bit further the e6 400s are
meant<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> run<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.820> extremely<00:00:18.300> high<00:00:18.420> speeds

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
meant to run at extremely high speeds

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.580 
meant to run at extremely high speeds
you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.869> 3.5<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.320> spark

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
you can get them up at 3.5 you it spark

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.950 
you can get them up at 3.5 you it spark
white<00:00:22.890> easily<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.510> need<00:00:24.810> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
white easily so I think you just need to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
white easily so I think you just need to
change<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> few<00:00:25.500> things<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
change a few things and you can get that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
change a few things and you can get that
thing<00:00:26.760> much<00:00:26.970> much<00:00:27.180> higher<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.800> gonna

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
thing much much higher so I'm just gonna

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.880 
thing much much higher so I'm just gonna
go<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> load<00:00:30.000> optimise<00:00:30.510> defaults<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.800> we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
go here and load optimise defaults so we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
go here and load optimise defaults so we
can<00:00:32.040> reset<00:00:32.399> everything<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.149> show

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
can reset everything and then I can show

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.020 
can reset everything and then I can show
you<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.130> thing<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.820> want<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
you the first thing you want to go to is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
you the first thing you want to go to is
advanced<00:00:39.030> power<00:00:39.300> settings<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.100> disable

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
advanced power settings and disable

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040 
advanced power settings and disable
anything<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.420> using<00:00:42.719> for

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
anything that you're not using for

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.229 
anything that you're not using for
example<00:00:44.629> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.079> stuff<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:47.270> disable<00:00:48.270> its

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.110 

that's<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.690> its<00:00:54.870> screen<00:00:55.680> little<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that's just its screen little bit you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
that's just its screen little bit you
get<00:00:57.859> to<00:00:58.859> say<00:00:59.010> where<00:00:59.160> anything<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> you're

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
get to say where anything that you're

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
get to say where anything that you're
not<00:00:59.820> using<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.620> using

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
not using because if you're not using

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.539 
not using because if you're not using
that's<00:01:02.219> probably<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.780> take<00:01:03.780> away<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.430> bit<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that's probably gonna take away a bit of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.890 
that's probably gonna take away a bit of
the<00:01:06.380> clock<00:01:07.380> ability<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:09.409> processor<00:01:10.670> so

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
the clock ability of your processor so

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
the clock ability of your processor so
when<00:01:12.900> you're<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.380> main<00:01:13.650> menu<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.490> Radek

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
when you're in this main menu like Radek

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.350 
when you're in this main menu like Radek
here<00:01:15.710> hits<00:01:16.710> control<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.939> you'll<00:01:18.180> see

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
here hits control if one and you'll see

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.899 
here hits control if one and you'll see
the<00:01:18.479> screen<00:01:18.689> sort<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> flash<00:01:19.640> when<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> can

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the screen sort of flash when you can

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.260 
the screen sort of flash when you can
you<00:01:21.030> didn't<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you didn't they then you're gonna that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
you didn't they then you're gonna that
enables<00:01:24.810> some<00:01:25.259> other<00:01:25.470> option<00:01:25.799> options<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
enables some other option options in the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.140 
enables some other option options in the
bars<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> firstly<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.490> you've<00:01:29.729> done<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
bars so firstly what you've done is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
bars so firstly what you've done is
you've<00:01:30.479> changed<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:32.720> speed<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> FSB

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you've changed the speed here of the FSB

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.910 
you've changed the speed here of the FSB
to<00:01:35.009> 380

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
to 380

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.039 
to 380
alright<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.250> cool<00:01:38.750> first<00:01:39.750> problem

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
alright so that's cool first problem

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.560 
alright so that's cool first problem
though<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:41.930> your<00:01:42.930> system<00:01:43.740> memory<00:01:43.920> multiplier

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
though is your system memory multiplier

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
though is your system memory multiplier
well<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.049> DRAM<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:47.790> B

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
well that's your DRAM and if there's B

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.350 
well that's your DRAM and if there's B
ratio<00:01:48.350> put<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.649> two<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:51.149> rounds

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
ratio put that at two and your rounds

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.270 
ratio put that at two and your rounds
gonna<00:01:51.450> run<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:51.960> seven<00:01:52.649> hundred<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> sixty

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
gonna run at seven hundred and sixty

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.910 
gonna run at seven hundred and sixty
minutes<00:01:53.670> yes<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.770> as

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
minutes yes we know that it's not as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.969 
minutes yes we know that it's not as
fast<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.340> 900<00:01:56.939> plus<00:01:57.240> makers<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
fast as 900 plus makers but that is

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.389 
fast as 900 plus makers but that is
what's<00:01:59.189> holding<00:01:59.280> your<00:02:00.860> stability<00:02:01.860> back

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
what's holding your stability back

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.260 
what's holding your stability back
should<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> say<00:02:04.250> next<00:02:05.250> change<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.700> PCIe

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
should I say next change your PCIe

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.309 
should I say next change your PCIe
frequency<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:08.489> 100<00:02:08.819> makers<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.289> are

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
frequency to about 100 makers if you are

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.770 
frequency to about 100 makers if you are
looking<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:11.799> benchmarks<00:02:12.310> little<00:02:12.579> higher<00:02:12.879> but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
looking for benchmarks little higher but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.589 
looking for benchmarks little higher but
on<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.260> past<00:02:15.180> 125<00:02:16.180> minutes<00:02:16.739> safely<00:02:18.599> maybe

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
on the past 125 minutes safely maybe

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.470 
on the past 125 minutes safely maybe
hundred<00:02:19.989> thirty<00:02:20.170> minutes<00:02:20.769> if<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:22.209> you're

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
hundred thirty minutes if if you're

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.089 
hundred thirty minutes if if you're
lucky<00:02:22.629> alright<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:25.200> yeah<00:02:26.200> I'm<00:02:26.739> gonna<00:02:26.950> actually

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
lucky alright so yeah I'm gonna actually

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.309 
lucky alright so yeah I'm gonna actually
put<00:02:27.370> mine<00:02:27.519> at<00:02:27.549> 400<00:02:28.239> goes<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.870> our<00:02:28.989> mind<00:02:29.170> can

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
put mine at 400 goes on our mind can

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.839 
put mine at 400 goes on our mind can
handle<00:02:29.650> quite<00:02:30.340> easily

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
handle quite easily

your<00:03:10.419> amp<00:03:10.629> should<00:03:10.840> be<00:03:10.930> able<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.199> do<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.439> if<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
your amp should be able to do that if it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.189 
your amp should be able to do that if it
would<00:03:11.859> reach<00:03:12.040> 900<00:03:12.609> meters<00:03:13.739> next<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:16.199> your

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
would reach 900 meters next is your

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.270 
would reach 900 meters next is your
voltages<00:03:17.939> firstly<00:03:18.939> do<00:03:19.329> not<00:03:19.479> put<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:19.900> at<00:03:20.280> 1.5

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
voltages firstly do not put this at 1.5

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.599 
voltages firstly do not put this at 1.5
volts<00:03:21.669> so<00:03:22.090> your<00:03:22.389> CPU<00:03:23.229> voltage<00:03:23.379> at<00:03:23.769> 1.5<00:03:24.310> volts

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
volts so your CPU voltage at 1.5 volts

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.429 
volts so your CPU voltage at 1.5 volts
that<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.509> absolute<00:03:25.959> madness<00:03:27.959> 1.5<00:03:28.959> volts<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439
