messing around with the Catelyn bread
supercharged<00:00:08.620> overdrive<00:00:09.160> pedal

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.110 

so<00:00:59.900> as<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.560> can<00:01:00.710> hear<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.490> pedal<00:01:01.910> is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
so as you can hear this pedal is

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.690 
so as you can hear this pedal is
definitely<00:01:02.750> about<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.110> rock<00:01:03.320> it's<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.220> medium

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
definitely about the rock it's a medium

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.840 
definitely about the rock it's a medium
to<00:01:04.880> high<00:01:04.910> gain<00:01:05.390> distortion<00:01:06.080> pedal<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.850> when

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
to high gain distortion pedal and when

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.690 
to high gain distortion pedal and when
you<00:01:07.970> step<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.780> says<00:01:09.050> rock<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:10.520> says

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
you step on it it says rock it just says

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.920 
you step on it it says rock it just says
rock<00:01:11.680> that's<00:01:12.680> really<00:01:13.070> useful<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.670> me<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.450> play<00:01:14.900> a

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
rock that's really useful to me I play a

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.590 
rock that's really useful to me I play a
lot<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.170> different<00:01:15.290> genres<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:15.890> music<00:01:16.010> and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
lot of different genres of music and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.520 
lot of different genres of music and
sometimes<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:18.050> playing<00:01:18.500> R&amp;B<00:01:19.070> or<00:01:19.490> hip-hop<00:01:19.700> and

sometimes I'm playing R&amp;B or hip-hop and
you<00:01:21.530> need<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.770> make<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.130> rock<00:01:22.880> sound<00:01:23.680> but<00:01:24.680> you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
you need to make that rock sound but you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.440 
you need to make that rock sound but you
don't<00:01:25.280> want<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.580> be<00:01:25.730> some<00:01:26.090> sort<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.330> a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
don't want it to be some sort of a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.500 
don't want it to be some sort of a
generic<00:01:26.869> over<00:01:27.470> compressed<00:01:28.420> sort<00:01:29.420> of

artificial<00:01:30.380> sounding<00:01:30.920> rock<00:01:31.190> sound<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:32.119> want

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
artificial sounding rock sound you want

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.380 
artificial sounding rock sound you want
it<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.540> be<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:33.200> rock<00:01:33.590> sound<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:35.030> pedal

it to be that rock sound and this pedal

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.570 
it to be that rock sound and this pedal
does<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.570> really<00:01:35.840> good<00:01:36.020> job<00:01:36.080> of<00:01:36.530> producing<00:01:36.860> that

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
does a really good job of producing that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.230 
does a really good job of producing that
rock<00:01:37.910> sound<00:01:38.590> but<00:01:39.590> still<00:01:39.890> allowing<00:01:40.670> some<00:01:41.210> of

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
rock sound but still allowing some of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.300 
rock sound but still allowing some of

bottom and staying pretty tight if you
set<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.229> up<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.560> way<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.670> even<00:01:49.940> into<00:01:50.360> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
set it up that way so that even into you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.620 
set it up that way so that even into you
know<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.170> smaller<00:01:51.710> amplifier<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.420> car

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
know a smaller amplifier like the car

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
amplifier like that it can thump like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.000 
amplifier like that it can thump like
you're<00:02:00.440> playing<00:02:00.650> into<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.890> larger<00:02:01.340> cab<00:02:01.990> okay

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
you're playing into a larger cab okay

also<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.730> top<00:02:04.970> end<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.450> not<00:02:05.960> excessively

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
also the top end is not excessively

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.609 
also the top end is not excessively
bright<00:02:07.360> there's<00:02:08.360> enough<00:02:08.630> there<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:09.230> string

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619

going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.590> know<00:02:15.620> make<00:02:16.060> cats<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.600> insane

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
going to you know make cats go insane

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.500 
going to you know make cats go insane
and<00:02:18.290> mess<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:19.510> high-frequency

hearing<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:22.640> don't<00:02:22.790> think<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.030> will

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
hearing I really don't think it will

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.990 
hearing I really don't think it will
there's<00:02:24.110> no<00:02:24.260> tone<00:02:24.470> control<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.100> but<00:02:25.730> it's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
there's no tone control on it but it's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.360 
there's no tone control on it but it's
like<00:02:26.620> apparently<00:02:27.620> most<00:02:27.800> Catalan<00:02:28.190> bread

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
like apparently most Catalan bread

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.370

pedals<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:29.209> really<00:02:29.450> well<00:02:29.630> voiced<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.230> I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
pedals really really well voiced and I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.960 
pedals really really well voiced and I
didn't<00:02:30.590> miss<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.800> at<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.160> last<00:02:31.459> night<00:02:31.610> when<00:02:31.940> I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
didn't miss it at all last night when I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.060 
didn't miss it at all last night when I
used<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> gig<00:02:32.810> where<00:02:33.260> had<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.530> make<00:02:33.680> lots

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
used it on a gig where had to make lots

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.040 
used it on a gig where had to make lots
of<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.430> rock<00:02:34.670> sound<00:02:35.030> even<00:02:35.570> played<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> heart

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
of that rock sound even played a heart

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.250 
of that rock sound even played a heart
cover<00:02:36.320> which<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:36.739> exciting<00:02:37.250> because<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.450> loved

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
cover which was exciting because I loved

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.580

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
liked the connection it was exciting for

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.560 
liked the connection it was exciting for
me<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.070> worked<00:02:58.220> really<00:02:58.400> really<00:02:58.519> well<00:02:58.820> now

it's<00:03:00.200> got<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.440> volume<00:03:00.739> control<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> gain

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
it's got a volume control and a gain

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's got a volume control and a gain
control<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.780> low<00:03:03.079> end<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.680> gain<00:03:04.670> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.620 

still<00:03:07.830> pretty<00:03:08.010> dirty<00:03:08.340> okay<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.839 
still pretty dirty okay this is not you
know<00:03:09.750> kind<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.260> light<00:03:10.770> overdrive<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.670> here's

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
know kind of a light overdrive so here's

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.260 
know kind of a light overdrive so here's
the<00:03:11.970> low<00:03:12.090> end<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.450> game<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:17.340> here's<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
the low end of the game and here's the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.800 
the low end of the game and here's the
clean<00:03:18.510> sound<00:03:22.819> so<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.030> hear<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.390> amp<00:03:24.600> is

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
clean sound so you can hear the amp is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
clean sound so you can hear the amp is
completely<00:03:25.290> clean<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.860> amp<00:03:26.040> has<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> lot<00:03:26.370> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
completely clean this amp has a lot of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.090 
completely clean this amp has a lot of
headroom<00:03:26.610> by<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.940> way<00:03:27.350> but<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
headroom by the way but all the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.470 
headroom by the way but all the
distortions<00:03:29.400> coming<00:03:29.880> from<00:03:30.000> here<00:03:30.209> you're<00:03:30.360> not

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
distortions coming from here you're not

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.780 
distortions coming from here you're not
going<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:30.989> real<00:03:31.530> low<00:03:31.800> gain<00:03:32.100> overdrive

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
going to get real low gain overdrive

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.840 
going to get real low gain overdrive
tones<00:03:33.090> out<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.819> gain<00:03:38.819> knob

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
tones out of this there is a gain knob

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.750 
tones out of this there is a gain knob
obviously<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:40.140> when<00:03:40.410> maxed<00:03:40.890> out<00:03:41.040> really

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
obviously which when maxed out really

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.550 
obviously which when maxed out really
gets<00:03:42.000> us<00:03:42.150> into<00:03:42.300> kind<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.600> fuzz<00:03:42.780> territory<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
gets us into kind of fuzz territory and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.259 
gets us into kind of fuzz territory and
some<00:03:43.709> beautiful<00:03:44.010> sounds<00:03:44.549> especially<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:45.150> the

setting and I'm gonna turn it all the
way<00:04:36.950> counterclockwise<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.720> far<00:04:38.960> I've<00:04:39.110> had<00:04:39.260> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380

turned all the way clockwise for the
tightest<00:04:41.240> possible<00:04:41.720> base<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:42.560> was

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
tightest possible base and that was

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.100 
tightest possible base and that was
really<00:04:43.100> helpful<00:04:43.370> live<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:44.630> me<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.840> get<00:04:44.990> my

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.900 
for the tight base okay and we'll go all
the<00:05:02.870> way<00:05:02.900> counterclockwise<00:05:03.639> for<00:05:04.639> what<00:05:04.790> they

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
the way counterclockwise for what they

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.020 
the way counterclockwise for what they
describe<00:05:05.300> as<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.510> more<00:05:05.690> open<00:05:06.080> sound

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.760 

so<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.479> is<00:05:13.630> pretty<00:05:13.750> interesting<00:05:14.080> because<00:05:14.470> as

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
so this is pretty interesting because as

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.980 
so this is pretty interesting because as
you<00:05:14.919> sort<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.850> open<00:05:16.150> up<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.419> base<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.870> it's

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
you sort of open up the base and it's

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.620 
you sort of open up the base and it's
not<00:05:17.139> as<00:05:17.380> tight<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:18.220> get<00:05:18.430> sort<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.940> what<00:05:19.360> sounds

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
not as tight you get sort of what sounds

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.749 
not as tight you get sort of what sounds
to<00:05:19.690> my<00:05:19.900> ear<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.380> more<00:05:20.650> harmonic<00:05:21.190> content<00:05:21.610> and

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
to my ear like more harmonic content and

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.790 
to my ear like more harmonic content and
a<00:05:21.789> little<00:05:22.000> more<00:05:22.120> harmonic<00:05:22.600> interest<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.620> the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
a little more harmonic interest so the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.080 
a little more harmonic interest so the
high<00:05:23.919> notes<00:05:24.100> are<00:05:24.220> going<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> change<00:05:24.580> too<00:05:24.850> right

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
high notes are going to change too right

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:33.469 
high notes are going to change too right
so<00:05:25.840> all<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.680> way<00:05:26.770> over<00:05:27.100> clockwise<00:05:27.669> here<00:05:27.729> we<00:05:28.240> go

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.520 

that's<00:05:34.479> with<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:34.810> all<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.199> way<00:05:35.289> clockwise

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
that's with it all the way clockwise

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.890 
that's with it all the way clockwise
tight<00:05:36.220> bass<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.910> here<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.539> all<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.750> way

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
tight bass and here it is all the way

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:47.460 
tight bass and here it is all the way
counterclockwise<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:46.300> my<00:05:46.449> ears<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.990> sounds

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
counterclockwise to my ears that sounds

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.490 
counterclockwise to my ears that sounds
a<00:05:47.710> little<00:05:48.130> bit<00:05:48.310> more<00:05:48.460> dynamic<00:05:48.930> like<00:05:49.930> how<00:05:50.229> hard

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
a little bit more dynamic like how hard

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.810 
a little bit more dynamic like how hard
I<00:05:50.620> pick<00:05:50.860> controls<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.310> little<00:05:51.520> bit<00:05:51.610> more<00:05:51.789> a

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
I pick controls a little bit more a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.730 
I pick controls a little bit more a
little<00:05:52.240> bit<00:05:52.270> less<00:05:52.419> compressed<00:05:52.900> how<00:05:53.410> hard<00:05:53.650> I

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
little bit less compressed how hard I

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.650 
little bit less compressed how hard I
pick<00:05:53.949> controls<00:05:54.340> how<00:05:54.490> much<00:05:54.669> distortion<00:05:55.090> we<00:05:55.419> get

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
pick controls how much distortion we get

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.480 
pick controls how much distortion we get
so<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.199> contour<00:05:56.530> knob<00:05:56.800> is<00:05:56.979> giving<00:05:57.220> us<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.340> whole

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
so the contour knob is giving us a whole

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.040 
so the contour knob is giving us a whole
range<00:05:57.760> of<00:05:57.970> colors<00:05:58.180> but<00:05:58.630> not<00:05:58.660> in<00:05:58.960> a

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
range of colors but not in a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.260 
range of colors but not in a
conventional<00:05:59.650> way<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.160> as<00:06:00.699> it<00:06:00.880> turns<00:06:01.090> out

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
conventional way and as it turns out

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.930 
conventional way and as it turns out
again<00:06:01.599> in<00:06:01.840> a<00:06:01.960> live<00:06:02.169> setting<00:06:02.560> this<00:06:03.310> way<00:06:03.729> of

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
again in a live setting this way of

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.390 
again in a live setting this way of
controlling<00:06:04.449> the<00:06:04.630> pedal<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:05.169> thought<00:06:06.070> was<00:06:06.220> kind

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
controlling the pedal I thought was kind

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.249 
controlling the pedal I thought was kind
of<00:06:06.430> unique<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:06.970> really<00:06:07.509> really<00:06:07.660> functional

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
of unique and really really functional

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.050 
of unique and really really functional
it<00:06:08.410> worked<00:06:08.680> really<00:06:08.979> really<00:06:09.130> well<00:06:09.370> for<00:06:09.550> me<00:06:09.910> I

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
it worked really really well for me I

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.960 
it worked really really well for me I
also<00:06:10.780> use<00:06:10.960> the<00:06:11.139> pedal<00:06:11.440> at<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.789> rehearsal<00:06:13.260> and

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
also use the pedal at a rehearsal and

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.500 
also use the pedal at a rehearsal and
kind<00:06:15.970> of<00:06:16.060> used<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.449> as<00:06:16.570> just<00:06:16.870> a<00:06:16.960> solo<00:06:17.260> sort<00:06:18.070> of

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
kind of used it as just a solo sort of

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.460 
kind of used it as just a solo sort of
saturated<00:06:19.510> you<00:06:19.720> know<00:06:19.840> kind<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.860> a<00:06:21.190> solo<00:06:22.000> pedal

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
saturated you know kind of a solo pedal

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.379 
saturated you know kind of a solo pedal
in<00:06:23.470> kind<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.889> quiet<00:06:24.130> stuff<00:06:24.550> actually<00:06:24.909> without

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
in kind of quiet stuff actually without

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.730 
in kind of quiet stuff actually without
a<00:06:25.419> drummer<00:06:25.780> acoustic<00:06:26.199> stuff<00:06:26.349> and<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.560> worked

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
a drummer acoustic stuff and it worked

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.890 
a drummer acoustic stuff and it worked
really<00:06:26.800> well<00:06:26.979> you<00:06:27.340> can<00:06:27.490> get<00:06:27.699> you<00:06:28.090> know<00:06:28.180> tons<00:06:28.510> of

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
really well you can get you know tons of

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.890 
really well you can get you know tons of
sustain<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:30.010> no<00:06:30.490> don't<00:06:30.970> even<00:06:31.270> try<00:06:31.479> to<00:06:31.510> make<00:06:31.659> me

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
sustain and no don't even try to make me

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.450 
sustain and no don't even try to make me
say<00:06:32.050> endless<00:06:32.470> and<00:06:32.590> creamy<00:06:32.860> because<00:06:33.190> I'm<00:06:33.310> just

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
say endless and creamy because I'm just

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.710 
say endless and creamy because I'm just
not<00:06:33.580> going<00:06:33.940> to<00:06:34.030> put<00:06:34.180> those<00:06:34.300> words<00:06:34.479> together

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
not going to put those words together

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.640 
not going to put those words together
with<00:06:35.169> sustain<00:06:35.620> it's<00:06:36.250> not<00:06:36.370> gonna<00:06:36.520> happen<00:06:36.699> but

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
with sustain it's not gonna happen but

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.290 
with sustain it's not gonna happen but
we'll<00:06:38.650> go<00:06:38.800> all<00:06:39.099> the<00:06:39.280> way<00:06:39.310> clockwise<00:06:39.639> we'll<00:06:40.120> put

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
we'll go all the way clockwise we'll put

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.939 
we'll go all the way clockwise we'll put
the<00:06:40.389> concert<00:06:40.720> now<00:06:40.960> but<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.139> middle<00:06:41.440> setting<00:06:41.830> and

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
the concert now but a middle setting and

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.080 
the concert now but a middle setting and
you'll<00:06:42.039> see<00:06:42.220> you<00:06:42.310> get<00:06:42.430> an<00:06:42.550> awful<00:06:42.940> lot<00:06:43.060> of

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
you'll see you get an awful lot of

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:50.580 
you'll see you get an awful lot of
sustain

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.200 

and<00:06:51.590> you<00:06:51.710> can<00:06:51.830> see<00:06:52.039> I'm<00:06:52.220> not<00:06:52.370> at<00:06:52.550> a<00:06:52.639> ridiculous

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
and you can see I'm not at a ridiculous

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.830 
and you can see I'm not at a ridiculous
volume<00:06:53.599> I<00:06:53.720> can<00:06:53.870> talk<00:06:54.050> over<00:06:55.539> but<00:06:56.539> it's<00:06:56.659> still

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
volume I can talk over but it's still

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.300 
volume I can talk over but it's still
pretty<00:06:56.990> dynamic<00:06:57.680> it's<00:06:57.889> not<00:06:59.259> gross<00:07:00.259> it's<00:07:01.099> not

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
pretty dynamic it's not gross it's not

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.240 
pretty dynamic it's not gross it's not
gross<00:07:01.639> it's<00:07:02.210> not<00:07:02.389> a<00:07:02.419> gross<00:07:02.840> kind<00:07:03.199> of<00:07:03.319> endless

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
gross it's not a gross kind of endless

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.040 
gross it's not a gross kind of endless
creamy<00:07:04.699> sustain<00:07:05.210> I<00:07:05.770> said<00:07:06.770> it<00:07:07.419> it's<00:07:08.419> there's

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
creamy sustain I said it it's there's

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.659 
creamy sustain I said it it's there's
something<00:07:09.379> sort<00:07:09.590> of<00:07:09.740> musical<00:07:10.220> and<00:07:10.400> kind<00:07:10.639> of

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
something sort of musical and kind of

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.300 
something sort of musical and kind of
hip<00:07:10.849> and<00:07:11.060> still<00:07:11.270> kind<00:07:11.539> of<00:07:11.690> fun<00:07:11.840> about<00:07:11.870> it<00:07:12.310> it's

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
hip and still kind of fun about it it's

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.180 
hip and still kind of fun about it it's
not<00:07:13.490> making<00:07:13.759> me<00:07:14.000> queasy<00:07:14.650> so<00:07:15.650> all<00:07:15.919> in<00:07:16.069> all
