00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 if I can think of my story 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.720
 I sometimes hardly believe that we have them 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.919
 I have myself followed Stefan 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 my great love 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.769
 our plan a life on the sea and on 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.210
 the most beautiful coasts in the world 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.789
 the blue water lives of us already 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 had dreamed for so long 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.800
 We have a movie with faith life 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.090
 turned 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 blue after a true story 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.039
 water life is through in the book of heike 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.279
 For me it was the first time that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.200
 I played someone who is still alive 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.469
 and the one hell of a terrible thing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 has happened 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.720
 I want that to be very accurate 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.780
 followed what happened there at that time 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:53.460
 excuse them do not chase you win 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:57.210
 that is our national sport only that came 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.070
 will be filmed bad now then 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 I have read the book and has given me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.160
 then thought how can you do that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.120
 play a role as markus on the beach 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.220
 with the native children 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.270
 You have to fool around in the water here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.000
 smile a bit 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.790
 that would have been so one-to-one stefan 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 I think marx 2 stefan we would 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 very well understood 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.229
 that's how the book was for me back then 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.870
 It's the first therapy I can see that now 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.400
 as another year 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.220
 it was a big gift for me 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.479
 show that by turning 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.070
 I was incredibly calm because I was 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.450
 Did you know if anything? 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 what might be wrong or not 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 right then there is someone who really is 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.450
 say 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.200
 she wanted to rape and kill her 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.600
 they have to believe me i have to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 nothing at all we tell you how they do it 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.280
 creates that promise to survive there 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.120
 were to come to terms with it and yourself 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.120
 not to break
