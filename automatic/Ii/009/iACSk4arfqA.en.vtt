to replace the fuel line on your to come
say<00:00:04.529> snow<00:00:04.950> king<00:00:05.250> snowblower<00:00:05.940> engine<00:00:06.830> first<00:00:07.830> I

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
say snow king snowblower engine first I

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.259 
say snow king snowblower engine first I
want<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> start<00:00:08.370> by<00:00:08.550> removing<00:00:08.849> these<00:00:09.210> two

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
want to start by removing these two

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.020 
want to start by removing these two
screws<00:00:10.130> there'll<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.160> another<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.730> over<00:00:12.000> here

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
screws there'll be another one over here

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.499 
screws there'll be another one over here
and<00:00:13.190> there<00:00:14.190> will<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.340> another<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.150> top

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and there will be another one up top

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
and there will be another one up top
here<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> engine<00:00:17.310> I'm<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> use

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
here this is the engine I'm going to use

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330 
here this is the engine I'm going to use
to<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.449> today<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> same<00:00:19.350> principle

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
to do this today it's the same principle

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.340 
to do this today it's the same principle
the<00:00:20.580> fuel<00:00:21.000> line<00:00:21.180> goes<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> exact<00:00:22.140> same

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the fuel line goes in the exact same

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.980 
the fuel line goes in the exact same
spot<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> once<00:00:24.090> you've<00:00:24.269> removed<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.720> two

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
spot so once you've removed the two

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.880 
spot so once you've removed the two
screws<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.670> other<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:28.560> cover

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
screws here and the other two this cover

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.060 
screws here and the other two this cover
is<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> come<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:31.500> also<00:00:31.679> want<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
is going to come off you also want to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.729 
is going to come off you also want to
remove<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.610> choke<00:00:33.149> knob<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.079> pulling<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
remove the choke knob just by pulling on

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
remove the choke knob just by pulling on
you'll<00:00:35.250> notice<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.910> wire<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> key

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you'll notice that the wire from the key

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010 
you'll notice that the wire from the key
is<00:00:36.989> Soton<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.950> cover<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.570> simply

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
is Soton to this cover so it just simply

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
is Soton to this cover so it just simply
loosen<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.070> screw<00:00:41.129> over<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.930> don't

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
loosen this screw over here you don't

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
loosen this screw over here you don't
need<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.410> remove<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> screw<00:00:44.129> completely<00:00:44.489> just

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
need to remove the screw completely just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
need to remove the screw completely just
loosen<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.559> hooks<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
loosen it and then the hooks going to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
loosen it and then the hooks going to
come<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:48.390> also<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
come out like that we're also going to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
come out like that we're also going to
remove<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.890> shroud<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:51.960> going

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
remove this shroud here so there's going

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.979 
remove this shroud here so there's going
to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.559> bolts<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:54.270> down<00:00:54.570> here

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to be two bolts here and one down here

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.500 
to be two bolts here and one down here
and<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.920> down<00:00:56.670> over<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> other

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and one down over there on the other

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.619 
and one down over there on the other
side<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> these<00:00:59.129> bolts<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.579> top<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.090> are<00:01:00.390> 1/2

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
side so these bolts on top here are 1/2

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.590 
side so these bolts on top here are 1/2
inch<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.199> size

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.030 

the<00:01:08.600> next<00:01:08.900> bolt<00:01:09.110> we're<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.530> remove<00:01:09.830> is

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
the next bolt we're going to remove is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.840 
the next bolt we're going to remove is
right<00:01:10.310> down<00:01:10.549> here<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.000> it's<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.540> 7/16<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:18.850> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
right down here and it's a 7/16 and the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.490 
right down here and it's a 7/16 and the
last<00:01:20.060> one<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.689> down<00:01:20.899> here<00:01:20.930> underneath

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
last one is right down here underneath

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.800 
last one is right down here underneath
the<00:01:21.619> gas<00:01:21.770> tank<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.700> shroud<00:01:26.060> should

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
the gas tank so now this shroud should

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.789 
the gas tank so now this shroud should
come<00:01:27.049> up<00:01:28.570> don't<00:01:29.570> forget<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.229> linkage<00:01:30.619> is

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
come up don't forget that the linkage is

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.460 
come up don't forget that the linkage is
still<00:01:31.009> hooked<00:01:31.220> up<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.729> card<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:33.170> I'll<00:01:33.259> show

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470

you how to take that off
next<00:01:35.330> I'm<00:01:35.450> going<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.630> remove<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.110> linkage

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
next I'm going to remove the linkage

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.899 
next I'm going to remove the linkage
here<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.570> speed<00:01:39.170> control<00:01:39.909> remember

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
here from the speed control remember

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.790 
here from the speed control remember
which<00:01:41.149> hole<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.509> take<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:42.080> out<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.229> because

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
which hole you take it out of because

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.260 
which hole you take it out of because
you<00:01:42.950> want<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.159> put<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.429> back<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.970> exact

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
you want to put it back in the exact

like that and hole shrouds off I'm just
going<00:01:53.209> to<00:01:53.240> mark<00:01:53.390> with<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.750> marker<00:01:54.229> where<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
going to mark with the marker where the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.139 
going to mark with the marker where the
linkage<00:01:55.759> was<00:01:55.940> in<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.030> I'm

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
linkage was in like that so that I'm

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.760 
linkage was in like that so that I'm
hundred<00:01:59.450> percent<00:01:59.840> sure<00:01:59.929> when<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> put<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.740> back

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
hundred percent sure when I put it back

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.309 
hundred percent sure when I put it back
it's<00:02:01.220> in<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.490> right<00:02:01.610> place<00:02:02.110> now<00:02:03.110> you'll

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
it's in the right place now you'll

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.020 
it's in the right place now you'll
notice<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.039> comb<00:02:04.250> say<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.549> that<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
notice on that the comb say is that the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.809 
notice on that the comb say is that the
fuel<00:02:05.360> line<00:02:05.539> starts<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.259> here<00:02:06.369> works<00:02:07.369> its<00:02:07.610> way

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
fuel line starts over here works its way

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.199 
fuel line starts over here works its way
behind<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.479> little<00:02:08.929> panel<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.060> goes<00:02:11.060> all

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
behind this little panel and goes all

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.620 
behind this little panel and goes all
the<00:02:11.239> way<00:02:11.390> back<00:02:11.480> there<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> fuel<00:02:12.500> tank<00:02:13.630> now

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the way back there to the fuel tank now

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.569 
the way back there to the fuel tank now
sometimes<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.440> fuel<00:02:15.739> line<00:02:15.920> gets<00:02:16.160> hard<00:02:16.459> and

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
sometimes the fuel line gets hard and

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.880 
sometimes the fuel line gets hard and
brittle<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.180> you're<00:02:17.660> able<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.930> just<00:02:18.290> pull<00:02:18.739> it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
brittle and you're able to just pull it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.610 
brittle and you're able to just pull it
out<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.299> if<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.540> fuel<00:02:20.810> line<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.230> stuck

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
out like that if the fuel line is stuck

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.880 
out like that if the fuel line is stuck
to<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> connector<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.230> want<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.350> go<00:02:24.470> with<00:02:24.709> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to the connector you want to go with a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.050 
to the connector you want to go with a
exacto<00:02:25.880> knife<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.299> just<00:02:26.570> put<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:28.060> slit

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
exacto knife and just put a little slit

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.050 
exacto knife and just put a little slit
in<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.310> don't<00:02:31.489> pull<00:02:31.730> off<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
in it so that you don't pull off the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.699 
in it so that you don't pull off the
connector<00:02:32.540> off<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> fuel<00:02:33.049> like<00:02:33.320> I've<00:02:33.500> seen

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
connector off the fuel like I've seen

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.640 
connector off the fuel like I've seen
people<00:02:34.070> pry<00:02:34.459> them<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.450> actually<00:02:35.720> rip<00:02:36.140> off<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
people pry them and actually rip off the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.099 
people pry them and actually rip off the
connector<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.970> bit<00:02:38.690> more<00:02:38.720> difficult

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
connector and it's a bit more difficult

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.289 
connector and it's a bit more difficult
to<00:02:39.470> fix<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.280> start<00:02:40.549> by<00:02:40.700> removing<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
to fix up we can start by removing the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.830 
to fix up we can start by removing the
fuel<00:02:41.540> clip<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.739> still<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> fuel<00:02:43.549> line

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
fuel clip that is still on the fuel line

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.190 
fuel clip that is still on the fuel line
on<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.170> side<00:02:46.150> next<00:02:47.150> I'm<00:02:47.420> just<00:02:47.480> going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.810> pull

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
on this side next I'm just going to pull

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.720 
on this side next I'm just going to pull
on<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.829> fuel<00:02:49.070> line<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.900> out<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:51.730> I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
on the fuel line to get it out so I

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.699 
on the fuel line to get it out so I
managed<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.299> get<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> fuel<00:02:53.750> line<00:02:53.959> out<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.530> in

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
managed to get the fuel line out all in

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.440 
managed to get the fuel line out all in
one<00:02:54.890> piece<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.549> I'm<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.850> use<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.239> as<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
one piece and I'm going to use that as a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.970 
one piece and I'm going to use that as a
template<00:02:57.109> to<00:02:57.350> measure<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.739> my<00:02:57.769> new<00:02:58.310> fuel<00:02:58.579> line

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
template to measure out my new fuel line

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.670 
template to measure out my new fuel line
so<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> fuel<00:03:01.790> line<00:03:01.940> I'm<00:03:02.090> using<00:03:02.680> it's

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
so this is the fuel line I'm using it's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.590 
so this is the fuel line I'm using it's
a<00:03:03.980> made<00:03:04.340> by<00:03:04.489> Goodyear<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.359> quarter

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
a made by Goodyear and it's a quarter

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.110 
a made by Goodyear and it's a quarter
inch<00:03:05.840> inside<00:03:06.440> diameter<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:07.670> don't<00:03:07.850> need<00:03:07.970> to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
inch inside diameter you don't need to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000 
inch inside diameter you don't need to
go<00:03:08.239> buy<00:03:08.359> thomas<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.870> fuel<00:03:09.139> line<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.650> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
go buy thomas a fuel line for that this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.940 
go buy thomas a fuel line for that this
is<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.280> fraction<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> price<00:03:11.389> and<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:12.799> can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
is a fraction of the price and you can

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.899 
is a fraction of the price and you can
buy<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.190> at<00:03:13.310> an<00:03:13.459> autoparts<00:03:13.910> store<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.660> Napa

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
buy it at an autoparts store like Napa

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.399 
buy it at an autoparts store like Napa
so<00:03:16.909> I'm<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.239> start<00:03:17.510> by<00:03:17.690> removing<00:03:18.080> the

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
so I'm going to start by removing the

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.560 
so I'm going to start by removing the
old<00:03:18.500> fuel<00:03:18.890> line<00:03:19.099> from<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.549> fuel

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
old fuel line from the fuel

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.740 
old fuel line from the fuel
removing<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.750> Auklet<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.940> gently<00:03:25.360> turn

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
removing the Auklet then gently turn

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.960 
removing the Auklet then gently turn
make<00:03:26.560> sure<00:03:26.800> it's<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.370> jammed<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.850> it

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
make sure it's not so jammed that it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.540 
make sure it's not so jammed that it
breaks<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.360> fuel<00:03:28.600> valve<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:30.310> I'm<00:03:30.400> going<00:03:30.520> to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
breaks the fuel valve then I'm going to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.370 
breaks the fuel valve then I'm going to
pull<00:03:30.880> out<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:34.060> actually<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.780> tight<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.080> I'm

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
pull out it's actually so tight that I'm

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.780 
pull out it's actually so tight that I'm
going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.560> make<00:03:35.710> a<00:03:35.740> little<00:03:36.070> slit<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.640> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
going to make a little slit with the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
going to make a little slit with the
exacto<00:03:37.270> knife<00:03:41.790> don't<00:03:42.790> go<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.150> too<00:03:43.510> deep

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
exacto knife don't go in too deep

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.630 
exacto knife don't go in too deep
because<00:03:43.960> you<00:03:44.230> don't<00:03:44.380> want<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.620> cut<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.310> fuel

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
because you don't want to cut the fuel

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.210 
because you don't want to cut the fuel
valve<00:03:45.850> connector<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:48.040> just<00:03:48.730> make<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:50.100> turn<00:03:51.100> it

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
valve connector so just make one turn it

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.940 
valve connector so just make one turn it
over<00:03:51.340> make<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> second<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.770> should

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
over make a second one and now it should

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.970 
over make a second one and now it should
come<00:03:57.220> off<00:03:57.370> pretty<00:03:57.580> easy<00:03:59.940> there<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:01.060> go<00:04:01.210> I<00:04:01.980> might

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
come off pretty easy there we go I might

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.800 
come off pretty easy there we go I might
have<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.580> same<00:04:03.730> for<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.150> other<00:04:04.240> one

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.500 

okay<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.410> came<00:04:08.620> off<00:04:09.030> these<00:04:10.030> are<00:04:10.270> fuel

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
okay so this one came off these are fuel

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.960 
okay so this one came off these are fuel
valves<00:04:10.870> here<00:04:11.020> very<00:04:11.440> handy<00:04:11.860> if<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.490> don't<00:04:12.760> have

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
valves here very handy if you don't have

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.330 
valves here very handy if you don't have
one<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.300> your<00:04:13.390> blower<00:04:13.660> now<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.740> good<00:04:14.920> time<00:04:14.980> to

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
one on your blower now is a good time to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.790 
one on your blower now is a good time to
put<00:04:15.550> one<00:04:15.760> on<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:16.540> very<00:04:17.080> good<00:04:17.290> when<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.620> put

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
put one on it's very good when you put

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.520 
put one on it's very good when you put
your<00:04:17.920> machine<00:04:18.220> away<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:19.690> can<00:04:19.840> turn<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.350> fuel

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
your machine away you can turn the fuel

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.730 
your machine away you can turn the fuel
valve<00:04:20.770> off<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.700> burn<00:04:22.570> whatever<00:04:23.140> gas<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.530> left

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
valve off and burn whatever gas is left

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.920 
valve off and burn whatever gas is left
in<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.980> carburetor<00:04:24.540> I'm<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:25.720> going<00:04:25.840> to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
in the carburetor I'm just going to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.470 
in the carburetor I'm just going to
measure<00:04:26.080> out<00:04:26.290> my<00:04:26.320> fuel<00:04:27.070> line<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:31.270> can<00:04:31.450> use

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
measure out my fuel line you can use

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.420 
measure out my fuel line you can use
side<00:04:31.840> cutters<00:04:32.260> too<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.590> cut<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.890> fuel<00:04:33.130> line<00:04:33.280> if

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
side cutters too to cut the fuel line if

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.660 
side cutters too to cut the fuel line if
you<00:04:33.580> prefer<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.810> now<00:04:35.560> for<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.950> long<00:04:36.130> fuel

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
you prefer and now for the long fuel

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.720 
you prefer and now for the long fuel
line<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:41.530> now<00:04:41.830> what<00:04:41.980> you<00:04:42.100> need<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.340> do<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.580> in

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
line so now what you need to do it in

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.170 
line so now what you need to do it in
your<00:04:42.880> fuel<00:04:43.150> line<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.840> insert<00:04:44.260> it<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.680> behind

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
your fuel line is to insert it in behind

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.390 
your fuel line is to insert it in behind
this<00:04:46.180> guard<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.900> run<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.440> all<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.590> way<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
this guard and run it all the way to the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.810 
this guard and run it all the way to the
carburetor<00:04:48.790> over<00:04:49.570> here<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.490> I'm<00:04:51.580> going<00:04:51.760> to

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
carburetor over here so I'm going to

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.330 
carburetor over here so I'm going to
start<00:04:52.090> at<00:04:52.270> this<00:04:52.450> end<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:56.320> goes<00:04:56.530> back<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.130> to

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
start at this end it goes back here to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.500 
start at this end it goes back here to
protect<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.910> fuel<00:04:58.180> line<00:04:58.390> from<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.930> flywheel

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
protect the fuel line from the flywheel

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.660 
protect the fuel line from the flywheel
and<00:05:01.510> there's<00:05:01.870> also<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.260> little<00:05:02.620> guard<00:05:03.400> in

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
and there's also a little guard in

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.620 
and there's also a little guard in
between<00:05:04.210> there<00:05:04.480> here<00:05:05.440> right<00:05:05.860> up<00:05:06.040> top<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.640> the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
between there here right up top and the

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.840 
between there here right up top and the
fuel<00:05:07.900> line<00:05:08.080> has<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.500> go<00:05:08.620> behind<00:05:09.130> that<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:09.580> well

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
fuel line has to go behind that as well

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.520 
fuel line has to go behind that as well
so<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.390> bit<00:05:10.540> tricky<00:05:10.900> you<00:05:10.930> got<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:11.260> run<00:05:11.380> it

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
so it's a bit tricky you got to run it

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.510 
so it's a bit tricky you got to run it
all<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.890> way<00:05:12.010> through<00:05:13.710> if<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:14.980> find<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.340> hard

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
all the way through if you find it hard

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.310 
all the way through if you find it hard
to<00:05:15.580> do<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:16.000> you<00:05:16.210> can<00:05:16.360> use<00:05:16.390> a<00:05:16.510> screwdriver<00:05:16.930> to

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
to do this you can use a screwdriver to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:27.890 
to do this you can use a screwdriver to
push<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.860> back

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.280 

now<00:05:28.900> it's<00:05:29.080> got<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.290> go<00:05:29.380> behind<00:05:29.770> here<00:05:30.900> if<00:05:31.900> it's<00:05:32.170> a

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
now it's got to go behind here if it's a

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.630 
now it's got to go behind here if it's a
motor<00:05:32.500> with<00:05:32.710> points<00:05:33.130> are<00:05:33.250> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.430> have<00:05:33.550> your

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
motor with points are going to have your

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.030 
motor with points are going to have your
spark<00:05:33.970> plug<00:05:34.150> wire<00:05:34.390> here<00:05:34.780> on<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.470> new<00:05:35.620> machines

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
spark plug wire here on the new machines

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.610 
spark plug wire here on the new machines
the<00:05:36.280> coil<00:05:36.550> will<00:05:36.760> be<00:05:36.910> up<00:05:37.030> here<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:38.260> just<00:05:38.500> make

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
the coil will be up here so just make

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.260 
the coil will be up here so just make
sure<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.950> wires<00:05:39.190> out<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.760> way<00:05:39.910> here<00:05:40.150> and

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
sure the wires out of the way here and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.200 
sure the wires out of the way here and
just<00:05:40.840> push<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.200> fuel<00:05:41.440> line<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.940> I'm<00:05:46.030> going<00:05:46.180> to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
just push the fuel line so I'm going to

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.960 
just push the fuel line so I'm going to
put<00:05:46.420> a<00:05:46.450> fuel<00:05:46.840> clip<00:05:47.140> on<00:05:47.380> here<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.610> easier<00:05:48.880> if

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
put a fuel clip on here it's easier if

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.890 
put a fuel clip on here it's easier if
you<00:05:49.060> put<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.390> steel<00:05:49.630> clip<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:50.050> now<00:05:51.450> head<00:05:52.450> put

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
you put the steel clip on now head put

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.430 
you put the steel clip on now head put
it<00:05:52.990> back<00:05:53.230> a<00:05:53.760> little<00:05:54.760> ways<00:05:55.270> so<00:05:55.930> that<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.200> can

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
it back a little ways so that you can

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:13.369 
it back a little ways so that you can
insert<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.950> fuel<00:05:57.190> line<00:05:57.400> on<00:05:57.640> the<00:05:57.940> connector

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.899 

once<00:06:14.379> you've<00:06:14.529> got<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.830> fuel<00:06:15.099> line<00:06:15.249> flush<00:06:15.580> over

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
once you've got the fuel line flush over

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:23.040 
once you've got the fuel line flush over
here<00:06:16.089> just<00:06:16.360> reinsert<00:06:17.169> your<00:06:17.379> fuel<00:06:17.770> clip<00:06:18.009> I<00:06:22.050> want

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
here just reinsert your fuel clip I want

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.749 
here just reinsert your fuel clip I want
to<00:06:23.199> make<00:06:23.349> sure<00:06:23.379> that<00:06:23.710> it's<00:06:23.889> tucked<00:06:24.159> in<00:06:24.400> behind

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
to make sure that it's tucked in behind

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.299 
to make sure that it's tucked in behind
all<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.360> little<00:06:25.599> metal<00:06:25.839> plates<00:06:26.110> as<00:06:26.379> you<00:06:27.129> can
