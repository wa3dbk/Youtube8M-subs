way<00:04:28.370> high<00:04:28.610> up<00:04:29.320> if<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.590> look<00:04:30.830> at<00:04:30.979> this<00:04:31.099> thing

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
way high up if you look at this thing

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.670 
way high up if you look at this thing
which<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.789> you<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.539> very<00:04:32.840> very<00:04:32.960> restrictive

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
which is you know very very restrictive
