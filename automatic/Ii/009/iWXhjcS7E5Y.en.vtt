now<00:00:40.170> we've<00:00:40.559> already<00:00:40.770> did<00:00:41.670> some<00:00:42.149> pre<00:00:42.420> work<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
now we've already did some pre work to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
now we've already did some pre work to
save<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:43.760> what<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
save time what you would do was you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.100 
save time what you would do was you
would<00:00:45.930> flip<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.350> system<00:00:47.129> over<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.110> there's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
would flip this system over and there's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.200 
would flip this system over and there's
six<00:00:49.860> screws<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.090> bottom<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.050> system

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
six screws in the bottom of the system

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.560 
six screws in the bottom of the system
you<00:00:54.210> would<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.570> take<00:00:55.050> those<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
you would actually take those out and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
you would actually take those out and
this<00:00:57.570> will<00:00:57.780> allow<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.829> top<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> system

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this will allow the top of the system

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.280 
this will allow the top of the system
and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> system<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> actually<00:01:01.170> come<00:01:01.350> apart<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
and the system to actually come apart a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.730 
and the system to actually come apart a
lot<00:01:05.119> now<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.540> looking<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:09.740> these

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
lot now what we're looking for is these

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.820 
lot now what we're looking for is these
screws<00:01:11.250> returned<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> camera<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.930> see

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.539 

these<00:01:16.850> flaps<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.240> holding<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.200> hinge<00:01:19.560> we

these flaps are holding in the hinge we

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.730 
these flaps are holding in the hinge we
have<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.080> remove<00:01:22.080> these<00:01:22.320> three<00:01:22.710> screws

possibly this one if you want to be a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
possibly this one if you want to be a
little<00:01:27.540> lazy<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.820> remove

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820

little lazy you don't have to remove
that<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.659> loosen<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that one you can just loosen it a little

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
that one you can just loosen it a little
bit<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.799> screws<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.549> hard<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.180> get

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bit that screws a little hard to get

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
bit that screws a little hard to get
back<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.619> I'll<00:01:35.220> show<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> in

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
back in I'll show you how to do that in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
back in I'll show you how to do that in
a<00:01:36.270> minute<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
a minute but what that does is that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
a minute but what that does is that
removes<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.570> black<00:01:39.930> piece<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.799> holds<00:01:41.189> over

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
removes the black piece that holds over

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.440 
removes the black piece that holds over
the<00:01:41.640> hinge<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.990> we're<00:01:43.439> gonna<00:01:43.530> pause<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.490> we

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the hinge so we're gonna pause as we

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.109 
the hinge so we're gonna pause as we
remove<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:46.649> three<00:01:47.009> screws<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.670> loosen

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
remove these three screws and loosen

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.630 
remove these three screws and loosen
this<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:51.590> okay<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.890> we've<00:01:53.070> done<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this one okay what we've done is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
this one okay what we've done is
loosened<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:58.040> where<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
loosened this one up and where this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.109 
loosened this one up and where this
little<00:01:59.670> flap<00:01:59.960> will<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.530> raise<00:02:02.119> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
little flap will actually raise this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.580 
little flap will actually raise this
because<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
because going to like this is going to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.399 
because going to like this is going to
release<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.430> we've<00:02:06.390> removed<00:02:06.570> these

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
release this and we've removed these

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.650 
release this and we've removed these
three<00:02:07.770> screws<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.700> hinge<00:02:08.970> holder<00:02:09.360> over

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
three screws and the hinge holder over

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.889 
three screws and the hinge holder over
the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.470 
the
or<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> flap<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> hinge<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.269> now

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
or the flap over the hinge so now

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320 
or the flap over the hinge so now
basically<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.640> lift<00:02:15.120> it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
basically all we have to do is lift it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.140 
basically all we have to do is lift it
up<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.019> door<00:02:16.230> comes<00:02:16.560> easily<00:02:17.489> out<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:20.150> we

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
up and the door comes easily out and we

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.759 
up and the door comes easily out and we
just<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.540> repeat<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.349> process<00:02:22.849> or<00:02:24.769> do

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
just have to repeat the process or do

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.910 
just have to repeat the process or do
the<00:02:25.920> process<00:02:26.370> backwards<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.920> basically

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the process backwards and basically

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.539 
the process backwards and basically
we're<00:02:29.519> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.970> stick<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:30.900> hinge<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:32.040> under

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
we're going to stick this hinge up under

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.910 
we're going to stick this hinge up under
the<00:02:32.760> metal<00:02:33.060> flange<00:02:33.569> that's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.709> little

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the metal flange that's a little

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.860 
the metal flange that's a little
difficult<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.940> lot<00:02:36.180> easier<00:02:36.659> than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
difficult but it's a lot easier than

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.940 
difficult but it's a lot easier than
putting<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.290> screw<00:02:37.709> back<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.230> get<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
putting that screw back in so get a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.449 
putting that screw back in so get a
little<00:02:41.220> screwdriver<00:02:42.019> just<00:02:43.019> kind<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.459> maneuver

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
just make sure none of the wires are

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.210 
just make sure none of the wires are
sticking<00:04:01.199> out<00:04:01.319> where<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:01.859> cut<00:04:02.069> your

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
sticking out where you can cut your

sticking out where you can cut your
these<00:04:02.879> are<00:04:03.090> wired<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.660> harnesses<00:04:04.199> for<00:04:04.500> your

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
these are wired and harnesses for your

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.460 
these are wired and harnesses for your
control<00:04:05.430> port<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.000> if<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.329> match<00:04:06.599> those<00:04:06.989> and

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
control port so if you match those and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.680 
control port so if you match those and
cut<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.129> wire<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.430> could<00:04:09.150> lose<00:04:09.359> your<00:04:09.510> control

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
cut a wire you could lose your control

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.199 
cut a wire you could lose your control
port<00:04:10.139> but<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:10.859> hardly<00:04:11.220> ever<00:04:11.400> happens<00:04:11.519> just

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
port but that hardly ever happens just

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.539 
port but that hardly ever happens just
make<00:04:12.359> sure<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.660> wires<00:04:12.870> are<00:04:13.109> down<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.650> that's

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
make sure the wires are down and that's

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.789 
make sure the wires are down and that's
it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.300 

as<00:04:21.240> you<00:04:22.240> can<00:04:22.360> see<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.440> door<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.740> back

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
as you can see that the door is back

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.659 
as you can see that the door is back
young<00:04:24.639> in<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.660> correct<00:04:26.169> position<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.800> it

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
young in the correct position and it

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.990 
young in the correct position and it
works<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.150> charm<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:29.949> couple<00:04:30.849> little

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
matches the color as long as it's not

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.219 
matches the color as long as it's not
faded<00:04:41.310> see<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.490> color<00:04:42.699> difference<00:04:42.960> but<00:04:43.960> if

you see the original color it matches

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.719 
you see the original color it matches
pretty<00:04:47.289> close<00:04:48.840> one<00:04:49.840> thing<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.169> can<00:04:50.349> do<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.800> you
