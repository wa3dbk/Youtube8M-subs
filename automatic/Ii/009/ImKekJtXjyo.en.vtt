00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
we are going to be doing a tutorial on

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.670 
we are going to be doing a tutorial on
that<00:00:05.879> tree<00:00:06.569> over<00:00:07.140> there

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
that tree over there

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.299 
that tree over there
so<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:09.300> dead<00:00:09.750> dying<00:00:11.480> tree<00:00:12.769> alright<00:00:13.769> so

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
so the like dead dying tree alright so

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.910 
so the like dead dying tree alright so
what<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.150> first<00:00:15.599> want<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> actually

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
what we first want to do is actually

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.310 
what we first want to do is actually
want<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> find<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.580> area<00:00:17.880> first<00:00:18.359> let's<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
want to find an area first let's do it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.420 
want to find an area first let's do it
right<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.840> want<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> start<00:00:22.529> off<00:00:23.070> by

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
right here we first want to start off by

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
right here we first want to start off by
building<00:00:23.930> how<00:00:25.039> tall<00:00:26.869> half<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.529> tree<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:29.010> be

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
building how tall half the tree will be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.730 
building how tall half the tree will be
so<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.500> halfway

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so like this will be like the halfway

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.190 
so like this will be like the halfway
height<00:00:33.950> that<00:00:34.950> looks<00:00:35.160> pretty<00:00:35.640> good<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.239> don't<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
height that looks pretty good I don't I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
height that looks pretty good I don't I
made<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.570> makes<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> once<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
made that one and it makes that once you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.549 
made that one and it makes that once you
talk<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> add<00:00:42.960> some<00:00:43.230> roots

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
talk so now we want to add some roots

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
talk so now we want to add some roots
that<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:45.620> around<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.460> bottom<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that go out from around the bottom of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.010 
that go out from around the bottom of
the<00:00:48.239> tree<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the tree and you can do this and just

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
the tree and you can do this and just
put<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.350> randomly<00:00:53.270> like<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.309> now<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
put them randomly like so now what you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.990 
put them randomly like so now what you
want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.660> branches<00:00:59.840> like<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
want to do is the branches like this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
want to do is the branches like this
that's<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.270> branch<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.840> pig<00:01:04.409> yeah

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that's one branch that's a pig yeah

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's one branch that's a pig yeah
pretty<00:01:05.430> big<00:01:05.580> branch<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
pretty big branch so actually got a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.390 
pretty big branch so actually got a
shorten<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> one<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:10.400> looks

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
shorten that one up a bit that looks

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.600 
shorten that one up a bit that looks
better<00:01:11.720> I<00:01:12.860> had<00:01:13.860> another<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:15.710> like<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
better I had another one here like that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.810 
better I had another one here like that
actually<00:01:18.259> what<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> also<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.310> make

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
actually what you also can do is make

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually what you also can do is make
them<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.720> diagonal<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> we'll

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
them go diagonal like so so we'll

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
them go diagonal like so so we'll
actually<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:27.950> move<00:01:29.090> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
actually do that just to move or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.609 
actually do that just to move or
actually<00:01:30.540> make<00:01:31.020> some<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> them<00:01:31.439> look

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
actually make some of them look

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.530 
actually make some of them look
different<00:01:32.270> they're<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> straight

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
different they're not all just straight

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.390 
different they're not all just straight
and<00:01:36.540> we'll<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.200> taller<00:01:37.650> ones<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and we'll make some taller ones and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
and we'll make some taller ones and
we'll<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.450> shorter<00:01:39.930> ones<00:01:41.479> we<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we'll make some shorter ones we can get

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.810 
we'll make some shorter ones we can get
rid<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> these<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:45.170> here<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.530> one

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
rid of some of these here here that one

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.770 
rid of some of these here here that one
actually<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.210> doesn't<00:01:48.390> look<00:01:48.509> good

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.389 

mmm<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> leave<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> hollow<00:01:52.890> inside<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
mmm I will just leave a hollow inside I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.289 
mmm I will just leave a hollow inside I
guess

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.249 

we'll<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:58.219> no<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.490> looks<00:01:59.670> good<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.020> then

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
we'll get a no that looks good and then

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
we'll get a no that looks good and then
we'll<00:02:01.409> put<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.950> more<00:02:02.219> over<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:08.840> alright

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we'll put one more over here alright

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.059 
we'll put one more over here alright
that<00:02:10.019> looks<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.440> bad<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> get

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
that looks really bad like that I get

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.990 
that looks really bad like that I get
too<00:02:17.069> tall

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
too tall

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240 
too tall

alright like that and we'll get rid of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460 
alright like that and we'll get rid of
some<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.580> these<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.450> what<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.170> is

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
get rid of the white faces so just go

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.229 
get rid of the white faces so just go
along<00:02:26.819> through<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.670> leave<00:02:29.970> some<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
along through here you can leave some of

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.400 
along through here you can leave some of
them<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:31.079> don't<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.440> bad<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.250> um<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:34.200> most

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
them they don't look bad but um the most

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.080 
them they don't look bad but um the most
part<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.829> want<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.220> rid<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
part you want to get rid of a lot of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.650 
part you want to get rid of a lot of
them<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:40.049> stick<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.069> branches<00:02:41.660> downwards

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
them and stick the branches downwards

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.680 
them and stick the branches downwards
like<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:44.989> we'll<00:02:45.989> leave<00:02:46.260> some<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.709> these<00:02:47.690> or

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:10.040 
that one in that one and that one and
we'll<00:02:54.360> get<00:02:55.049> rid<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:57.629> one

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.820 

once<00:03:10.740> we<00:03:10.890> add<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> couple<00:03:11.700> back<00:03:12.000> here<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:13.740> so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
once we add a couple back here just so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.300 
once we add a couple back here just so
it<00:03:13.950> doesn't<00:03:14.010> look<00:03:14.250> too<00:03:14.370> boring<00:03:15.470> give<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.650> that

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
it doesn't look too boring give it that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.750 
it doesn't look too boring give it that
one<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> guess<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> there<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.460> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
one I guess and there you go there is a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.120 
one I guess and there you go there is a
dead<00:03:24.540> slash<00:03:25.320> dying

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
dead slash dying

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.760 
dead slash dying
whatever<00:03:26.820> tree<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.900> these<00:03:31.140> they

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
whatever tree I really like these they

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.550 
whatever tree I really like these they
kind<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.670> dark<00:03:33.270> feeling<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.410> them

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
kind of have like a dark feeling to them

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.060 
kind of have like a dark feeling to them
since<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.820> no<00:03:36.590> life<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.830> them<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
since they have no life on them and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.710 
since they have no life on them and
maybe<00:03:41.070> I'll<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.370> some<00:03:41.580> more<00:03:41.610> tree<00:03:42.000> tutorials<00:03:42.570> I

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
maybe I'll do some more tree tutorials I

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.620 
maybe I'll do some more tree tutorials I
have<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.870> pine<00:03:43.470> tree<00:03:43.730> one<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.970> I'd<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.480> do

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
have a pine tree one that I'd like to do

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.010 
have a pine tree one that I'd like to do
and<00:03:46.190> eventually<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.220> want<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.790> um<00:03:48.210> cherry

blossom trees I want to learn how to

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.620 
blossom trees I want to learn how to
make<00:03:50.760> those<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.050> maybe<00:03:52.500> we<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:52.980> a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
make those so maybe we can do like a

let's build tree series actually won't

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.120 
let's build tree series actually won't
be<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.960> series<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.800> one<00:03:59.010> episode

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
be a series it just be like one episode

and<00:03:59.640> we<00:03:59.700> try<00:03:59.880> and<00:03:59.970> build<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.210> cherry<00:04:00.450> blossom

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
and we try and build a cherry blossom

and we try and build a cherry blossom
for<00:04:00.960> me<00:04:01.020> because<00:04:01.800> that'd<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.160> pretty<00:04:02.460> hard<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
for me because that'd be pretty hard I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.190 
for me because that'd be pretty hard I
think<00:04:03.030> so
