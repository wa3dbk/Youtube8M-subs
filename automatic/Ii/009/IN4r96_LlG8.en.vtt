00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
are making a breadsticks so what I am

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
are making a breadsticks so what I am
doing<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.260> am<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.740> make<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.980> slurry<00:02:33.460> out

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
the sticks this is our bread slice so we

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.010 
the sticks this is our bread slice so we
need<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.440> make<00:03:50.650> our<00:03:50.890> bread<00:03:51.550> sticks<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.780> what<00:03:52.990> I

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
need to make our bread sticks so what I

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.070 
need to make our bread sticks so what I
am<00:03:53.170> going<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.560> do<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.770> take<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.050> cut<00:03:56.050> it
