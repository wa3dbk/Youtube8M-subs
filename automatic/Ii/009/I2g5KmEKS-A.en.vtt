00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.400 
good job in the movie and gave the best
performance<00:04:54.090> he<00:04:54.690> was<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> only<00:04:55.080> character

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
performance he was the only character

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.100 
performance he was the only character
that<00:04:55.920> wasn't<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.400> complete<00:04:56.970> imbecile<00:04:57.510> another

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
that wasn't a complete imbecile another

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.300 
that wasn't a complete imbecile another
thing<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:58.350> really<00:04:58.590> did<00:04:58.710> not<00:04:58.830> like<00:04:58.890> about<00:04:59.220> this

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
thing I really did not like about this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.280 
thing I really did not like about this
movie<00:04:59.610> is<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.940> it's<00:05:00.090> directed<00:05:00.600> extremely

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
movie is that it's directed extremely

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.010 
movie is that it's directed extremely
lazily<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:02.160> large<00:05:02.580> majority<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.690> scenes

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
lazily a large majority of the scenes

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.500 
lazily a large majority of the scenes
are<00:05:04.320> filled<00:05:04.710> with<00:05:04.830> close-ups<00:05:05.670> like<00:05:06.000> every

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
are filled with close-ups like every

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.480 
are filled with close-ups like every
scene<00:05:06.900> where<00:05:07.320> a<00:05:07.380> character<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.860> talking<00:05:08.370> it's

almost always a close-up close-ups are

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.280 
almost always a close-up close-ups are
not<00:05:11.040> used<00:05:11.280> effectively<00:05:11.640> in<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.240> movie<00:05:12.540> also

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290

in on people as they walk because that's

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.960 
in on people as they walk because that's
a<00:05:21.900> very<00:05:22.110> simple<00:05:22.620> way<00:05:22.920> to<00:05:22.980> not<00:05:23.310> have<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.580> do<00:05:23.730> much

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970
