strategy and I feel like we could go

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.920 
strategy and I feel like we could go
pretty<00:00:38.350> far<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.360> just<00:00:40.690> wanted<00:00:40.899> to

good<00:00:47.530> communication<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:48.550> definitely<00:00:49.359> key<00:00:49.690> in

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
good communication is definitely key in

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.069 
good communication is definitely key in
this<00:00:49.960> game<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.469> do<00:00:50.559> not<00:00:50.800> think<00:00:50.859> that<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.460> can

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
this game I do not think that you can

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.479 
this game I do not think that you can
seriously<00:00:53.079> get<00:00:53.260> far<00:00:53.590> without<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:53.980> four-man

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
seriously get far without a four-man

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.420 
seriously get far without a four-man
team<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.120> a<00:00:55.480> four-man<00:00:55.899> team<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.440> can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
team and a four-man team that can

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.369 
team and a four-man team that can
communicate<00:00:57.640> what's<00:00:58.329> going<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.140> also

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
communicate what's going on and also

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.450 
communicate what's going on and also
shake<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.070> bake<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:02.469> very<00:01:02.800> important<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> do

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
shake and bake very very important to do

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.789 
shake and bake very very important to do
that<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:04.239> think<00:01:04.659> it's<00:01:05.019> kind<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.259> hard<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.590> do

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
that I think it's kind of hard to do

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.499 
that I think it's kind of hard to do
that<00:01:05.830> when<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.220> randomly<00:01:06.460> match<00:01:06.909> up<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:07.240> people

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
that when you randomly match up a people

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.929 
that when you randomly match up a people
online<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.770> very<00:01:08.890> hit<00:01:09.280> or<00:01:09.310> miss<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.759> lot<00:01:09.880> of

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
online that's very hit or miss a lot of

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.399 
online that's very hit or miss a lot of
times<00:01:10.210> you'll<00:01:10.450> get<00:01:10.600> people<00:01:10.869> who<00:01:10.990> don't<00:01:11.320> have

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
times you'll get people who don't have

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.310 
times you'll get people who don't have
mics<00:01:11.710> or<00:01:12.070> don't<00:01:12.580> communicate<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.720> you

team<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:38.989> keep<00:03:39.440> moving<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.190> think<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.519> lot<00:03:40.640> of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
team to keep moving I think a lot of

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.370 
team to keep moving I think a lot of
people<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:41.030> think<00:03:41.360> oh<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.019> hold<00:03:42.170> down

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
people just think oh if we can hold down

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.320 
people just think oh if we can hold down
a<00:03:42.410> room<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.190> good<00:03:43.459> vantage<00:03:43.700> point<00:03:44.209> or

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
a room and get a good vantage point or

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.449 
a room and get a good vantage point or
whatever<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:45.260> that's<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.860> best<00:03:46.040> way<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.250> do

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
whatever that that's the best way to do

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.310 
whatever that that's the best way to do
it<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.850> disagree<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.630> think<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.049> best<00:03:48.200> way

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
it and I disagree I think the best way

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.440 
it and I disagree I think the best way
is<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.680> keep<00:03:48.980> running<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.850> stay<00:03:50.180> on<00:03:50.299> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
is to just keep running and stay on the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.810 
is to just keep running and stay on the
move<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:51.290> think<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.070> game<00:03:52.220> almost<00:03:52.459> kind<00:03:52.730> of

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
move I think the game almost kind of

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.090 
move I think the game almost kind of
forces<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.420> do<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:54.920> kind

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
forces you to do that and this is kind

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.220 
forces you to do that and this is kind
of<00:03:55.130> where<00:03:55.310> like<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.880> good<00:03:56.209> communication<00:03:56.840> comes

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
of where like a good communication comes

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.080 
of where like a good communication comes
in<00:03:57.380> key<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:58.370> your<00:03:58.519> team<00:03:58.730> does<00:03:58.910> not

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
in key because if your team does not

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.350 
in key because if your team does not
move<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.750> unit<00:04:00.760> progressively<00:04:01.760> forward

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
move as a unit progressively forward

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.870 
move as a unit progressively forward
you'll<00:04:03.140> just<00:04:03.350> get<00:04:03.470> trapped<00:04:03.799> because<00:04:04.250> dombey's

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you'll just get trapped because dombey's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.130 
you'll just get trapped because dombey's
will<00:04:05.000> start<00:04:05.180> coming<00:04:05.299> in<00:04:05.570> at<00:04:05.690> every<00:04:05.959> direction

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
will start coming in at every direction

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.050 
will start coming in at every direction
and<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:07.070> know<00:04:07.190> if<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.459> sit<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.910> room

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and you know if you just sit in a room

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.449 
and you know if you just sit in a room
for<00:04:08.299> too<00:04:08.450> long<00:04:08.630> you're<00:04:09.560> you're<00:04:09.950> pretty<00:04:10.400> much
