00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.299
 superstar super mario bros 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.450

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.110

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.640
 we have a total of 6 levels with 4 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.320
 houses 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.660
 I do not know how I will do it if the levels of the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.160
 younger to the eye I make them two in 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.210
 two or one at a time I have no idea 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.250
 because I do not have the slightest or remote 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.169
 idea of how long each mission lasts so 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.899
 each of them has three coins 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.290
 stars path superstar one a 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.320
 classic vertigo travel we go for 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.320
 there 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.180

 two hundred and fifty coins of all 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.000
 game in the campaign is to say the three 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.289
 coins found in the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.590
 different levels of the campaign we're going 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120
 there 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.899
 I hate these screens 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.899
 but good 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.900
 let's see what we have because the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.520
 levels of the worlds and stars are usually 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.520
 be more difficult than usual 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.790
 what a lot for dad there has been 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.790

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.120
 there we have the first coin a lot 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.120
 be careful with this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.049
 and almost died at the beginning 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.049
 but I have managed to do well 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.800

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.600
 castellÃ³n 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.420

 but for dad pam pam who chews 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.260
 and this level improves a bit because there's 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.710
 one very similar in a super tlc 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.390
 mario bros 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.660
 2 if you have to run and give the buttons 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.660
 true 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.980
 m 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.200
 at my age 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.640
 I say the penguin is 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.380
 and because they put you in the area 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.540
 superstar gave and do not promise in the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.880
 game well more 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.300
 and well let's see this level paints 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.300
 vintage a script 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.590
 my mother this 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.060
 this as pint 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.060
 Let's see 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580
 Right 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.350
 of miracle kid does not give me time or 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.830
 react 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.830
 or 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.720
 oyster lad 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400
 vega 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.250
 my mother was moon 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.910
 a hunter what level 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.089
 Look 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.570
 and forgive guys there's been a cut 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.120
 in the video but it is that I have stopped 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.190
 the recording of the voice and I do not know what 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.139
 noses has happened so nothing are we going to 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.490
 give him 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.110
 and now what happens how are we the level 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.840
 I do not know where the cut was from because it's 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.960
 what has happened to me without practically giving me 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.960
 account 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.050
 let's do this level 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.220
 Y 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.220
 or not 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.570
 come on 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.790
 this is practically done like this 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.790
 like the currency 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.740
 and we have it and we reach the flag and 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.740
 there we are 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.260
 mario time and good guys, I'm going to do it 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.700
 two by two because this level marked the 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.440
 truth is that the recording of the 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.790
 video would last longer but as I have been 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.930
 cut the audio there will be a cut and 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.910
 will be somewhat shorter than in 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.380
 reality has been but good guys is 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.970
 here the levels of the star path 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.780
 let's take advantage of the sea run and run 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.000
 the next level 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.560
 u and not so that is not the next level 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.550
 would be 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.290
 a dip with chips are crawling like that 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.080
 that was guys there is the penguin and the 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.090
 coastal hat there you have it look 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.630
 the objects there we have the hat with 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.520
 of those who 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.320
 I find it curious that they got into 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.250
 the path stars and graphics so we 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.930
 we see in the next video I have 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.610
 liked do not say value the video there 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.850
 favorites comment videos and see you later 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.850
 bye
