00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.710
 hello how about I only 600 welcome to 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.300
 a new video in which I'm going to 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.160
 teach a little robot that I got myself 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.420
 online which I found very useful 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.880
 to show you how far you can 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.040
 arrive with versions 1.8 as you know 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.779
 to version 1.8 they bring different 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.160
 new objects and apart from that too 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.410
 the united command for example of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.600
 copy and paste ok and well this is not 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.490
 all these artifacts not that brings by 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.410
 example brings a new coat rack that 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.030
 coat rack makes skeleton 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.160
 of the robot and apart from this the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.800
 head ok and good as you can see this 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.270
 It will be the little bag and I simply is 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 pressing a button I can make the 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.230
 robot walk break blocks walk according to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.250
 what would be the address of the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.840
 repeaters 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.190
 the robot walk in this case I say that 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.899
 Break this block then on the way to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 up after I walk to the right 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.649
 then to the left to break block 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.269
 and finally it reaches the same place ok 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.190
 well I'm going to spend on Tuesday 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.310
 they are simply going to grab what would be 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.930
 this block this this sign is going to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.360
 break and they will place what would be a 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.170
 block a block of rest 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.820
 automatically the theft will start to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.070
 work as you can see according to and so 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.390
 as wow ok it is way that is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.280
 running and it's essentially 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.840
 press this little button and the theft goes to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.580
 be the telephone circuit in this 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.080
 case from chiquitito 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.790
 can see the blush breaks what would be 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.830
 the block then quoted to walk towards 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 forward is going to walk now what would be 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.720
 this repeater and then to walk 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.700
 again to what would be the other 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.290
 repeater if you get an enemy to the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.730
 front and will kill him with a sword to 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.620
 see is pretty cuchi 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.330
 ok and finally it's going to get to what 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.040
 would this plan to restrict 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.080
 symbolizes what where is going to stay at 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.790
 robot and good as the one that works this 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.410
 robbery will ask me what this robbery 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.420
 it works with copy animations and 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.730
 They stick in this case made this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.680
 way let's show them everything you can see 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.330
 what the command is blocked by the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.770
 reston stay like this this means that 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.080
 activating and deactivating what would be 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.910
 that good command we're going to see how 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 is that this works simply for 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.780
 one step of the robot is going to be what it would be 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.850
 seven steps in this case give the first 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.280
 the second the third the fourth the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.530
 fifth the sixth and the seventh ok as 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.910
 can see each step is a is a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.680
 different animation that the robot does not 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.690
 can see this area next animation 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.430
 of stay and so it is achieved that it is done 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.840
 that robbery good now I want to talk to you 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 it would be a little burning as 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.320
 they are around here and it turns out that 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.910
 it happens that I already went on vacation or that 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.310
 I'm completely vacation right now 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.480
 doing nothing therefore we wanted 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.950
 I wanted to ask to see if they want a 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.930
 series that would be three times a week 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
 that there is monday tuesday wednesday so that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.530
 the channel does not have a series and you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.270
 you lose a little more I teach them 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
 little bit more apart I think it would be a 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.260
 world survival the series would be sign 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.720
 completely and would be what would be the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 in the code of 1.8 and well this will be 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.200
 completely everything I want them 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.950
 say I hope you liked it 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.599
 I have served you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.050
 subscribe law favorites and we do not see a 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.050
 next occasion
