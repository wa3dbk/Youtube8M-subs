am using aim assist and that's primarily

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.930 
am using aim assist and that's primarily
because<00:02:15.800> i'm<00:02:16.100> still<00:02:16.280> getting<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.550> parents

get rid of aim assist and that usually

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.540 
get rid of aim assist and that usually
takes<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.600> while<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.989> need<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> discover<00:02:30.890> what

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
takes a while I need to discover what

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.040

but<00:02:33.290> I'm<00:02:33.650> using<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.070> default<00:02:34.220> right<00:02:34.610> now<00:02:34.730> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
but I'm using the default right now and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.059 
but I'm using the default right now and
they<00:02:35.000> seem<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.209> be<00:02:35.390> working<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.720> fine

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
they seem to be working just fine

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.380 
they seem to be working just fine
hopefully<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.190> customize<00:02:37.670> them<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.269> my

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390

hopefully I can customize them to my
liking<00:02:38.660> soon<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.300> said<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.840> think

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
certainly feels a lot better a lot

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.990 
certainly feels a lot better a lot
smoother<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.290> lot<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.620> controlled<00:02:49.040> than<00:02:49.250> it

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
smoother a lot more controlled than it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.199
