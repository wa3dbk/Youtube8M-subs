specific Vox clean tone that's the sort

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.940 
specific Vox clean tone that's the sort

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
that this amp does very well and at low

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.280 
that this amp does very well and at low
volumes<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.960> very<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:47.070> cost<00:03:47.630> it's<00:03:48.630> got

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
speaker in here and it's so the speaker

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.120 
speaker in here and it's so the speaker

different<00:03:59.490> wattage<00:03:59.820> levels<00:04:00.650> we've<00:04:01.650> got<00:04:01.860> our

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
different wattage levels we've got our

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.160 
different wattage levels we've got our
volume<00:04:02.459> up<00:04:02.610> only<00:04:03.030> about<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.330> third<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.080> way

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
volume up only about a third of the way

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.420 
volume up only about a third of the way
even<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.500> little<00:04:04.650> bit<00:04:04.830> less<00:04:04.980> than<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.190> third<00:04:05.400> of

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
even a little bit less than a third of

even a little bit less than a third of
the<00:04:05.580> way<00:04:05.730> here<00:04:06.380> let's<00:04:07.380> switch<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.520> lower

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
the way here let's switch to a lower

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.910 
the way here let's switch to a lower
wattage<00:04:09.240> let's<00:04:09.630> switch<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.110> one<00:04:10.500> watt<00:04:10.709> and

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
wattage let's switch to one watt and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.980 
wattage let's switch to one watt and
crank<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.610> volume<00:04:11.640> up<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.300> little<00:04:12.480> bit<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.840> this

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
crank the volume up a little bit on this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.500 
crank the volume up a little bit on this
guy<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.920> now<00:04:14.010> we've<00:04:14.130> got<00:04:14.310> our<00:04:14.340> volume<00:04:14.880> up<00:04:15.060> about

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
guy so now we've got our volume up about

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.640 
guy so now we've got our volume up about
half<00:04:15.810> way

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
half way

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.039 
half way
although<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.400> output<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:18.000> similar<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.600> know

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
although the output is similar you know

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.659 
although the output is similar you know
the<00:04:19.200> perceived<00:04:19.790> output<00:04:20.790> level<00:04:21.540> is<00:04:21.630> similar<00:04:22.080> to

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the perceived output level is similar to

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.400 
the perceived output level is similar to
what<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:23.790> were<00:04:24.000> running<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:24.570> four<00:04:24.870> watts<00:04:25.140> so

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
what we were running at four watts so

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:35.040 
what we were running at four watts so
now<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:25.950> get<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.160> lot<00:04:26.280> more<00:04:26.340> Distortion

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.379 

you<00:04:35.680> get<00:04:35.830> some<00:04:35.979> more<00:04:36.129> modern<00:04:36.520> like<00:04:36.699> pop<00:04:37.090> rock

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
you get some more modern like pop rock

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.200 
you get some more modern like pop rock
rhythm<00:04:37.659> tones<00:04:38.159> some<00:04:39.159> good<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.610> alternative

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
rhythm tones some good like alternative

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:58.309 
rhythm tones some good like alternative
rock<00:04:40.270> tones

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.290 

even<00:04:59.009> if<00:04:59.129> this<00:04:59.249> saturation<00:04:59.669> level<00:05:00.029> still

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
even if this saturation level still

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.299 
even if this saturation level still
responds<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.499> sounds<00:05:01.710> very<00:05:01.800> different<00:05:02.099> with

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:02.309 
responds it sounds very different with

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:17.140 
responds it sounds very different with
their<00:05:02.520> different<00:05:03.029> pickup<00:05:03.330> settings

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:40.350 

and<00:05:17.690> was<00:05:17.810> rhythm<00:05:18.050> let's<00:05:18.229> go<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.380> trouble

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.410 

let's<00:05:41.020> go<00:05:41.290> to<00:05:41.350> 1<00:05:42.160> watt<00:05:42.370> mode<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.880> crank<00:05:43.270> the

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
let's go to 1 watt mode and crank the

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.840 
let's go to 1 watt mode and crank the
volume<00:05:43.450> all<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:43.990> way<00:05:44.110> up<00:05:44.490> now<00:05:45.490> we've<00:05:45.640> got<00:05:45.760> our

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
volume all the way up now we've got our

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.460 
volume all the way up now we've got our
volume<00:05:46.270> which<00:05:46.390> is<00:05:46.420> really<00:05:46.660> our<00:05:46.690> gain<00:05:47.020> control

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
volume which is really our gain control

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.420 
volume which is really our gain control
dimed<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.660> we<00:05:49.660> still<00:05:50.350> are<00:05:50.590> at<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.800> relatively

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
dimed and we still are at a relatively

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.060 
dimed and we still are at a relatively
the<00:05:51.550> same<00:05:51.670> output<00:05:52.150> level<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:53.800> we<00:05:53.920> were

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
the same output level that we were

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.680 
the same output level that we were
before<00:05:54.280> but<00:05:54.760> now<00:05:54.910> we<00:05:54.970> have<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.300> lot<00:05:55.660> more

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
before but now we have a lot more

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.630 
before but now we have a lot more
saturation<00:05:56.410> and<00:05:56.560> this<00:05:56.710> is<00:05:56.860> basically<00:05:57.400> the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
saturation and this is basically the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.910 
saturation and this is basically the
most<00:05:57.900> saturation<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.020> amp<00:05:59.230> can<00:05:59.440> do<00:05:59.590> with<00:05:59.770> a

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
most saturation this amp can do with a

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.090 
most saturation this amp can do with a
humbucker<00:06:00.930> that's<00:06:01.930> cranked<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.680> vom<00:06:02.860> the

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
humbucker that's cranked the vom the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:26.820 
humbucker that's cranked the vom the
gain<00:06:03.640> control<00:06:04.030> here<00:06:04.180> is<00:06:04.270> cranked

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.929 

so<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:27.889> can<00:06:27.979> hear<00:06:28.099> this<00:06:28.219> amp<00:06:28.370> don't<00:06:28.550> really<00:06:28.759> do

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
so you can hear this amp don't really do

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.360 
so you can hear this amp don't really do
that<00:06:29.120> sort<00:06:29.330> of<00:06:29.419> like<00:06:29.509> palm-muted<00:06:30.250> you<00:06:31.250> know

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
that sort of like palm-muted you know

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.820 
that sort of like palm-muted you know
metal<00:06:31.789> like<00:06:32.180> thrash<00:06:32.629> kind<00:06:33.199> of<00:06:33.319> tone<00:06:33.530> but

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
metal like thrash kind of tone but

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.959 
metal like thrash kind of tone but
that's<00:06:33.979> not<00:06:34.099> really<00:06:34.310> what<00:06:34.430> it's<00:06:34.550> suited<00:06:34.789> for

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
that's not really what it's suited for

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.730 
that's not really what it's suited for
and<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.509> still<00:06:35.659> does<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.840> ton<00:06:36.289> of<00:06:36.319> other<00:06:36.650> stuff

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
and it still does a ton of other stuff
