so that's pretty damn good for having

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.810 
so that's pretty damn good for having
the<00:02:27.090> stock<00:02:27.330> head<00:02:27.540> unit<00:02:28.489> unless<00:02:29.489> we're<00:02:29.700> gonna

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the stock head unit unless we're gonna

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.070 
the stock head unit unless we're gonna
do<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.239> testing<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.660> figure<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:30.959> if

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
do some more testing and figure out if

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.430 
do some more testing and figure out if
we<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.440> any<00:02:31.560> more<00:02:31.590> DPS<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> it
