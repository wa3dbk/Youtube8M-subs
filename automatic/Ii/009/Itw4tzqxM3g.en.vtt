dye I did a reaction video on this about
a<00:00:14.910> year<00:00:15.269> ago<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.599> when<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.379> time<00:00:16.650> I'd

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
a year ago and when the first time I'd

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
a year ago and when the first time I'd
used<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.330> I've<00:00:18.449> been<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.109> my

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

main<00:00:19.350> hair<00:00:19.980> dye<00:00:20.130> since<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> thought

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
main hair dye since then so I thought

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
main hair dye since then so I thought
I'd<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> an<00:00:22.260> updated<00:00:22.560> video<00:00:22.800> because

darkest red they do and I use the dark

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920 
darkest red they do and I use the dark
one<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.040> fade<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.940> sort

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
one because then it will fade and sort

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
one because then it will fade and sort
of<00:00:46.020> I'll<00:00:46.260> say<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.829> dark<00:00:47.070> red<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> light

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
of I'll say from a dark red to a light

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
of I'll say from a dark red to a light
red<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:47.940> through<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.440> quite<00:00:49.950> quite

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
red and through but they do quite quite

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240 
red and through but they do quite quite
a<00:00:50.640> range<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.210> colors<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.890> directions<00:00:52.890> might

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a range of colors like directions might

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.319 
a range of colors like directions might
panic<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> thing

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
panic that kind of thing

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.830 
panic that kind of thing
maybe<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.750> two<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.800> three<00:00:55.829> Reds<00:00:56.399> add<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
maybe do two or three Reds add or do I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
maybe do two or three Reds add or do I
think<00:00:58.289> seven<00:00:58.859> or<00:00:58.920> eight<00:00:59.100> types<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.820> red<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.359> RN

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think seven or eight types of red and RN

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.250 
think seven or eight types of red and RN
which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> sort<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> tones<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:03.019> but<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
which is sort of tones and but this is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
which is sort of tones and but this is
the<00:01:04.379> darkest<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.890> I've<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.790> milord

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the darkest one I've got some milord

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.260 
the darkest one I've got some milord
there<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.650> blood<00:01:08.010> red<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
there you can see it a blood red and it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.550 
there you can see it a blood red and it
does<00:01:09.420> come<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> blood<00:01:09.960> red<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.380> believe

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
does come out a blood red don't believe

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
does come out a blood red don't believe
the<00:01:10.680> swatches<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> shop<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the swatches if you go to the shop and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.880 
the swatches if you go to the shop and
they've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.390> swatches<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.380> think

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they've got swatches on this I think

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
they've got swatches on this I think
this<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.220> looks<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> dark<00:01:14.850> copper<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this one looks like a dark copper a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.859 
this one looks like a dark copper a
ginger<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.799> blood-red<00:01:17.689> I'll<00:01:18.689> put

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
ginger it's actually blood-red I'll put

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
ginger it's actually blood-red I'll put
a<00:01:18.900> picture<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.979> how<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> looks

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
a picture here so that's how it looks

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.859 
a picture here so that's how it looks
when<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.090> dyed<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> comes<00:01:27.689> out

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
when it's first dyed and so it comes out

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.010 
when it's first dyed and so it comes out
a<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.229> nice<00:01:28.439> dark<00:01:29.189> blood<00:01:30.060> turned<00:01:30.630> red

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a really nice dark blood turned red

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
a really nice dark blood turned red
which<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> very<00:01:31.680> difficult<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> find<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.579> hair

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
which is very difficult to find in hair

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.010 
which is very difficult to find in hair
dyes<00:01:32.970> these<00:01:33.180> days<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
dyes these days which is one of the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.350 
dyes these days which is one of the
reasons<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
reasons I like it the other is that it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.469 
reasons I like it the other is that it
fades<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.890> well<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
fades really really well and it's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.260 
fades really really well and it's
difficult<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.729> webcam<00:01:41.939> my

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
difficult for you to see on my webcam my

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.929 
difficult for you to see on my webcam my
webcam<00:01:42.600> doesn't<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.110> colors<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.939> but

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
webcam doesn't do colors very well but

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
webcam doesn't do colors very well but
I've<00:01:45.060> given<00:01:45.270> I'm<00:01:45.600> sat<00:01:45.960> next<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> window<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I've given I'm sat next to the window so

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.499 
I've given I'm sat next to the window so
there's<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.430> natural<00:01:48.030> light<00:01:48.299> as

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
there's as much natural light as

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.630

actually<00:02:20.140> faded<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> lot<00:02:20.739> more<00:02:20.920> than<00:02:21.099> it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
actually faded a lot more than it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.559 
actually faded a lot more than it
normally<00:02:21.370> within<00:02:21.760> those<00:02:21.970> two<00:02:22.180> weeks<00:02:22.330> because

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
normally within those two weeks because

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.330 
normally within those two weeks because
I've<00:02:22.840> used<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.140> lot<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.410> product<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.190> I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
I've used a lot of product on it I

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.640 
I've used a lot of product on it I
straightened<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.330> loads<00:02:25.569> compared<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> normal

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
straightened it loads compared to normal

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.339 
straightened it loads compared to normal
and<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.330> needed<00:02:28.569> it<00:02:28.780> straight<00:02:29.080> for<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
and because I needed it straight for a

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.910 
and because I needed it straight for a
show<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.330> normally<00:02:31.780> fades<00:02:32.080> actually<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> lot

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
show so it normally fades actually a lot

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.430 
show so it normally fades actually a lot
less<00:02:33.819> quickly<00:02:34.239> than<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.599> has<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.930> time<00:02:35.140> so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
less quickly than it has this time so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.330 
less quickly than it has this time so
this<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.920> free<00:02:36.099> week<00:02:36.280> fade<00:02:36.550> um<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:38.410> lots

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
of heat treatment and product treatment

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.580 
of heat treatment and product treatment
on<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.670> intense<00:02:43.360> red<00:02:43.720> number<00:02:44.049> 71<00:02:46.380> at<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
on the intense red number 71 at the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.000 
on the intense red number 71 at the
moment<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.660> reddish<00:02:50.110> pink<00:02:50.440> obviously

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
moment it's a reddish pink obviously

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.330 
moment it's a reddish pink obviously
I've<00:02:51.100> got<00:02:51.280> my<00:02:51.370> orange<00:02:51.760> bit<00:02:52.030> still<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
I've got my orange bit still in it and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.699 
I've got my orange bit still in it and
but<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> reason<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.600> fade<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.140> that

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
but the reason I like the fade is that

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.410 
but the reason I like the fade is that
even<00:02:57.069> though<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.700> reddish<00:02:57.970> pink<00:02:58.209> right

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
even though it's a reddish pink right

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.110 
even though it's a reddish pink right
now<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.019> like<00:02:59.230> red<00:02:59.500> hair<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.760> nice

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
now and I like red hair this is a nice

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.830 
now and I like red hair this is a nice
shade<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:03.250> door<00:03:03.519> seems<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.269> for<00:03:04.599> some

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
shade and the door seems to for some

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.500 
shade and the door seems to for some
reason<00:03:05.230> compared<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.769> other<00:03:05.980> colors<00:03:06.510> fade

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
reason compared to other colors fade

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.320 
reason compared to other colors fade
nicely<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.890> doesn't<00:03:09.220> fade<00:03:09.459> actually<00:03:10.120> all

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
nicely so it doesn't fade actually all

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.180 
nicely so it doesn't fade actually all
it's<00:03:10.599> all<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.049> same<00:03:11.230> pink<00:03:11.709> all<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.069> way

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
it's all the same pink all the way

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.470 
it's all the same pink all the way
through<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:15.069> fades<00:03:15.430> sort<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.120> effects

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
through and it fades sort of effects

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.620 
through and it fades sort of effects
from<00:03:16.630> dark<00:03:16.930> red<00:03:17.260> light<00:03:17.769> red<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.700> dark<00:03:18.940> pink<00:03:19.329> to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
from dark red light red to dark pink to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.110 
from dark red light red to dark pink to
light<00:03:19.840> pink<00:03:20.109> very<00:03:20.620> gradually<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.609> smoothly

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
light pink very gradually very smoothly

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.660 
light pink very gradually very smoothly
so<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.079> don't<00:03:23.350> notice<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.859> big<00:03:24.100> fade<00:03:24.430> when

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
so you don't notice a big fade when

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.310 
so you don't notice a big fade when
you've<00:03:24.850> washed<00:03:25.060> your<00:03:25.239> hair<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:26.200> you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
you've washed your hair when you

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.770
