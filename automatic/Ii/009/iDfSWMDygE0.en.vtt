00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 friends thank you for continuing with 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.210
 us here at the end and yesterday I 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 we present therefore this altercation that had 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.679
 our partner christian martinoli 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.410
 with miguel the louse herrera and we are going to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.799
 see something that I predicted yesterday 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799
 precisely 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.539
 teach something bold 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.339
 let's listen 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.710
 I'm not in trouble, I do not want to be 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.210
 sorcerer but according to surely the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.399
 Mexican soccer federation is going to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.450
 dispense with their service you hear what 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.850
 what I say 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.010
 well this we said yesterday exactly 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 already dismissed the louse herrera what's going 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.260
 to go through the good but avoidable louse 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.910
 by truth phone very well let's go 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.910
 to see him Garcia too 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.330
 that was a crazy scenario not a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 uncontrolled madness where good 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.090
 Miguel starts not to settle for 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.940
 normally and then there are a couple of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.190
 Attempts to try kicking punching 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.410
 put in front of Miguel to calm the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.180
 situation they say is my back and I 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.780
 confirms that there is a there is a blow a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.440
 small blow to the neck as such is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.940
 They carry 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.880
 I think security agent the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.470
 selection takes miguel de amiga 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 forgive cristiam art that forms pressure 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 very sensible and try to move the subject 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 of the postures and well then finished 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.910
 detonating if there is a situation it seems 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 who then meet again in 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.770
 migration and signs of aggression 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.719
 verbal 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 and good so there is no doubt about the 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.039
 aggression what you see on your screen is a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 image of how the blow was left to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.240
 our partner christian martinoli 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.429
 unfortunate situation after seeing this 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.069
 in Philadelphia precisely when the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.899
 louse attacks christian 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.270
 cristian martinoli raises hands 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.850
 precisely as he does not want 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.549
 aggression in peace but see there is 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.520
 the blow and the metiche daughter 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.100
 daughter throws it also and especially 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.380
 threw luis garcía and also what 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.360
 slapped what horror but also to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 Chamaca metiche and that is that they do not have 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.009
 education but they have what they 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.009
 they deserve 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:18.240
 three letters that we have as people 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.720
 that's why we're going to say 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.740
 let's see let's see we 'll see there we're at 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 gustavo matosas 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.340
 to the colt also to caixiña we have 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.830
 also and the tuca ferretti 94 wants to be 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870
 well it would have to be the tuca but I think 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.000
 that he will never accept the selection 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.160
 he always said he would be the one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.540
 I would have to be in that place this one 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.580
 he will accept it here he says 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.820
 definitely that he does not stay 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.760
 although he would be the one chosen but here he speaks 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.520
 my letters that would be to give a letter 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.370
 to stay I tell you someone young for me 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760
 is the other little less because it is the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.760
 next 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.760
 of plane then this one you got it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.320
 in the louse this is the chosen one and I 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.310
 I want to know quickly what are you going to use 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.620
 with the family of the louse 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.890
 with the daughter for example gives me a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.980
 letter is good remember that everything 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.750
 that goes up low and careful that we do not have 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.800
 you a control whenever you 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.510
 you want to believe in a power 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.390
 You will definitely never have it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 then queen this they fell off their 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.890
 can simply things are not going to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 get out very well for them my witch another 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.760
 of things Martinoli is afraid of 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.849
 come back to face the louse 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.849
 herrera 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.120
 of course it was not his job and I 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.120
 I think he would have to see us hit 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.769
 all because we all said it 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.230
 unfortunately he is not so sure of what 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.090
 what did I think the job was 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.470
 someone who did not have a beginning nor 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.049
 culture that work ends the race 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.170
 from the old man I do not think I do not think that 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.760
 finish but there should not be a letter 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.599
 for the worst, let's go to the safe 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.709
 how many do you want one that we are going to give away 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.709
 a poorer 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.420
 this is not going to end in fact 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.310
 unfortunately you will see someone from 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.090
 blond test that will want to support it 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.980
 within what is this political bloc 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.799
 but I do not finish it waits a little while 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.690
 keys 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.110
 is in Mexico or goes to the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.009
 abroad this will be the last letter 14 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.009
 wants to give me 3 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.020
 and we are more for the louse herrera 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.690
 we know that mexico is going for the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.060
 good foreign goes out sales 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.039
 you were short is going to save about four 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.740
 months or so and I have to a 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.830
 proposal and the caldito indicates way not 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.389
 he stays here he has shame and he will leave 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.919
 will continue with its aggressive problem 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.630

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.520
