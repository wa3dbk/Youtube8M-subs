in<00:02:03.319> solo<00:02:03.560> only<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.429> can<00:02:04.609> pick<00:02:04.880> up<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.149> navcard

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
in solo only you can pick up the navcard

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.569 
in solo only you can pick up the navcard
and<00:02:05.959> in<00:02:06.229> other<00:02:06.380> games<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.100> start<00:02:07.369> with

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
and in other games you just start with

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.270 
and in other games you just start with
it<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.200> basically<00:02:09.200> one<00:02:09.470> thing<00:02:09.649> i<00:02:09.770> found<00:02:09.979> though

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
it so basically one thing i found though

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.300 
it so basically one thing i found though
is<00:02:11.140> everyone<00:02:12.140> off<00:02:12.290> played<00:02:12.500> with<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.709> far<00:02:13.069> who

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
is everyone off played with so far who

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.090 
is everyone off played with so far who
didn't<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.120> still<00:02:15.020> has<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> old<00:02:15.410> transit

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
didn't do this still has the old transit

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.330 
didn't do this still has the old transit
nav<00:02:16.310> card<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.030> i<00:02:17.270> had<00:02:18.170> had<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.770> bit<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.069> thought

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
nav card so i had had a bit of a thought

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340 
nav card so i had had a bit of a thought
about<00:02:19.720> about<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.020> might<00:02:21.200> mean<00:02:21.230> and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
about about what this might mean and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.170 
about about what this might mean and
I basically<00:02:22.830> came<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> conclusion<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
I basically came to the conclusion that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.220 
I basically came to the conclusion that
I<00:02:25.100> wanted<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.310> see<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.420> nav<00:02:27.690> card<00:02:27.960> would

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I wanted to see if this nav card would

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.190 
I wanted to see if this nav card would
work<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.730> nav<00:02:30.060> card<00:02:30.330> table<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
work in the in the nav card table in the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.700 
work in the in the nav card table in the
old<00:02:31.440> transit<00:02:32.100> map<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.260> saw<00:02:34.260> Bridget<00:02:34.410> bugger

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
old transit map so I saw Bridget bugger

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.680 
old transit map so I saw Bridget bugger
eyes<00:02:34.980> around<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.490> here<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> bit<00:02:36.090> longer<00:02:36.270> and

I'm going to skip up to the footage of

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.660 
I'm going to skip up to the footage of
transit<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:05.010> we're<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.340> see<00:03:05.550> what

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
happened when we went out to the nav

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.340 
happened when we went out to the nav
card<00:03:07.740> table<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:10.050> we<00:03:10.140> had<00:03:10.260> just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
card table so here we are we had just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.860 
card table so here we are we had just
headed<00:03:10.680> out<00:03:10.770> towards<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:12.210> cornfield<00:03:12.690> now

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
headed out towards the the cornfield now

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.410 
headed out towards the the cornfield now
and<00:03:13.140> what<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.920> tell<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.670> doesn't<00:03:15.120> go

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
and what I can tell you is it doesn't go

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.480 
and what I can tell you is it doesn't go
into<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.930> bus<00:03:16.080> driver<00:03:16.320> or<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.830> thing<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.340> all

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
into the bus driver or this thing at all

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.810 
into the bus driver or this thing at all
so<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.850> don't<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.180> what<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.570> but

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
so I don't know what that is but

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.400 
so I don't know what that is but
basically<00:03:20.820> some<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> other<00:03:21.960> things<00:03:22.170> is

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
basically some of the other things is

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.460 
basically some of the other things is
that<00:03:22.470> your<00:03:22.830> permanent<00:03:23.330> insta<00:03:24.330> revived<00:03:25.020> thing

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that your permanent insta revived thing

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.740 
that your permanent insta revived thing
or<00:03:25.830> quick<00:03:26.340> revive<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.030> your<00:03:27.150> permanent<00:03:27.450> jug

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
or quick revive and your permanent jug

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.900 
or quick revive and your permanent jug
do<00:03:28.050> carry<00:03:28.350> over<00:03:28.530> into<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.950> new<00:03:29.160> map<00:03:29.370> they<00:03:29.670> are

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
do carry over into the new map they are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.210 
do carry over into the new map they are
still<00:03:30.240> lose<00:03:30.600> herbal<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:31.470> they<00:03:31.710> are<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.070> this

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
still lose herbal as they are in this

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.880 
still lose herbal as they are in this
but<00:03:33.060> they<00:03:33.480> do<00:03:33.540> carry<00:03:33.900> over<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.620> always<00:03:34.740> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
but they do carry over so it's always a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.100 
but they do carry over so it's always a
positive<00:03:35.310> thing<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.450> thought<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.020> might

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
positive thing but I thought I might

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.890 
positive thing but I thought I might
just<00:03:37.410> add<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.740> one<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:37.980> there<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.900> we'll

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
just add that one in there and we'll

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.290 
just add that one in there and we'll
just<00:03:40.110> run<00:03:40.410> out<00:03:40.740> here<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.250> does<00:03:41.550> make<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.970> really

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
just run out here it does make it really

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.940 
just run out here it does make it really
handy<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:42.720> some<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.020> those<00:03:43.080> initial<00:03:43.560> zombies

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
handy on some of those initial zombies

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.520 
handy on some of those initial zombies
in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> new<00:03:44.550> map<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.210> we're<00:03:46.170> going<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.380> run<00:03:46.500> out

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
in the new map so we're going to run out

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.470 
in the new map so we're going to run out
here<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.310> see<00:03:47.520> we've<00:03:47.730> got<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> I've

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
the incorrect navcard so pretty

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.520 
the incorrect navcard so pretty
disappointing<00:03:56.790> again<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:58.850> mean<00:03:59.850> I'd<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
disappointing again I mean I'd have a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.560 
disappointing again I mean I'd have a
little<00:04:01.710> bit<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:02.090> little<00:04:03.090> bit<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.330> rage

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
little bit of a little bit of a rage

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.010 
little bit of a little bit of a rage
here<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.320> whatnot<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:06.060> mean<00:04:06.840> there

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
here and and whatnot but I mean there

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.810 
here and and whatnot but I mean there
was<00:04:07.140> enough<00:04:07.380> nothing<00:04:08.040> else<00:04:08.220> for<00:04:08.340> me<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.490> do<00:04:08.700> in

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
was enough nothing else for me to do in

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.550 
was enough nothing else for me to do in
here<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.240> I<00:04:09.270> really<00:04:09.870> wanted<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.140> get<00:04:10.260> back<00:04:10.410> to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
here and I really wanted to get back to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
here and I really wanted to get back to
the<00:04:10.650> new<00:04:10.770> map<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.160> quit<00:04:11.490> out<00:04:11.610> straight<00:04:11.910> away

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the new map so I quit out straight away

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.890 
the new map so I quit out straight away
to<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:13.020> go<00:04:13.200> back<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:14.240> as<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.570> said<00:04:15.630> with<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
to to go back but as I said with that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.510 
to to go back but as I said with that
jug<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.440> actually<00:04:16.739> carries<00:04:17.040> over<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.400> that

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
jug it actually carries over and that

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.550 
jug it actually carries over and that
helps<00:04:17.820> because<00:04:18.000> some<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.020> zombies<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
helps because some of the zombies in the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.289 
helps because some of the zombies in the
new<00:04:19.710> map<00:04:19.890> actually<00:04:20.220> are<00:04:20.640> wearing<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.090> bit<00:04:21.210> of

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
new map actually are wearing a bit of

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.500 
new map actually are wearing a bit of
body<00:04:21.480> armor<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.109> if<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.190> even<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> first

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
body armor and if I even in the first

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
body armor and if I even in the first
level<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.960> notice<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.440> because<00:04:25.560> they<00:04:26.430> take<00:04:26.670> to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
level you notice it because they take to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.450 
level you notice it because they take to
get<00:04:27.270> two<00:04:27.720> hits<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.110> kill<00:04:28.140> rather<00:04:28.620> than<00:04:28.920> rather

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
get two hits to kill rather than rather

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.239 
get two hits to kill rather than rather
than<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.880> one<00:04:30.030> they<00:04:30.060> would<00:04:30.300> usually<00:04:30.450> take<00:04:30.690> in

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 
than the one they would usually take in

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.149
