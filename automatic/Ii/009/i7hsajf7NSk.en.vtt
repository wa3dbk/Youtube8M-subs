 the organization of the world cup 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.760
 for a country in the region is a goal 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.760
 central for concacaf 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.130
 so its leaders will do everything 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.100
 possible to get it 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.610
 our main task in the short term 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.490
 will be to obtain the headquarters of the world already 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.700
 it would have been 32 years since the last 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.700
 world that he organized with taca 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 united states-1994 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 It's too much time 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.060
 We will support him 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.430
 completely but I have to say that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.940
 we will strategically choose whoever has 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.519
 more options to be world champion 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.390
 the manager only referred in a way 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.090
 specific to canada 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.770
 they will use some advantage as soon as 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.810
 organization since they have the world 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.530
 female sub-20 in August and the highest 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.730
 female the other year but both should 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.700
 be incredible to be considered 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.670
 I express with who is also 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.690

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.260
 and usa 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.600
 which is more likely to be 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.960
 world champion is the selection of 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.830
 mexico by currently 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.940
