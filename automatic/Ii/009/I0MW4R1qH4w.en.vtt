actually a pretty interesting toy
actually<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.680> vehicle<00:01:00.100> mode<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:01.050> something<00:01:02.050> I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
actually the vehicle mode is something I

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.540 
actually the vehicle mode is something I
don't<00:01:02.379> really<00:01:02.440> know<00:01:02.649> what<00:01:02.860> this<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.219> it's<00:01:03.399> kind

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
don't really know what this is it's kind

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.040 
don't really know what this is it's kind
of<00:01:03.579> some<00:01:03.790> kind<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.180> lawnmower<00:01:04.509> slash

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050

construction kind of vehicle or some

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.430 
construction kind of vehicle or some
sorts<00:01:07.210> it's<00:01:07.810> really<00:01:07.990> hard<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.229> tell<00:01:08.380> exactly

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
sorts it's really hard to tell exactly

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.139 
sorts it's really hard to tell exactly
what<00:01:09.039> this<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.220> especially<00:01:09.610> because<00:01:09.789> of<00:01:10.060> the

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
what this is especially because of the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.400 
what this is especially because of the
drills<00:01:10.390> and<00:01:10.479> all<00:01:10.539> that<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:10.869> maybe<00:01:11.080> some<00:01:11.320> kind

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
drills and all that so maybe some kind

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.200 
drills and all that so maybe some kind
of<00:01:11.500> drilling<00:01:11.800> construction<00:01:12.789> vehicle<00:01:13.149> or

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
of drilling construction vehicle or

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.600 
of drilling construction vehicle or
something<00:01:13.360> I'm<00:01:14.080> not<00:01:14.140> quite<00:01:14.740> exactly<00:01:15.039> sure

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
something I'm not quite exactly sure

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.100 
something I'm not quite exactly sure
what<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:15.940> anyways<00:01:16.539> we'll<00:01:16.690> take<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.869> look<00:01:17.050> at

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
what it is anyways we'll take a look at

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.840 
what it is anyways we'll take a look at
the<00:01:17.200> boxes<00:01:17.680> see<00:01:18.039> it<00:01:18.160> shows<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> picture<00:01:18.550> of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
the boxes see it shows a picture of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.609 
the boxes see it shows a picture of
fixed<00:01:19.149> up<00:01:19.270> there<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.630> there's<00:01:19.840> quite<00:01:20.200> amount

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
fixed up there and there's quite amount

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.700 
fixed up there and there's quite amount
of<00:01:20.710> tape<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.369> one<00:01:21.550> steps<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.000> I've<00:01:22.090> seen

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of tape on the one steps that I've seen

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060 
of tape on the one steps that I've seen
another<00:01:23.710> photo<00:01:24.280> will<00:01:24.460> fix<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.770> transforms<00:01:26.770> in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
another photo will fix it transforms in

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.450 
another photo will fix it transforms in
well<00:01:27.790> supposedly<00:01:28.270> one<00:01:28.570> step<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:30.280> once

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
well supposedly one step and for once

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.070 
well supposedly one step and for once
this<00:01:30.670> thing's<00:01:30.909> actually<00:01:31.060> one<00:01:31.600> steps<00:01:31.869> or<00:01:32.049> the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
this thing's actually one steps or the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.210 
this thing's actually one steps or the
other<00:01:32.290> once<00:01:32.500> they're<00:01:32.680> changers<00:01:32.979> throughout

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
other once they're changers throughout

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.359 
other once they're changers throughout
so<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.549> have<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.820> do<00:01:33.939> a<00:01:33.970> multiple<00:01:34.210> step<00:01:34.869> that's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so you have to do a multiple step that's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.590 
so you have to do a multiple step that's
just<00:01:36.369> moving<00:01:36.640> an<00:01:36.729> arm<00:01:36.880> or<00:01:37.119> something<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.450> fully

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
just moving an arm or something to fully

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120 
just moving an arm or something to fully
transfer<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.140> friend<00:01:38.439> it's<00:01:38.740> pretty<00:01:38.979> much

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
transfer but friend it's pretty much

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.030 
transfer but friend it's pretty much
full<00:01:39.340> one<00:01:39.610> step<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:41.140> got<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.290> bunch<00:01:41.799> of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
full one step it's got a bunch of

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.760 
full one step it's got a bunch of
different<00:01:43.080> bilingual<00:01:44.080> packaging<00:01:44.590> there

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
different bilingual packaging there

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.890 
different bilingual packaging there
shows<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.549> other<00:01:45.729> way<00:01:45.939> figures<00:01:46.720> in<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
shows that the other way figures in the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.630 
shows that the other way figures in the
wave<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.170> grimlock<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.799> steel<00:01:48.130> jaw<00:01:48.340> which<00:01:48.520> i

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
wave is grimlock and steel jaw which i

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.450 
wave is grimlock and steel jaw which i
will<00:01:48.700> not<00:01:48.880> be<00:01:49.030> getting<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.290> anyways<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:51.250> terms

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
will not be getting but anyways in terms

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.120 
will not be getting but anyways in terms
of<00:01:51.759> rolling<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:53.049> does<00:01:53.409> pretty<00:01:53.740> well<00:01:53.950> actually

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
of rolling it does pretty well actually

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.580 
of rolling it does pretty well actually
the<00:01:55.090> bottom<00:01:55.270> there's<00:01:55.720> four<00:01:55.960> plastic<00:01:56.229> wheels

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the bottom there's four plastic wheels

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.399 
the bottom there's four plastic wheels
that<00:01:56.890> turn<00:01:57.100> pretty<00:01:57.549> well<00:01:57.790> on<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.320> pull<00:01:59.320> on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
that turn pretty well on you do pull on

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.859 
that turn pretty well on you do pull on
the<00:01:59.470> ground<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:01.030> good<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.420> they're

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
the ground so it's good that they're

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.830 
the ground so it's good that they're
able<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> roll<00:02:02.740> pretty<00:02:02.979> well<00:02:03.189> now<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:04.180> terms<00:02:04.509> of

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
able to roll pretty well now in terms of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.740 
able to roll pretty well now in terms of
comparison<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:06.369> he<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.549> next<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.390> RI<00:02:07.570> d

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
comparison here he is next to the RI d

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.640 
comparison here he is next to the RI d
deluxe<00:02:08.259> Bovie<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:10.650> it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
deluxe Bovie as you can see it's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.789 
deluxe Bovie as you can see it's
actually<00:02:11.890> pretty<00:02:12.900> good<00:02:13.900> scaled<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.680> in

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
actually pretty good scaled actually in

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.910 
actually pretty good scaled actually in
vehicle<00:02:15.310> mounts<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.320> think<00:02:17.320> fixed<00:02:17.769> it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
vehicle mounts so I think fixed it's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.199 
vehicle mounts so I think fixed it's
actually<00:02:18.340> pretty<00:02:18.700> interesting

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
actually pretty interesting

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.509 
actually pretty interesting
anyways<00:02:20.079> transformer<00:02:20.769> it's<00:02:20.920> pretty<00:02:21.220> simple

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
anyways transformer it's pretty simple

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.610 
anyways transformer it's pretty simple
all<00:02:21.579> you<00:02:21.700> gonna<00:02:21.820> do<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.230> pull<00:02:23.230> these<00:02:23.410> lever

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
all you gonna do is pull these lever

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.270 
all you gonna do is pull these lever
pieces<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:25.650> lock<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.829> place<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
pieces and then a lock at the place and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.949 
pieces and then a lock at the place and
there<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.519> go<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.850> have<00:02:27.880> fixed<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.720> his

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
there you go you have fixed it in his

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.320 
there you go you have fixed it in his
rope<00:02:29.680> mode<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.730> mode<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.000> could

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
rope mode now in this mode you could

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.540 
rope mode now in this mode you could
still<00:02:31.569> roll<00:02:31.750> around<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.430> way

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
still roll around as well and the way

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.380 
still roll around as well and the way
that<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.879> designed<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.360> said<00:02:34.599> he<00:02:34.690> kind<00:02:34.930> of

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that it's designed to said he kind of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.619 
that it's designed to said he kind of
doesn't<00:02:37.390> exactly<00:02:37.689> state<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.540> kind<00:02:40.540> of

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
doesn't exactly state like this kind of

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.770 
doesn't exactly state like this kind of
droops<00:02:41.200> down<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.470> bit<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:43.150> wheels<00:02:43.450> will

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
droops down a bit as this wheels will

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.990 
droops down a bit as this wheels will
once<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.439> call<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.769> big<00:02:44.950> wheels<00:02:45.189> cause<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:45.849> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
once I call the big wheels cause them to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.869 
once I call the big wheels cause them to
not<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.390> steam<00:02:46.720> flat<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.400> does<00:02:48.579> cause

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
not really steam flat so it does cause

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.910 
not really steam flat so it does cause
them<00:02:49.060> depends<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.480> bit<00:02:49.510> which<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.079> actually<00:02:50.500> not

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
them depends a bit which is actually not

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.589 
them depends a bit which is actually not
too<00:02:51.129> bad<00:02:51.280> actually<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.909> think<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.209> pretty

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
too bad actually and I think it's pretty

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.920 
too bad actually and I think it's pretty
cool<00:02:53.459> though<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.090> overall<00:02:55.359> design

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
cool though of the overall design

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.110 
cool though of the overall design
now<00:02:56.349> articulation<00:02:57.010> points<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:57.909> actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
now articulation points I'm actually

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.599 
now articulation points I'm actually
surprised<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.720> see<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.069> he<00:03:00.069> actually<00:03:00.459> has

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
surprised to see that he actually has

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.490 
surprised to see that he actually has
two<00:03:00.939> points<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.299> articulation<00:03:01.450> which<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.260> both

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
two points of articulation which is both

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.740 
two points of articulation which is both
in<00:03:02.650> his<00:03:02.739> arms<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.250> his<00:03:03.790> arms<00:03:03.909> aren't<00:03:04.209> that

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
in his arms now his arms aren't that

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.589 
in his arms now his arms aren't that
ridiculously<00:03:05.500> articulate<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.849> for<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.359> step

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
ridiculously articulate but for one step

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.670 
ridiculously articulate but for one step
this<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.750> actually<00:03:08.049> kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> surprising<00:03:08.560> this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
this is actually kind of surprising this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.940 
this is actually kind of surprising this
knee<00:03:08.799> articulation<00:03:08.920> at<00:03:09.519> all<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.590> pretty

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
knee articulation at all so it's pretty

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.849 
knee articulation at all so it's pretty
cool<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:12.670> fix<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.959> he<00:03:14.709> actually

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
cool what fix it is and he actually

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.319 
cool what fix it is and he actually
looks<00:03:15.159> pretty<00:03:15.250> well<00:03:15.609> next<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> other

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
looks pretty well next to the other

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.259 
looks pretty well next to the other
Autobots<00:03:16.540> which<00:03:16.989> I'll<00:03:17.230> show<00:03:17.829> right<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:18.819> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
Autobots which I'll show right now and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.009 
Autobots which I'll show right now and
I'll<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:19.959> back<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.700> he<00:03:21.790> could<00:03:21.970> see<00:03:22.180> he<00:03:22.659> actually

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
I'll be back so he could see he actually

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.149 
I'll be back so he could see he actually
scales<00:03:23.260> pretty<00:03:23.530> well<00:03:23.769> with<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> other

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
scales pretty well with the other

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.190 
scales pretty well with the other
Autobots<00:03:24.370> even<00:03:25.090> for<00:03:25.329> not<00:03:25.480> being<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.900> deluxe

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
Autobots even for not being a deluxe

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.869 
Autobots even for not being a deluxe
scale<00:03:26.590> figure<00:03:26.950> I'm<00:03:27.129> actually<00:03:27.250> surprised<00:03:27.700> how

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
scale figure I'm actually surprised how

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.119 
scale figure I'm actually surprised how
well<00:03:28.030> house<00:03:28.209> bro<00:03:28.510> has<00:03:28.659> Takara<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.739> able<00:03:30.040> to

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
well house bro has Takara is able to

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.580 
well house bro has Takara is able to
design<00:03:30.400> figure<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.019> actually<00:03:32.200> stays

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
design figure so that it actually stays

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.020 
design figure so that it actually stays
pretty<00:03:33.040> well<00:03:33.280> scale<00:03:33.579> with<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.879> other

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
pretty well scale with the other

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.720 
pretty well scale with the other
Autobots<00:03:34.540> as<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.840> can<00:03:34.959> see<00:03:35.310> even<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.489> show

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
Autobots as you can see even in the show

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.309 
Autobots as you can see even in the show
he<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.209> lot<00:03:37.450> smaller<00:03:37.750> than<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.230> other

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
he is a lot smaller than the other

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.830 
he is a lot smaller than the other
Autobots<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.250> obviously<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.239> don't<00:03:40.359> have<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
Autobots and obviously I don't have the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.720 
Autobots and obviously I don't have the
deluxe<00:03:41.109> Grimlock<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.739> I'm<00:03:42.220> not<00:03:42.549> planning

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
deluxe Grimlock and I'm not planning

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.569 
deluxe Grimlock and I'm not planning
getting<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.859> he<00:03:44.859> does<00:03:45.010> actually<00:03:45.250> scale

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
getting it but he does actually scale

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.099 
getting it but he does actually scale
well<00:03:45.730> with<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> three<00:03:46.269> step<00:03:46.510> change<00:03:46.720> remarks

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
well with the three step change remarks

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.330 
well with the three step change remarks
and<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.349> obviously<00:03:47.919> because<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.190> that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and it's obviously because of that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.879 
and it's obviously because of that
Grimlock<00:03:48.699> is<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.870> larger<00:03:50.230> figure<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.769> all

looking<00:04:38.349> forward<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.770> under<00:04:38.949> bite<00:04:39.070> figure

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
looking forward to the under bite figure

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.250 
looking forward to the under bite figure
but<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.639> sucks<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.000> it<00:04:40.210> ended<00:04:40.449> them<00:04:40.539> busting

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
but it sucks that it ended them busting

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.620 
but it sucks that it ended them busting
on<00:04:41.380> me<00:04:41.470> over<00:04:41.650> time<00:04:41.860> but<00:04:42.370> I'm<00:04:43.120> pretty<00:04:43.360> sure<00:04:43.479> that

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
on me over time but I'm pretty sure that

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.540 
on me over time but I'm pretty sure that
fixed<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.169> lot<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.800> are<00:04:44.919> designed<00:04:45.279> and

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
fixed it is a lot that are designed and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.260 
fixed it is a lot that are designed and
hopefully<00:04:46.500> he<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.529> going<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.460> stay

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
hopefully he is going to stay

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.180 
hopefully he is going to stay
pretty<00:04:49.570> well<00:04:49.780> together<00:04:49.960> for<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.590> long<00:04:50.830> period
