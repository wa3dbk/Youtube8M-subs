00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
oh yeah the top one pedicure calculi did

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.759 
oh yeah the top one pedicure calculi did
so<00:02:51.230> i<00:02:51.470> think<00:02:51.590> i<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:52.040> see<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.769> this
