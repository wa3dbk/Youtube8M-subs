00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.649 

so<00:00:54.489> what's<00:00:54.699> happening<00:00:54.969> though<00:00:55.149> basically<00:00:55.480> the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
so what's happening though basically the

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.750 
so what's happening though basically the
jobs<00:00:55.839> are<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.079> off<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.379> another<00:00:56.559> PC<00:00:57.100> which

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
jobs are going off to another PC which

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.509 
jobs are going off to another PC which
has<00:00:58.059> these<00:00:58.539> applications<00:00:59.320> installed<00:00:59.769> the

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
has these applications installed the

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.069 
has these applications installed the
tops<00:01:00.729> are<00:01:00.879> being<00:01:01.030> processed<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.870> then

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
tops are being processed and then

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.350 
tops are being processed and then
submitted<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> print<00:01:03.280> queue<00:01:03.549> he's<00:01:04.330> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
submitted to the print queue he's a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420 
submitted to the print queue he's a
follow<00:01:04.780> me<00:01:04.989> or<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.290> direct<00:01:05.560> print<00:01:05.830> queue<00:01:06.009> and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
follow me or the direct print queue and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.740 
follow me or the direct print queue and
he<00:01:06.549> has<00:01:06.729> configured<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.299> can<00:01:10.450> see<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
he has configured as you can see the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
he has configured as you can see the
jobs<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.140> being<00:01:11.289> rendered<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.430> submitted

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 

and<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.420> seen<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.050> user<00:01:22.230> what's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and it all seen it for the user what's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.120 
and it all seen it for the user what's
happened<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:22.980> print<00:01:23.280> jobs<00:01:24.890> user<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
happened to those print jobs user can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
happened to those print jobs user can
then<00:01:26.160> case<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> release<00:01:27.390> queue<00:01:27.660> or<00:01:27.840> could<00:01:28.440> be

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
then case the release queue or could be

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
then case the release queue or could be
an<00:01:28.800> embedded<00:01:29.280> terminal<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.910> an<00:01:30.270> external

an embedded terminal or an external

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
an embedded terminal or an external
device<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> MFD<00:01:33.620> they<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.770> print<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:35.040> they

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
device the MFD they can print well they

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.680 
device the MFD they can print well they
can<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.280> cancel<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.880> job<00:01:36.060> accordingly<00:01:38.690> once

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
can just cancel the job accordingly once

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.090 
can just cancel the job accordingly once
they've<00:01:39.870> done<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.050> they<00:01:40.260> can<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.740> log<00:01:40.920> out

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
they've done that they can then log out

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.450 
they've done that they can then log out
of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.370> system<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> they'll<00:01:43.830> log<00:01:43.980> back<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
of the system so they'll log back in as

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.250 
of the system so they'll log back in as
the<00:01:44.580> administrator<00:01:45.120> just<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.080> what's

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
the administrator just to see what's

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.940 
the administrator just to see what's
happened<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> his<00:01:46.710> print<00:01:46.920> jobs<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:48.800> we<00:01:49.800> can

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
happened to his print jobs and we can

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.810 
happened to his print jobs and we can
look<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.220> pro<00:01:50.400> keys

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.219 

look<00:01:55.420> at<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.600> job<00:01:55.780> log

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.389 

and<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.560> see<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.920> two<00:02:01.070> jobs<00:02:01.250> are

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
and as you can see the two jobs are

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.240 
and as you can see the two jobs are
printed<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.149> last<00:02:02.329> one<00:02:02.450> was<00:02:02.539> counseled

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
printed and the last one was counseled

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.219 
printed and the last one was counseled
very<00:02:04.250> simple<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:07.759> how<00:02:07.969> does<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.119> work<00:02:08.420> from

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
very simple so how does that work from

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.979 
very simple so how does that work from
the<00:02:09.349> processing<00:02:09.890> end<00:02:10.540> factor<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.780> to

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
the processing end factor you have to

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.390 
the processing end factor you have to
have<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> VC<00:02:12.560> installed<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
have a VC installed with the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.990 
have a VC installed with the
applications<00:02:14.150> running<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.610> we're<00:02:16.790> going<00:02:16.910> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
applications running so we're going to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.509 
applications running so we're going to
do<00:02:17.060> we're<00:02:17.180> gonna<00:02:17.330> log<00:02:17.450> into<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.840> PC<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
do we're gonna log into that PC as you

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.470 
do we're gonna log into that PC as you
can<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.760> there's<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:19.910> little<00:02:20.090> green<00:02:20.209> box

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
can see there's a little green box

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.520 
can see there's a little green box
running<00:02:20.810> at<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.959> top<00:02:21.140> right<00:02:21.319> hand<00:02:21.440> corner

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
running at the top right hand corner

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.430 
running at the top right hand corner
that's<00:02:22.160> Regis<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.760> show<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.269> this<00:02:24.019> PC<00:02:24.410> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
that's Regis to show you that this PC is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.619 
that's Regis to show you that this PC is
actually<00:02:24.769> processing<00:02:25.280> jobs<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.450> we're<00:02:29.540> gonna

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
actually processing jobs so we're gonna

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.970 
actually processing jobs so we're gonna
update<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.989> couple<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.290> jobs<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:30.769> we<00:02:30.829> did

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
update a couple of jobs like we did

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.979 
update a couple of jobs like we did
previously<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.180> see<00:02:35.360> what<00:02:35.480> happens<00:02:35.780> when

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
previously you can see what happens when

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.460 
previously you can see what happens when
the<00:02:36.110> jobs<00:02:36.319> get<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.739> lady<00:02:38.140> let's<00:02:39.140> see<00:02:39.290> what's
