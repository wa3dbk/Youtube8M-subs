00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
where you really shine in your pop-up

books the choreography can you talk a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.990 
books the choreography can you talk a
little<00:00:16.580> bit<00:00:16.789> about<00:00:16.820> that<00:00:17.180> well<00:00:17.510> it's<00:00:18.910> it's<00:00:19.910> a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
little bit about that well it's it's a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.970 
little bit about that well it's it's a
struggle<00:00:20.269> it's<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.810> struggle<00:00:21.019> do<00:00:21.170> that<00:00:21.320> that<00:00:21.710> I

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
struggle it's a struggle do that that I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.520 
struggle it's a struggle do that that I
would<00:00:22.310> say<00:00:22.490> when<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.240> approach<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.720> pop-up<00:00:23.930> the

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
would say when I approach a pop-up the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.090 
would say when I approach a pop-up the
goal<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.670> to<00:00:26.000> get<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.480> dance<00:00:26.840> to<00:00:27.560> happen<00:00:27.920> the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
goal is to get a dance to happen the

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.240 
goal is to get a dance to happen the
paper<00:00:28.280> to<00:00:28.550> dance<00:00:28.850> into<00:00:29.240> place<00:00:30.250> sometimes

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
paper to dance into place sometimes

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.290 
paper to dance into place sometimes
sometimes<00:00:31.940> things<00:00:32.239> can't<00:00:32.599> happen<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:33.050> way

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
sometimes things can't happen that way

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.450 
sometimes things can't happen that way
so<00:00:35.300> I'm<00:00:35.359> for<00:00:35.539> instance<00:00:35.809> if<00:00:35.930> your<00:00:36.460> buildings

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
so I'm for instance if your buildings

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.279 
so I'm for instance if your buildings
for<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.789> particularly<00:00:38.300> difficult<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.170> do

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
for this particularly difficult to do

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.649 
for this particularly difficult to do
that<00:00:39.320> with<00:00:39.620> because<00:00:39.920> they<00:00:40.069> have<00:00:40.249> to<00:00:40.550> form<00:00:40.940> to

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
that with because they have to form to

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.160 
that with because they have to form to
look<00:00:41.929> what<00:00:42.229> there<00:00:42.469> are<00:00:42.859> and<00:00:43.989> sometimes<00:00:44.989> you

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
look what there are and sometimes you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.660 
look what there are and sometimes you
can<00:00:45.319> get<00:00:45.499> some<00:00:45.710> kind<00:00:45.829> of<00:00:45.949> movement<00:00:46.159> and<00:00:46.460> stuff

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
can get some kind of movement and stuff

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.419 
can get some kind of movement and stuff
in<00:00:46.789> there<00:00:46.999> but<00:00:47.199> a<00:00:48.199> lot<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:48.920> times<00:00:49.069> dig<00:00:49.309> just

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
in there but a lot of times dig just

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.279 
in there but a lot of times dig just
have<00:00:49.789> to<00:00:50.030> be<00:00:50.149> what<00:00:50.329> they<00:00:50.449> are<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:50.839> they<00:00:51.109> just

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
have to be what they are and they just

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.889 
have to be what they are and they just
spring<00:00:52.219> fully<00:00:52.549> formed<00:00:53.030> like<00:00:53.329> like<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:53.719> was<00:00:53.839> a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
spring fully formed like like it was a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:02.510 
spring fully formed like like it was a
book<00:00:54.049> I<00:00:54.170> did<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.379> did<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.769> Taj<00:00:55.039> Mahal

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.280 

Taj<00:01:02.940> Mahal<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.870> saying<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> not

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Taj Mahal now I'm not saying this is not

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.950 
Taj Mahal now I'm not saying this is not
this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.160> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> good<00:01:09.270> pop-up

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.630 

but<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.410> little<00:01:13.560> movement<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
but this very little movement in it it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
but this very little movement in it it
forms<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.479> forms<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:16.050> it's<00:01:16.380> supposed

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
forms and it forms the way it's supposed

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
forms and it forms the way it's supposed
to<00:01:16.710> yes<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:17.910> no<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.240> things<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to yes but there's no way for things to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.920 
to yes but there's no way for things to
be<00:01:18.960> flying<00:01:19.290> around<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> stuff<00:01:20.660> because<00:01:21.660> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
be flying around and stuff because it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.109 
be flying around and stuff because it
has<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.410> had<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.070> efficiently<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.940> its

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
has to had to get efficiently to its

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.160 
has to had to get efficiently to its
form<00:01:24.479> yes<00:01:25.410> but<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.310> also<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.960> things

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
form yes but and also when I want things

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.290 
form yes but and also when I want things
to<00:01:28.350> dance<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:28.920> place<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.580> has<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.940> be<00:01:30.030> done

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
to dance into place it has to be done

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.730 
to dance into place it has to be done
with<00:01:30.690> some<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> logic<00:01:33.200> sometimes<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
with some kind of logic sometimes in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.249 
with some kind of logic sometimes in
order<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> pop-up<00:01:36.630> there's<00:01:36.960> ways

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
order to get to the pop-up there's ways

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
order to get to the pop-up there's ways
that<00:01:37.649> there's<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.190> elegance<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.940> way<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that there's an elegance and the way the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.859 
that there's an elegance and the way the
things<00:01:39.450> unfold<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.160> sometimes

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
things unfold to get there but sometimes

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
things unfold to get there but sometimes
it<00:01:42.869> makes<00:01:43.110> no<00:01:43.320> sense<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.890> something<00:01:44.250> that's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it makes no sense for something that's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.029 
it makes no sense for something that's
that<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:45.750> inanimate<00:01:46.170> object<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
that that is an inanimate object to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.400 
that that is an inanimate object to
dance<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> sometimes<00:01:48.990> you're<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
dance so sometimes you're going to be

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.010 
dance so sometimes you're going to be
looking<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.979> what's<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.880> natural<00:01:51.450> movement

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
looking for what's the natural movement

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
looking for what's the natural movement
in<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.070> scene<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.580> was<00:01:53.700> real<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.979> an

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in that scene if it was real is there an

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.249 
in that scene if it was real is there an
animal<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> person<00:01:57.960> something

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
animal is there a person something

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.320 
animal is there a person something
moving<00:01:58.649> inside<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.430> pop-up<00:01:59.640> that's<00:02:00.119> when

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
moving inside that pop-up that's when

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.900 
moving inside that pop-up that's when
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.570> really<00:02:00.600> start<00:02:00.810> working<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:02.009> if

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
you can really start working on it or if

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.550 
you can really start working on it or if
you<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.330> I'm<00:02:03.570> doing<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.080> working<00:02:04.320> on

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you don't know I'm doing I'm working on

other<00:02:32.970> peaks<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.200> wanted<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
other peaks and I wanted that to be the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.319 
other peaks and I wanted that to be the
main<00:02:35.670> pop<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.870> what<00:02:37.650> moves<00:02:38.060> there's<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.299> a

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
main pop up so what moves there's not a

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.780 
main pop up so what moves there's not a
lot<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.540> movement<00:02:40.019> in<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.440> forms<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
lot of movement in that it forms and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.289 
lot of movement in that it forms and
stuff<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.600> there's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:44.299> made

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
stuff and so there's a little so I made

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.199 
stuff and so there's a little so I made
I<00:02:45.480> actually<00:02:45.750> made<00:02:46.079> wisps<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.920> fog<00:02:47.310> move<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
I actually made wisps of fog move the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.449 
I actually made wisps of fog move the
fog<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.660> where<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.079> fog<00:02:49.380> moves<00:02:49.829> okay<00:02:50.400> so

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
fog is where the fog moves okay so

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
fog is where the fog moves okay so
because<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.299> wanted<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.959> didn't<00:02:52.290> want<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
because I wanted I didn't want the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.039 
because I wanted I didn't want the
mountains<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.400> dance<00:02:53.700> into<00:02:54.090> place<00:02:54.360> because<00:02:54.900> it

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
mountains to dance into place because it

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.410 
mountains to dance into place because it
just<00:02:55.500> didn't<00:02:56.040> feel<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.790> do<00:02:57.060> that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
just didn't feel right to do that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.660 
just didn't feel right to do that
so<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.570> made<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> fog<00:02:58.230> move<00:02:58.620> into<00:02:58.769> place<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
so I made the fog move into place and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.069 
so I made the fog move into place and
then<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.030> could<00:03:00.269> go<00:03:00.390> back<00:03:00.420> him<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> small

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
then you could go back him the small

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.350 
then you could go back him the small
booklets<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.769> he<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.579> wildlife<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.239> in

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360

the<00:03:03.450> small

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
the small

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.860 
the small
pop-ups<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.550> are<00:03:04.970> inside<00:03:05.270> there<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.750> can

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
pop-ups that are inside there so you can

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.990 
pop-ups that are inside there so you can
get<00:03:05.990> close<00:03:06.470> down<00:03:06.740> on<00:03:06.950> something<00:03:07.280> because<00:03:07.670> when

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.530 
you're that far away you can't make an
animal<00:03:10.400> because<00:03:10.670> they<00:03:10.850> animals<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.180> size<00:03:11.330> of

if<00:03:57.320> I<00:03:57.440> had<00:03:57.620> one<00:03:57.860> building<00:03:58.280> like<00:03:59.240> for<00:03:59.480> instance

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
if I had one building like for instance

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.060 
if I had one building like for instance
this<00:03:59.990> this<00:04:00.320> little<00:04:00.470> guy<00:04:00.590> right<00:04:00.740> here

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
this this little guy right here

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.640 
this this little guy right here
it<00:04:01.459> forms<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.180> like<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.480> Taj<00:04:02.930> Mahal<00:04:02.959> did<00:04:03.470> in

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
it forms just like the Taj Mahal did in

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.280 
it forms just like the Taj Mahal did in
a<00:04:03.770> way<00:04:03.950> it's<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.370> static<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.810> interplay

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
a way it's a static it's the interplay

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.530 
a way it's a static it's the interplay
of<00:04:06.320> all<00:04:06.620> these<00:04:07.250> different<00:04:07.850> buildings<00:04:08.300> that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
of all these different buildings that

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.840 
of all these different buildings that
allowed<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.470> dance<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:10.040> happen<00:04:10.400> because<00:04:10.519> now

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
allowed that dance to happen because now

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.620 
allowed that dance to happen because now
they're<00:04:11.060> forming<00:04:11.870> elegantly<00:04:12.590> into<00:04:13.160> place

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
they're forming elegantly into place

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.599 
they're forming elegantly into place
okay<00:04:14.630> but<00:04:15.470> if<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.680> was<00:04:15.800> just<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.040> one<00:04:16.190> building

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
okay but if it was just the one building

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.159 
okay but if it was just the one building
I<00:04:16.700> wouldn't<00:04:16.910> be<00:04:16.970> able<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:17.480> because<00:04:17.870> I

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
I wouldn't be able to do that because I

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.770 
I wouldn't be able to do that because I
can't<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.820> part<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.570> building

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
can't have that part of the building

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.570 
can't have that part of the building
swinging<00:04:21.380> into<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.830> place<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.250> just<00:04:22.280> wouldn't

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
swinging into the place it just wouldn't

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.790 
swinging into the place it just wouldn't
look<00:04:22.669> right<00:04:22.730> you<00:04:23.330> know<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.350> all<00:04:24.440> has<00:04:24.650> to

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
look right you know it all has to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.580 
look right you know it all has to
coordinate<00:04:25.120> that's<00:04:26.120> coordinated<00:04:26.450> yes<00:04:26.840> this

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
coordinate that's coordinated yes this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.810 
coordinate that's coordinated yes this
little<00:04:27.830> tower<00:04:28.040> right<00:04:28.250> here<00:04:28.400> was<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.640> most

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
little tower right here was the most

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.240 
little tower right here was the most
difficult<00:04:29.270> part<00:04:29.540> of<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:29.780> had<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.830> get<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.130> to

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
difficult part of this had to get it to

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.210 
difficult part of this had to get it to
stand<00:04:31.580> up<00:04:31.850> all<00:04:32.090> by<00:04:32.450> itself<00:04:32.780> back<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.380> Oh<00:04:33.500> huh

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
stand up all by itself back there Oh huh

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.330 
stand up all by itself back there Oh huh
that<00:04:35.120> was<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.240> real<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:36.260> was<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:36.980> real<00:04:37.160> problem

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
that was a real it was a real problem

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.830 
that was a real it was a real problem
for<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.730> while<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:38.120> took<00:04:38.210> me<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.390> long<00:04:38.480> time<00:04:38.540> to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
for a while it took me a long time to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.370 
for a while it took me a long time to
figure<00:04:39.020> out<00:04:39.230> exactly<00:04:39.380> how<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.919> approach<00:04:40.280> that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
figure out exactly how to approach that

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.630 
figure out exactly how to approach that
you've<00:04:42.380> got<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.620> supported<00:04:43.100> by<00:04:43.220> it's<00:04:43.490> just

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
you've got it supported by it's just

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.120 
you've got it supported by it's just
worded<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.180> yeah<00:04:44.600> it's<00:04:45.050> because<00:04:45.440> these<00:04:45.830> hands

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
worded but yeah it's because these hands

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.380 
worded but yeah it's because these hands
it<00:04:46.280> had<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.550> be<00:04:46.669> pretend<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.090> be<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.300> they

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
it had to be pretend to be so they

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.360 
it had to be pretend to be so they
connect<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.870> buttress<00:04:48.260> it's<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.680> buttress<00:04:48.919> yes

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
connect and buttress it's a buttress yes

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.860 
connect and buttress it's a buttress yes
and<00:04:49.580> it's<00:04:49.669> how<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:50.150> isn't<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.600> prime<00:04:50.840> example

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
and it's how this isn't a prime example

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.290 
and it's how this isn't a prime example
of<00:04:51.470> how<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:52.310> piece<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:52.640> paper<00:04:52.820> makes<00:04:53.150> that

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
of how this piece of paper makes that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.709 
of how this piece of paper makes that
piece<00:04:53.479> of<00:04:53.630> paper<00:04:53.750> positive

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
piece of paper positive

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.929 
piece of paper positive
and<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.469> of<00:04:55.979> course<00:04:56.159> and<00:04:56.610> then<00:04:56.729> when<00:04:56.849> they

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
and and of course and then when they

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.179 
and and of course and then when they
come<00:04:57.089> in<00:04:57.269> here<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:58.019> took<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.229> long<00:04:58.439> time<00:04:58.469> to<00:04:58.739> keep

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
come in here it took a long time to keep

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.429 
come in here it took a long time to keep
these<00:04:59.459> two<00:04:59.999> spires<00:05:00.389> from<00:05:00.779> banging<00:05:01.169> into<00:05:01.409> each

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
these two spires from banging into each

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.289 
these two spires from banging into each
other<00:05:01.739> what's<00:05:02.309> the<00:05:02.459> exact<00:05:02.759> we're<00:05:03.059> going<00:05:03.179> to<00:05:03.239> do

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.189 
look like that you can't decide that the
tower<00:05:34.319> is<00:05:34.529> gonna<00:05:34.769> be<00:05:34.919> over<00:05:35.129> there<00:05:36.199> they've

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
tower is gonna be over there they've

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.019 
tower is gonna be over there they've
already<00:05:37.619> no<00:05:37.860> word<00:05:38.039> where<00:05:38.399> the<00:05:38.429> tower<00:05:38.669> is

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
already no word where the tower is

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.229 
already no word where the tower is
you<00:05:39.539> can't<00:05:39.779> do<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.429> so<00:05:41.429> it<00:05:41.939> makes<00:05:42.089> it<00:05:42.149> very

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:42.239 
you can't do that so it makes it very

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.239 
you can't do that so it makes it very
difficult<00:05:42.569> buildings<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.469> think<00:05:43.860> buildings

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:44.249 
difficult buildings I think buildings

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:45.559 
difficult buildings I think buildings
are<00:05:44.339> the<00:05:44.429> most<00:05:44.579> difficult<00:05:45.119> thing<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.389> pop

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
are the most difficult thing to pop

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.629 
are the most difficult thing to pop
because<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.499> that<00:05:46.709> because<00:05:47.009> of<00:05:47.219> that<00:05:47.339> you<00:05:47.610> have

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
because of that because of that you have

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.109 
because of that because of that you have
to<00:05:48.769> make<00:05:49.769> the<00:05:50.009> building<00:05:50.429> look<00:05:50.699> the<00:05:50.879> way<00:05:50.999> the

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:51.119 
to make the building look the way the

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:52.339 
to make the building look the way the
building<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.419> supposed<00:05:51.569> to<00:05:51.719> look<00:05:51.869> like<00:05:51.929> and

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
building is supposed to look like and

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.529 
building is supposed to look like and
still<00:05:52.559> make<00:05:52.739> it<00:05:52.860> look<00:05:52.889> more<00:05:53.429> as<00:05:53.579> a<00:05:53.610> pop-up<00:05:53.849> and

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
still make it look more as a pop-up and

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.809 
still make it look more as a pop-up and
sometimes<00:05:54.959> it<00:05:55.169> just<00:05:55.289> doesn't<00:05:55.439> work<00:05:55.819> sometimes

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
sometimes it just doesn't work sometimes

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.059 
sometimes it just doesn't work sometimes
I<00:05:56.939> get<00:05:57.089> a<00:05:57.119> project<00:05:57.509> for<00:05:57.599> a<00:05:57.659> building<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.619> I<00:05:58.829> go

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
I get a project for a building and I go

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.499 
I get a project for a building and I go
I<00:05:59.339> go<00:06:01.279> there's<00:06:02.279> no<00:06:02.429> way<00:06:02.459> is<00:06:03.179> that<00:06:03.389> this

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
I go there's no way is that this

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.239 
I go there's no way is that this
building<00:06:03.749> is<00:06:03.929> not<00:06:03.989> palpable<00:06:04.499> go<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:04.949> plan<00:06:05.219> B

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:05.249 
building is not palpable go to plan B

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:06.829 
building is not palpable go to plan B
somebody'll<00:06:06.119> subject<00:06:06.479> ya

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
somebody'll subject ya

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.309 
somebody'll subject ya
you<00:06:06.929> can't<00:06:07.229> this<00:06:07.589> building<00:06:08.069> cannot<00:06:08.729> be<00:06:08.999> popped

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
you can't this building cannot be popped

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.169 
you can't this building cannot be popped
as<00:06:10.319> far<00:06:10.529> as<00:06:10.589> I<00:06:10.709> can<00:06:10.889> I'm<00:06:11.399> concerned<00:06:11.789> there's

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:12.179 
as far as I can I'm concerned there's

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:14.089 
as far as I can I'm concerned there's
there's<00:06:12.839> no<00:06:12.989> structures<00:06:13.649> in<00:06:13.829> the<00:06:13.949> right

places especially with modern sculpt a
modern<00:06:16.860> architecture<00:06:17.369> there's<00:06:18.059> a<00:06:18.179> lot<00:06:18.360> of

modern architecture there's a lot of

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.009 
modern architecture there's a lot of

has<00:06:24.899> to<00:06:24.929> have<00:06:25.439> something<00:06:25.860> lifting<00:06:26.639> it<00:06:26.819> when<00:06:27.269> in

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
has to have something lifting it when in

has to have something lifting it when in
reality<00:06:27.539> for<00:06:28.259> us<00:06:28.289> architecture<00:06:29.069> doesn't<00:06:29.339> have

reality for us architecture doesn't have
to<00:06:29.819> have<00:06:29.999> that<00:06:30.179> there's<00:06:30.419> a<00:06:30.509> thing<00:06:31.319> doing<00:06:31.559> this

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
to have that there's a thing doing this

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.339 
to have that there's a thing doing this
it's<00:06:32.189> floating<00:06:32.489> over<00:06:32.729> space<00:06:33.149> pop<00:06:33.989> up<00:06:34.139> has<00:06:34.319> to

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
it's floating over space pop up has to

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.769 
it's floating over space pop up has to
have<00:06:34.589> something<00:06:34.769> up<00:06:34.979> there<00:06:35.129> holding<00:06:35.489> it

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
have something up there holding it

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.999 
have something up there holding it
sometimes<00:06:36.779> you<00:06:36.869> get<00:06:37.050> around<00:06:37.349> that<00:06:37.589> because

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
sometimes you get around that because

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.799 
sometimes you get around that because
you<00:06:38.219> can<00:06:38.369> put<00:06:38.550> trees<00:06:38.879> and<00:06:39.209> stuff<00:06:39.389> in<00:06:39.509> the<00:06:39.599> trees

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:39.809 
you can put trees and stuff in the trees

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.179 
you can put trees and stuff in the trees
become<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.229> thing<00:06:40.409> I<00:06:40.469> pushed<00:06:40.739> it<00:06:40.860> up<00:06:41.009> and

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
become the thing I pushed it up and

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:44.089 
become the thing I pushed it up and
stuff<00:06:41.339> but<00:06:42.379> there<00:06:43.379> aren't<00:06:43.499> any<00:06:43.559> trees<00:06:43.829> right

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
stuff but there aren't any trees right

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.819
