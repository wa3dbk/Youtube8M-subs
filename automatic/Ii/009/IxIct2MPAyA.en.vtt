the<00:00:16.619> I've<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.220> kicked<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> deep<00:00:17.880> preamp

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the I've just kicked up the deep preamp

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.800 
the I've just kicked up the deep preamp
to<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:18.840> seven<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.410> slightly<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
to about seven just slightly up and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.700 
to about seven just slightly up and
otherwise<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.109> pretty<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
otherwise it's pretty much about the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
otherwise it's pretty much about the
same<00:00:22.800> that's<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.460> common<00:00:23.760> set<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
same that's just a common set for the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.070 
same that's just a common set for the
lhari<00:00:24.449> output<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> strat<00:00:26.029> pickups<00:00:27.080> so

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
lhari output of the strat pickups so

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.460 
lhari output of the strat pickups so
just<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> clean<00:00:29.720> yeah<00:00:30.720> clean<00:00:31.080> straight

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
which i really like middle pickup pretty

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
which i really like middle pickup pretty
big

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
okay this time with a bit of gain I'm

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.420 
okay this time with a bit of gain I'm
going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.030> use<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.450> an<00:03:48.110> AC<00:03:48.319> booster<00:03:48.709> xotic

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
going to use a an AC booster xotic

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.449 
going to use a an AC booster xotic
pedals<00:03:49.549> AC<00:03:49.879> booster<00:03:50.209> which<00:03:50.569> is<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> kind<00:03:50.959> of

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
pedals AC booster which is a kind of

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.130 
pedals AC booster which is a kind of
it's<00:03:52.459> almost<00:03:52.670> like<00:03:52.879> farce<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.750> very<00:03:53.959> light

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
it's almost like farce it's a very light

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.839 
it's almost like farce it's a very light
fast<00:03:54.440> though<00:03:54.620> it's<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.860> low<00:03:55.010> gain<00:03:55.250> pedal<00:03:55.670> or

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
fast though it's a low gain pedal or

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.240 
fast though it's a low gain pedal or
medium<00:03:56.180> gain<00:03:56.360> pedal<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:58.040> may<00:03:58.190> be

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
medium gain pedal and it may be

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.979 
medium gain pedal and it may be
germanium<00:03:58.849> based<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.209> don't<00:03:59.540> actually<00:03:59.690> know

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
germanium based I don't actually know

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.069 
germanium based I don't actually know
but<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.489> is<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.549> very<00:04:01.640> nice<00:04:01.970> sounding<00:04:02.720> pedal

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
but it's is a very nice sounding pedal
