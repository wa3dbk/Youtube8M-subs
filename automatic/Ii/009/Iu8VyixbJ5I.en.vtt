they<00:01:19.270> play<00:01:19.540> their<00:01:19.750> creature<00:01:20.190> through<00:01:21.190> an<00:01:21.460> epic

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
they play their creature through an epic

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.450 
they play their creature through an epic
scope<00:01:22.060> from<00:01:22.450> tide<00:01:23.170> pool<00:01:23.440> all<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.980> way<00:01:24.100> through

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
scope from tide pool all the way through

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.300 
scope from tide pool all the way through
making<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.000> tribe<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.720> then<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.080> cities<00:01:26.980> and<00:01:27.280> a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
making a tribe and then a cities and a

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.190 
making a tribe and then a cities and a
civilization<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.240> ultimately<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.840> space

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
civilization and ultimately to space

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.480 
civilization and ultimately to space
travel<00:01:29.440> what<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:29.950> think<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.250> most

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
travel what I think it's most

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.850 
travel what I think it's most
interesting<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.600> can<00:01:31.870> build<00:01:32.590> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
interesting is that you can build a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.110 
interesting is that you can build a
fully<00:01:33.340> animated<00:01:33.970> creature<00:01:35.550> and/or<00:01:36.550> spaceship

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
fully animated creature and/or spaceship

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.520 
fully animated creature and/or spaceship
without<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.810> knowing<00:01:38.050> anything<00:01:38.350> about

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
without really knowing anything about

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.010 
without really knowing anything about
animation<00:01:39.220> maybe<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:39.970> describe<00:01:40.090> how<00:01:40.630> how

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
animation maybe you can describe how how

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.190 
animation maybe you can describe how how
you<00:01:41.080> guys<00:01:41.320> put<00:01:42.040> that<00:01:42.220> powerful<00:01:43.200> ability

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
you guys put that powerful ability

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.230 
you guys put that powerful ability
within<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> game<00:01:44.740> yeah<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> technology

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
within the game yeah so the technology

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.940 
within the game yeah so the technology
describing<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.200> called<00:01:47.470> procedural

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
describing is called procedural

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.560 
describing is called procedural
animation<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.820> what<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.120> means<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.540> no

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
animation and what that means is no

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.719 
animation and what that means is no
matter<00:01:49.720> what<00:01:50.110> crazy<00:01:50.440> creature<00:01:50.799> or<00:01:51.190> other<00:01:51.370> item

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
matter what crazy creature or other item

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.550 
matter what crazy creature or other item
you<00:01:51.880> make<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.600> gamble<00:01:52.930> figure<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.320> how<00:01:53.500> it

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
you make the gamble figure out how it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.500 
you make the gamble figure out how it
would<00:01:53.799> move<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.250> how<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.400> will<00:01:54.549> behave<00:01:54.670> for

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
would move and how it will behave for

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.840 
would move and how it will behave for
example<00:01:55.900> with<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.110> creature<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.799> this<00:01:57.729> is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
example with this creature here this is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750 
example with this creature here this is
something<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.270> we've<00:01:58.840> made<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.610> game

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
something that we've made and the game

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.580 
something that we've made and the game
will<00:02:00.909> figure<00:02:01.090> out<00:02:01.299> how<00:02:01.510> it<00:02:01.570> moves<00:02:01.900> simply<00:02:02.440> hi

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
will figure out how it moves simply hi

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.800 
will figure out how it moves simply hi
it<00:02:02.650> walks<00:02:02.950> around<00:02:03.310> but<00:02:04.000> then<00:02:04.150> beyond<00:02:04.720> that

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it walks around but then beyond that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.630 
it walks around but then beyond that
