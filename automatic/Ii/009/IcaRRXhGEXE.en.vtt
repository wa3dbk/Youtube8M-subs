00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 ju today I'm doing something after what 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.450
 myself on a youtube channel 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.420
 seen from a tip of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 someone from the known from facebook like that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 I make now only 22 apples 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:30.380
 out of that I'm proud to do now only 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.640
 then a lemon outside colored here 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 that is so unwieldy now 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.219
 I'll do that later and then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.710
 a few things are mixed together 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:50.489
 I'm going to take either nuts 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:58.559
 oatmeal raisins coconut oil honey and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:00.059
 cinnamon is equal to the nuts 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.210
 I have oatmeal raisins now 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.159
 ever a bowl the people 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.280
 I have small data now 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 I now also give them a cut 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 then honey comes to coconut oil and are 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 then it gets mixed up with accurate information 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.890
 come later oven is already on 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.740
 penultimate 190 degrees 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.200
 so now i have everything inside 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.610
 on top 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.479
 It is now confused so the mass of you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.369
 then plug it into the apples 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:45.680
 so and the come now for 20 minutes 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.680
 in the oven when the hiker was 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.259
 this mass until the same 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.880
 so you are just out of the oven 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.560
 brought 20 minutes 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.509
 I'm spontaneous now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.109
 decided to go over it mandl must 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.109
 to tip over it 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:19.379
 that looks like that could then be coded out 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.069
 really bad marks then come here so 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:34.190
 the ingredients of the apples 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:41.209
 There were 560 calories circa 14 95 g 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:46.940
 carbohydrates and 7.1 really tastes good 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.940
 hammered out try it out
