lot<00:01:57.969> of<00:01:57.999> sections<00:01:58.539> I<00:01:58.780> think<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.109> was<00:01:59.229> only

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
lot of sections I think it was only

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.879 
lot of sections I think it was only
maybe<00:02:00.159> three<00:02:00.490> or<00:02:00.520> four<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.380> then<00:02:02.409> when<00:02:02.859> I

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
maybe three or four and then when I

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.260 
maybe three or four and then when I
reach<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.520> bottom<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:05.469> split<00:02:06.429> my<00:02:06.759> three

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
reach the bottom I split my three

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.050 
reach the bottom I split my three
sections<00:02:07.810> into<00:02:08.770> two<00:02:08.979> sections<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.759> split

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
sections into two sections and split

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.050 
sections into two sections and split
each<00:02:10.240> of<00:02:10.390> those<00:02:10.539> into<00:02:11.020> three<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.160> have<00:02:12.700> two

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.500 
start with two that go into one and I
think<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.049> fun

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
think it's kind of fun

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.309 
think it's kind of fun
one<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.440> branches<00:02:27.950> into<00:02:28.159> two<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.989> had<00:02:30.170> to

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
one that branches into two but we had to

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.199 
one that branches into two but we had to
branch<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> into<00:02:30.920> two<00:02:31.129> because<00:02:31.970> we're<00:02:32.120> going

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
branch it into two because we're going

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.390 
branch it into two because we're going
to<00:02:32.299> take<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.290> wrap<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.560> around<00:02:33.920> our
