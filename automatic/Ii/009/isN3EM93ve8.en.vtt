00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160 

I<00:00:00.240> think<00:00:01.140> that<00:00:01.650> our<00:00:02.010> our<00:00:02.939> main<00:00:03.240> problem<00:00:03.959> as

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I think that our our main problem as

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.519 
I think that our our main problem as
human<00:00:05.130> beings<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.720> stage

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
human beings is that we are in a stage

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.970 
human beings is that we are in a stage
of<00:00:07.859> evolution<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.719> we're<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:10.019> an<00:00:10.200> adolescent

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of evolution and we're in an adolescent

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.730 
of evolution and we're in an adolescent
stage<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.210> certainly<00:00:12.660> passing<00:00:13.530> where

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
stage and we are certainly passing where

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.680 
stage and we are certainly passing where
we<00:00:13.860> used<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.549> our<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.910> our<00:00:15.059> potential

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
we used to be and our just our potential

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.859 
we used to be and our just our potential
for<00:00:16.199> evolving<00:00:16.830> above<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.550> basic<00:00:18.330> fight<00:00:18.660> or

these things that we think that we need
in<00:00:27.359> order<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> compete<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.560> survive<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.670> have

in order to compete and survive we have

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.510 
in order to compete and survive we have
potential<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> rise<00:00:31.109> above<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.980> that's

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
potential to rise above that and that's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
potential to rise above that and that's
what<00:00:32.820> yoga<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:34.620> what

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
about is this this struggle up this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080 
about is this this struggle up this
slippery<00:00:45.660> slope<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> top<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.910> have

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
slippery slope to get to the top to have

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.170 
slippery slope to get to the top to have
just<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.989> better<00:00:49.500> view<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
just a little better view of what the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
just a little better view of what the
world<00:00:51.420> could<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.370> that's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
world could be and I think that that's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
world could be and I think that that's
what<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.739> potential<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
what that's the the potential that we

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
what that's the the potential that we
have<00:00:56.640> inside<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> us<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.930> moving

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
have inside of us it's all moving

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.160 
have inside of us it's all moving

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
towards that you know human

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
towards that you know human
understanding<00:01:01.379> human<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.550> idea<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> human

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
understanding human the idea of human

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
understanding human the idea of human
enlightenment<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> quest

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
enlightenment you know this this quest

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
enlightenment you know this this quest
to<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.850> shit<00:01:06.150> together<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:07.170> all

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to get your shit together it's all

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.399 
to get your shit together it's all
moving<00:01:08.220> away<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:09.409> nonsensical

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
moving away from these nonsensical

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.460 
moving away from these nonsensical
animal<00:01:11.220> instincts<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.360> something<00:01:13.080> higher<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
animal instincts to something higher and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.910 
animal instincts to something higher and
more<00:01:14.040> evolved<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.259> potential

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
more evolved and I think that potential

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
more evolved and I think that potential
is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> human<00:01:19.020> beings

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is the only good thing that human beings

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.620 
is the only good thing that human beings
have<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.150> potential

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
have it's like we have this potential

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
have it's like we have this potential
for<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.830> side<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
for one side of the other we have this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
for one side of the other we have this
potential<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.740> an
