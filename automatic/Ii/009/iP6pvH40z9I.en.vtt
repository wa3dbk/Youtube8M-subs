get<00:02:13.499> up<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:14.129> it<00:02:14.760> goes<00:02:15.030> straight<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.569> as<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
get up now it goes straight down as you

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.959 
get up now it goes straight down as you
can<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.920> exhaust<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.849> goes

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
can see this is exhaust just goes

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.910 
can see this is exhaust just goes
straight<00:02:18.150> down<00:02:18.329> its<00:02:19.079> overhead<00:02:19.469> valve<00:02:19.709> engine

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
straight down its overhead valve engine

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.729 
straight down its overhead valve engine
just<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.700> Honda<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.530> starts

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
just like the Honda and this one starts

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.339 
just like the Honda and this one starts
up<00:02:22.980> pretty<00:02:23.189> good<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.670> very<00:02:24.510> comfy<00:02:24.900> seat<00:02:25.109> pretty

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
big I'm kind of angry that there's no

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.929 
big I'm kind of angry that there's no
suspension<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.489> there<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.760> one

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
suspension on the back but there is one

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.399 
suspension on the back but there is one
on<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> front<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.659> it's<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.319> really

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
on the front so it's really it's really

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.129 
on the front so it's really it's really
bumpy<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:32.099> ride<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:33.209> grip<00:02:33.510> gets<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> little

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
bumpy to ride this grip gets a little

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.899 
bumpy to ride this grip gets a little
hurt<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.650> hurts<00:02:34.859> your<00:02:34.980> hand<00:02:35.159> after<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> while<00:02:35.700> so

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
hurt it hurts your hand after a while so

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.360 
hurt it hurts your hand after a while so
I<00:02:35.969> wear<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.450> glove<00:02:37.109> on<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.409> right<00:02:37.620> hand<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.129> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I wear a glove on my right hand and the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.789 
I wear a glove on my right hand and the
turning<00:02:38.700> radius<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.329> that<00:02:39.510> good<00:02:39.799> but

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
turning radius is not that good but

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.649 
turning radius is not that good but
that's<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.790> only<00:02:41.819> negatives<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.480> have

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
that's that's the only negatives I have

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.500 
that's that's the only negatives I have
about<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.139> the<00:02:44.040> fuel<00:02:44.249> tank<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.609> what<00:02:45.120> probably

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
about it the fuel tank is what probably

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.770 
about it the fuel tank is what probably
the<00:02:45.840> normal<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:46.530> gallon<00:02:46.919> Honda<00:02:47.310> sighs<00:02:47.780> maybe

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the normal one gallon Honda sighs maybe

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.259 
the normal one gallon Honda sighs maybe
that<00:02:49.379> might<00:02:49.469> be<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> gallon<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.790> make<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.150> go

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
that might be a gallon to make it go

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.750 
that might be a gallon to make it go
faster<00:02:51.750> there's<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> screw<00:02:52.919> right<00:02:52.949> there<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
faster there's a screw right there you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
faster there's a screw right there you
can<00:02:53.939> see<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.419> you<00:02:55.109> twist<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.590> lefty

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
can see it and you twist that lefty

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.729 
can see it and you twist that lefty
loosey<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.939> will<00:02:57.419> make<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.719> go<00:02:57.840> faster<00:02:58.349> for<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
loosey it will make it go faster for you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.740 
loosey it will make it go faster for you
and<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.269> have<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.629> do

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and that's so you don't have to do

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.330 
and that's so you don't have to do
anything<00:03:00.959> with<00:03:01.199> the<00:03:01.290> governor<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.859> then<00:03:02.219> you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
anything with the governor and then you

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.920 
anything with the governor and then you
can<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.579> twist<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:02.969> back<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.510> ever<00:03:03.689> breaks

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
can just twist it back if it ever breaks

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.530 
can just twist it back if it ever breaks
and<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.319> need<00:03:04.500> return<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.159> have<00:03:06.000> no<00:03:06.239> clue

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
and you need return it I have no clue

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.330 
and you need return it I have no clue
what<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.930> thing<00:03:07.199> is<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.620> has<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:07.949> a<00:03:08.010> tube

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
what this thing is this has like a tube

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.970 
what this thing is this has like a tube
and<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.209> goes<00:03:09.419> up<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.689> this<00:03:09.780> circular<00:03:10.469> thing<00:03:10.769> I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
and it goes up to this circular thing I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.909 
and it goes up to this circular thing I
think<00:03:11.219> it's<00:03:11.310> some<00:03:11.489> kind<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:12.290> has<00:03:13.290> water<00:03:13.620> at<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
think it's some kind of has water at the

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.289 
think it's some kind of has water at the
bottom<00:03:14.219> of<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.549> think<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:14.939> some<00:03:15.090> kind<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
bottom of it I think it's some kind of

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.020 
bottom of it I think it's some kind of
water<00:03:15.480> separator<00:03:16.049> maybe<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.010> fuel<00:03:17.280> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
water separator maybe on the fuel it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.030 
water separator maybe on the fuel it
goes<00:03:18.239> from<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.540> valves<00:03:18.959> into<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.650> then

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
goes from the valves into it and then

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520 
goes from the valves into it and then
back<00:03:20.849> into<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.239> carburetor<00:03:21.689> of<00:03:22.079> airbox

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
back into the carburetor of airbox

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
back into the carburetor of airbox
airbox<00:03:23.340> goes<00:03:23.669> back<00:03:23.849> into<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> air<00:03:24.269> box<00:03:24.419> I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
airbox goes back into the air box I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.530 
airbox goes back into the air box I
think<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.099> separate<00:03:26.669> takes<00:03:27.060> moisture

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
think that the separate takes moisture

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.490 
think that the separate takes moisture
out<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.689> the<00:03:28.879> oil<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.150> rips<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.019> into<00:03:31.109> here

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
out of the oil and rips it into here

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.199 
out of the oil and rips it into here
I've<00:03:32.159> never<00:03:32.400> seen<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.759> before

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
I've never seen that before

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.020 
I've never seen that before
that's<00:03:33.569> pretty<00:03:33.810> weird-looking<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.650> need

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
that's pretty weird-looking you need

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.759 
that's pretty weird-looking you need
here's<00:03:36.030> your<00:03:36.180> brake<00:03:36.389> assembly<00:03:37.019> band<00:03:37.259> brake<00:03:37.530> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
here's your brake assembly band brake it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.550 
here's your brake assembly band brake it
looks<00:03:37.949> like<00:03:38.509> but<00:03:39.509> yeah<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.049> not<00:03:40.169> gonna<00:03:40.319> drive

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
looks like but yeah I'm not gonna drive

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.289 
looks like but yeah I'm not gonna drive
it<00:03:40.739> for<00:03:40.919> you<00:03:41.009> guys<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:41.430> got<00:03:41.579> reflectors<00:03:42.090> right

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
it for you guys you got reflectors right

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.580 
it for you guys you got reflectors right
here<00:03:42.479> I'll<00:03:42.629> we'll<00:03:42.840> start<00:03:43.139> it<00:03:43.259> up<00:03:43.349> though

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
here I'll we'll start it up though

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.170 
here I'll we'll start it up though
hasn't<00:03:44.459> been<00:03:44.549> started<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.060> three<00:03:45.329> days<00:03:45.599> so<00:03:47.180> we

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
hasn't been started in three days so we

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.409 
hasn't been started in three days so we
can<00:03:48.359> turn<00:03:48.689> that<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.019> choke<00:03:49.970> feels<00:03:50.970> already<00:03:51.329> on

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
can turn that to choke feels already on

00:03:53.419 --> 00:04:44.060 
can turn that to choke feels already on
here

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.980 

it<00:04:44.460> does<00:04:44.670> have<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> nice<00:04:45.150> engine<00:04:45.420> though<00:04:47.990> those

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
it does have a nice engine though those

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.060 
it does have a nice engine though those
have<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.200> nice<00:04:49.350> engine<00:04:49.650> note

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
have a nice engine note
