into a potential predator and hope that

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.139 
into a potential predator and hope that
that<00:01:54.110> will<00:01:54.229> make<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.649> animal<00:01:55.040> go<00:01:55.189> away<00:01:55.399> I'm

on her back end so you can see the long

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.270 
on her back end so you can see the long
one<00:02:02.329> sticking<00:02:02.659> up<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.110> then<00:02:03.740> she's<00:02:04.070> got

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
one sticking up and then she's got

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.410 
one sticking up and then she's got
shorter<00:02:04.850> but<00:02:05.509> still<00:02:05.840> pretty<00:02:06.229> long<00:02:06.560> ones<00:02:06.860> lying

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
shorter but still pretty long ones lying

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.860 
shorter but still pretty long ones lying
backwards<00:02:09.459> good<00:02:10.459> girl<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.420> now<00:02:11.599> we're<00:02:11.750> all

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
backwards good girl and now we're all

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.440 
backwards good girl and now we're all
flared<00:02:12.170> up<00:02:12.319> because<00:02:12.500> we're<00:02:12.620> all<00:02:12.739> excited

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
flared up because we're all excited

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.100 
flared up because we're all excited
let's<00:02:14.450> show<00:02:14.599> off<00:02:14.629> some<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.900> your<00:02:14.989> other

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
let's show off some of your other

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
let's show off some of your other
behavior

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
behavior

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.980 
behavior
stand<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:20.120> one's<00:02:20.300> pretty<00:02:20.450> much<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:20.900> fun<00:02:22.990> she

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
stand that one's pretty much for fun she

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.510 
stand that one's pretty much for fun she
could<00:02:24.200> stand<00:02:24.530> against<00:02:24.950> something<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
could stand against something in the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.170 
could stand against something in the
wild<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:27.500> gonna<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.150> behavior<00:02:29.150> to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
wild but not not gonna be a behavior to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.300 
wild but not not gonna be a behavior to
keep<00:02:29.390> herself<00:02:29.510> safe<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.830> come<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> zoo

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
keep herself safe if you come to the zoo

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.150 
keep herself safe if you come to the zoo
you<00:02:34.730> might<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:35.240> Kumari<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.840> our<00:02:36.050> shows<00:02:36.500> or<00:02:36.920> out

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
you might see Kumari in our shows or out

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.250 
you might see Kumari in our shows or out
on<00:02:37.190> back<00:02:37.970> animal<00:02:38.870> discoveries<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.930> she<00:02:42.110> does

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
on back animal discoveries but she does

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.570 
on back animal discoveries but she does
live<00:02:42.440> behind<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:43.070> scenes

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.300 

another<00:02:46.580> reason<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.000> train<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
another reason to train is to have the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.870 
another reason to train is to have the
animal<00:02:49.810> participate<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.990> their<00:02:51.170> own<00:02:51.200> care<00:02:51.880> so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
animal participate in their own care so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.150 
animal participate in their own care so
she<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.270> trained<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> go<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.320> crate<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.040> we

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
she is trained to go in a crate so we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.280 
she is trained to go in a crate so we
can<00:02:55.340> safely<00:02:55.580> service<00:02:56.060> her<00:02:56.180> enclosure<00:02:56.420> closure

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
can safely service her enclosure closure

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.500 
can safely service her enclosure closure
station<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.770> trained<00:03:01.100> her<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.580> let<00:03:02.180> me

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
station and I have trained her to let me

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.240 
station and I have trained her to let me
touch<00:03:02.720> her<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:03.950> get<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.070> physical

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
touch her so I can get a physical

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:15.840 
touch her so I can get a physical
examination<00:03:04.760> from<00:03:05.390> RIT<00:03:05.600> touch<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.630> girl<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
examination from RIT touch the girl and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.850 
examination from RIT touch the girl and
that<00:03:16.850> touch<00:03:17.060> behavior<00:03:17.630> has<00:03:17.900> recently<00:03:18.410> led<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
that touch behavior has recently led to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.000 
that touch behavior has recently led to
us<00:03:19.040> training<00:03:19.730> her<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.630> voluntary<00:03:21.230> injections

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
us training her for voluntary injections

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.910 
us training her for voluntary injections
so<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.210> built<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.630> little<00:03:23.780> chute<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.560> she<00:03:24.770> can

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
so we built a little chute that she can

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.460 
so we built a little chute that she can
walk<00:03:25.100> into<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.820> her<00:03:25.970> enclosure<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.260> hooks

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
walk into in her enclosure and it hooks

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.100 
walk into in her enclosure and it hooks
onto<00:03:27.680> her<00:03:27.920> fence<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.420> essentially<00:03:30.080> just

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
onto her fence so that essentially just

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.800 
onto her fence so that essentially just
gets<00:03:30.440> her<00:03:30.650> near<00:03:30.890> her<00:03:31.100> fence<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:32.570> can<00:03:32.780> I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
gets her near her fence then we can I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.200 
gets her near her fence then we can I
asked<00:03:33.230> her<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.710> touch<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:35.000> then<00:03:36.040> a

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
asked her to a touch and then a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.020 
asked her to a touch and then a
veterinarian<00:03:38.210> can<00:03:38.540> anesthetize<00:03:39.470> her<00:03:40.030> through

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
veterinarian can anesthetize her through

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.740 
veterinarian can anesthetize her through
the<00:03:41.210> fence<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:43.640> makes<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.060> very<00:03:44.120> very

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
the fence and that makes it very very

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.410 
the fence and that makes it very very
low<00:03:45.080> stress<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:46.070> we<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.550> do<00:03:46.670> examinations

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
low stress if we have to do examinations

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.530 
low stress if we have to do examinations
where<00:03:47.630> she<00:03:47.750> has<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.140> be<00:03:48.260> asleep
