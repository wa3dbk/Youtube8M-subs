to give you guys a just simple sort of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
to give you guys a just simple sort of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
plan - for putting screws in one that's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.850 
plan - for putting screws in one that's
going<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.209> maximize<00:00:15.419> your<00:00:16.020> safety<00:00:16.410> basically

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
going to maximize your safety basically

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.700 
going to maximize your safety basically
right<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.610> can<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.260> you'll

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
right you can do some things and you'll

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.840 
right you can do some things and you'll
probably<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:20.130> away<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.310> them<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:20.730> while

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
probably get away with them for a while

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.460 
probably get away with them for a while
but<00:00:21.150> there's<00:00:21.720> other<00:00:21.870> things<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.290> do

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
but there's other things you can do

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
but there's other things you can do
which<00:00:22.860> are<00:00:23.040> just<00:00:23.220> safer<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:24.470> because<00:00:25.470> they

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
which are just safer and because they

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.110 
which are just safer and because they
are<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.190> it<00:00:26.280> doesn't<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.580> any<00:00:26.610> more<00:00:26.880> time

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
are and it doesn't take any more time

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.210 
are and it doesn't take any more time
and<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.530> learn<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:28.920> things<00:00:29.100> from

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and you want to learn these things from

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
and you want to learn these things from
the<00:00:29.400> beginning<00:00:29.850> so<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> lot<00:00:30.780> of<00:00:30.810> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the beginning so you have a lot of that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.740 
the beginning so you have a lot of that
redundancy<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:31.680> just<00:00:31.980> built<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.430> okay<00:00:33.059> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
redundancy much just built in okay so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
redundancy much just built in okay so
when<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.930> climb<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.320> aways<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.010> scared

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

beginning<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.340> I'm<00:01:53.430> gonna<00:01:53.550> take<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:53.910> spike<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
beginning so I'm gonna take my spike and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600 
beginning so I'm gonna take my spike and
make<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.350> starter<00:01:55.800> hole<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.980> found<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.460> my

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
make my starter hole I found that my

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910 
make my starter hole I found that my
spike<00:01:56.940> works<00:01:57.150> better<00:01:57.390> than<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.660> pick<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
spike works better than my pick this for

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.470 
spike works better than my pick this for
some<00:01:59.100> reason<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.700> tend<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.970> shatter<00:02:00.210> more

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
some reason I just tend to shatter more

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.730 
some reason I just tend to shatter more
with<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.720> pick<00:02:01.310> take<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.490> spike<00:02:03.500> I'm<00:02:04.500> just

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
with my pick take my spike I'm just

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.490 
with my pick take my spike I'm just
hitting<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> same<00:02:05.370> spot<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> grab<00:02:09.899> my<00:02:10.110> screw

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
hitting the same spot and grab my screw

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.670 
hitting the same spot and grab my screw
I'll<00:02:10.830> rewrite<00:02:11.780> I'm<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:13.140> sketching<00:02:13.650> here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I'll rewrite I'm really sketching here

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'll rewrite I'm really sketching here
so<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> my<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.330> tiny

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so I'm gonna use one of my little tiny

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.070 
so I'm gonna use one of my little tiny
ones<00:02:15.950> cuz<00:02:16.950> they're<00:02:17.100> easy<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.490> get<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:20.960> put<00:02:21.960> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
ones cuz they're easy to get in put it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080 
ones cuz they're easy to get in put it
put<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.560> at<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.860> right<00:02:22.980> angle<00:02:23.040> tilt<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.820> up<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
put it at the right angle tilt it up a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.200 
put it at the right angle tilt it up a
little<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.480> maybe<00:02:24.750> 10-15<00:02:25.440> degrees<00:02:25.560> from<00:02:26.210> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
little bit maybe 10-15 degrees from the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.240 
little bit maybe 10-15 degrees from the
surface<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> ice<00:02:28.400> get<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.550> turned<00:02:31.250> push

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
surface of the ice get it turned push

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.850 
surface of the ice get it turned push
and<00:02:32.820> try<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.320> turn<00:02:34.560> in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and try to get as much of a turn in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.620 
and try to get as much of a turn in
while<00:02:35.100> I'm<00:02:35.220> pushing<00:02:35.460> for<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> first<00:02:36.420> one

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
while I'm pushing for the first one

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.620 
while I'm pushing for the first one
because<00:02:36.960> then<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.010> bites<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:39.360> take<00:02:39.510> my

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
okay

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.950 
okay
because<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.790> hardest<00:03:59.150> part<00:03:59.360> about<00:03:59.420> climbing

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
because the hardest part about climbing

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.510 
because the hardest part about climbing
ice<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.320> really<00:04:00.590> not<00:04:00.710> climbing<00:04:01.160> ice<00:04:01.280> it's

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
ice is really not climbing ice it's

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.900 
ice is really not climbing ice it's
putting<00:04:01.790> these<00:04:01.970> things<00:04:02.240> in<00:04:02.860> okay<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.670> takes

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
putting these things in okay so it takes

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.190 
putting these things in okay so it takes
a<00:04:05.030> lot<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.180> practice<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:07.810> these<00:04:08.810> little

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
a lot of practice and these little

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.700 
a lot of practice and these little
tricks<00:04:09.470> will<00:04:09.680> take<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> long<00:04:10.040> way<00:04:11.710> that's

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
tricks will take you a long way that's

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:32.920 
tricks will take you a long way that's
good<00:04:13.010> enough<00:04:13.480> anyway<00:04:29.590> you'll<00:04:30.590> find<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.930> this
