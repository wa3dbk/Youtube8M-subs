00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello lovely in case you do not know me 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 I call Raquel, although it's harder for me to go out 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.170
 and today I'll teach you to make a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 kawaii super simple hairstyles and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.019
 quick for the return to class so 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.019
 let's start 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.850
 the first is super simple and is the one 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.970
 I liked it more and the truth is that 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.220
 it is very beautiful and elegant 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.740
 you're going to do is pick up a section of 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.590
 half of the head and you're going to take it 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.450
 to the opposite side 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.970
 and then in that whole section you're going to go 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 spinning as you see there you will catch 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.410
 small strands and he's going to throw them 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 turning back all the lock itself 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.379
 and then when you have it in the other 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.300
 What you're going to do is tie it up with 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.750
 a fork and put a bow what 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.750
 you want 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.969
 and it would be like that the truth is that to me 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.969
 he liked this hairstyle a lot 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 dt 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.520
 the second hairstyle is the simplest 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.829
 all and if you are sure that per capo 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.899
 you 've seen a lot of idols and 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.939
 it is simply to make a ponytail in the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.920
 top of the head towards a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.469
 side with a rubber band you take a section 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 small and smart and the truth is that it is 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.600
 very simple but it gives you a touch 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.430
 different for day to day 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.430
 it is simply more 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.649
 dt 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.619
 and we go with the third hairstyle this is 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.329
 two pigtails but a little different if 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.610
 You have shorter hair than I think 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.610
 it will be much better just you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 you make two low pigtails and now we're going to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 braid like a normal braid and when 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.899
 we already have enough without tying the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.299
 nothing is not necessary we are going to make a knot 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.619
 if a knot even if you do not worry 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.619
 then it is removed super easy 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.020
 subject the knot there and covering the gomita 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.950
 attach it with a fork so it does not 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.729
 fall and ready would be like that the queue 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.729
 more short 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.170
 that is super simple and very comfortable 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170
