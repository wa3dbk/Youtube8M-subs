 indy formula in this last test of the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.680
 when we waited for the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.109
 title between this one and frank and will 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.550
 category but is in a very 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.219
 sad is a very sad day for the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.039
 motoring when so wheldon with ten 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.680
 in a race that he does not participate in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 the championship ended up dying 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.250
 And then you see the cars for mine. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.469
 calculations would be 20 or 22 cars one 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.289
 last homage is andretti he went 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
 was champion in 2005 laughed at the team 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.520
 andretti green wants bad and beautiful dodo 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 marco andretti as you saw there you see 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 the staff of the ganassi chip took place 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.930
 also in the ganassi chip team 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 there at this age it is aaa the wife 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.320
 This is where frank is around. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 crying too hard 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 before this homage in the same way the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 tony kannan we see the members of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 penske will power team 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 I was also in the middle of the mess 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.909
 pilots really is his team 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 team if smithey duct team so 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.780
 wheldon ran this race ran 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.750
 indianÃ¡polis ran in this race and finished 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.020
 dying is not the one of the I repeat 33 years of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.900
 age leaves wife and two children one of 2 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 years and one of only seven months 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.200
 Let's stick to the ambient sound of the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 las vegas oval circuit in the latter 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 Homage to dan wheldon plus a pilot 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.980
 who dies in his profession that dies 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.229
 doing what he liked best and there 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.650
 Do you have pictures of dan wheldon? 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.650
 33-year- old English 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.920
 the pilot who ran old door enters 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 because he ran in the indy race league and ran 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.050
 now with unified category ran 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 indy lights occurred in toyota 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.330
 atlantic occurred on the Ganassi 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.200
 andretti green 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.200
 vander casting smith and ends up dying 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.940
 in the last step where he was a 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.690
 special guest 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.519
 ran for one valuable win two 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.200
 millions and a half dollars as he was 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.079
 a special guest as he had a 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.079
 special participation in that event left 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.599
 from the last position in the 34th position 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.739
 even having made a time score a 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.250
 little further on 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.069
 the 34th heldon drop had already 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.680
 gained ten positions at the time of the hit 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.900
 he had won ten positions is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.579
 exactly the dan's car number 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.690
 wheldon was running with the car 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.690
 number 77 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.530
 he who accompanying the last few laps 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.750
 of him was spinning faster than the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
 Tony wants the leader this is normal in this 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.670
 track because he has all that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 turbulence behind and came all or 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.269
 and nothing even though I do not theo 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.830
 I think that's what led to the accident in the 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.170
 if his 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.170
 I think there was no way he could turn aside 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.270
 livina back there very fast and now 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.060
 what happened he unfortunately did not have 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.120
 a lot where to pull everything happens a lot 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.190
 quick a human something only 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.470
 It is worth remembering that this is what 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.880
 evolving is not the indy formula she always 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.070
 is thinking about safety is one of the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.380
 greatest fears of any pilot who 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.150
 run the val is you do not hit the wall and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.100
 if that screen you see from the side 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.560
 left because time you take off 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.060
 hit the wall that makes you slip and you 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.240
 loses that impact 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.040
 only when you hit the screen directly 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.989
 She's there to sticking to ensure 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.730
 the parts is not done by car crash without 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.630
 not to let the pieces go to 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.180
 bleachers 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.370
 only she does not have is she does not take this 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.320
 she leaves the car sticking in the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.310
 screen just as we had the death of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.290
 some pilots 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.510
 I remember my time with Tony Renna 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.720
 by the training ganassi hit directly on the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.090
 screen and there it is and the next car 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.070
 This is the last year of these cars that 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.260
 Are you seeing the car next year? 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.550
 will have protection behind 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.010
 exactly what happened did not happen 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.320
 with several cars now for when you have 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.750
 a slowdown the car hits the tire 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.190
 of the front car lift flight and goes in 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.710
 direction to the screen next year the cars 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.180
 go vim with rear bumper is 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.390
 just so if that happens 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.720
 You push the car in the front and it 's 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.430
 to just not take off and I think 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.830
 You can not pass us 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.690
 You have to take this sad moment to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.990
 try to learn and see what can be 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.419
 done so that does not happen again but 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.400
 a car that walks 360km on average 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.100
 more or less in this circuit 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.860
 If you get caught in a bad way then you 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.110
 security that really takes account of 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.700
 when it is to be real still think that 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.400
 has no way cars are now going to 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.400
 the pits have already paid homage to five 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.000
 returns in homage to the paulistas 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.930
 now the palms on the arrival of the cars 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.409
 the boxes closing the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.050
 season 2011 of formula 1 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.789
 And there you are watching tony kanaan tony 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.369
 kanaan who left on pole position and 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.919
 led until the moment of the accident 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:54.999
 one of the most emotional 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.739
 meeting with the management of the indy formula 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:59.019
 Pedro is with the pilots. 

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:01.899
 there was announced the death of dan wheldon 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.849
 and the pilots along with the direction of the 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.009
 indy formula decided to do this 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.019
 homage to the cars of the five laps 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.899
 that las vegas circuit for 

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:13.439
 homage to study elton and ending 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:16.809
 a very sad season this season 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.059
 2011 is the scotch franchitti dario 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:22.029
 the flying scotchman franchitti goes 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.649
 coming and also very moved ary 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.479
 franchitti at the moment he was 

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.629
 positioned within the cockpit of your 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.629
 car
