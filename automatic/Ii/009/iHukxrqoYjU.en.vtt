00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
a lot more patient interaction than I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
a lot more patient interaction than I
think<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.530> other<00:01:37.770> pharmacy<00:01:38.490> services

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700

can provide

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.780
