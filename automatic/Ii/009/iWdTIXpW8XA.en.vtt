when we come to a place like this in the
winter<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.520> don't<00:00:17.700> have<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.060> bright

winter and we don't have to have bright
sunlight<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.470> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.710> called<00:00:19.890> limp<00:00:20.130> light

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
sunlight you kind of called limp light

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
sunlight you kind of called limp light
for<00:00:21.510> lack<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> better<00:00:22.170> term<00:00:22.320> fog<00:00:23.100> refers

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
for lack of a better term fog refers

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
for lack of a better term fog refers
term<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:25.110> scenes<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.560> already

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
term is that these scenes are already

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.370 
term is that these scenes are already
kind<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> monochromatic<00:00:27.200> already<00:00:28.200> by

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
kind of monochromatic already by

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.350 
kind of monochromatic already by
themselves<00:00:29.010> you've<00:00:29.190> got<00:00:29.400> dark<00:00:29.760> darks<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
themselves you've got dark darks and

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.299 
themselves you've got dark darks and
you've<00:00:30.510> got<00:00:30.720> white<00:00:30.900> whites<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.530> there's<00:00:32.160> not

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you've got white whites and there's not

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.520 
you've got white whites and there's not
a<00:00:32.369> lot<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.790> color<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> between<00:00:33.449> so<00:00:33.960> sometimes

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a lot of color in between so sometimes

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.160 
a lot of color in between so sometimes
they<00:00:34.710> lend<00:00:34.949> themselves<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> being<00:00:35.730> better

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
they lend themselves to being better

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
they lend themselves to being better
black-and-white<00:00:37.170> photographs<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:38.580> color

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
black-and-white photographs then color

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.140 
black-and-white photographs then color
shots<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.500> black<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.129> white<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
shots that look black and white so this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.090 
shots that look black and white so this
particular<00:00:42.449> scene<00:00:42.900> notice<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.010> going

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
particular scene notice this I'm going

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.889 
particular scene notice this I'm going
to<00:00:44.160> take<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> turn<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.059> into<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to take this and turn this into a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.750 
to take this and turn this into a
black-and-white<00:00:46.440> image<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.460> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
black-and-white image and you can see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
black-and-white image and you can see
the<00:00:47.850> difference<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.329> subtle<00:00:48.720> but<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.870> can

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the difference it's subtle but you can

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
the difference it's subtle but you can
see<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.410> difference<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.610> seems<00:00:50.880> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
see the difference it actually seems to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
see the difference it actually seems to
be<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.600> richer<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.350> black<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
be a little bit richer in black and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
be a little bit richer in black and
white<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:53.969> more<00:00:54.149> realistic<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
white and a little bit more realistic in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
white and a little bit more realistic in
black<00:00:55.980> light<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.790> medium

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
black light it's just the way the medium

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.209 
black light it's just the way the medium
works<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.559> times<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
works and so there are times when you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.280 
works and so there are times when you
get<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.489> limp<00:00:59.790> light<00:01:00.030> we're<00:01:00.690> converting<00:01:01.110> a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
get this limp light we're converting a

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.560 
get this limp light we're converting a
shot<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> colored<00:01:02.940> into<00:01:03.329> black<00:01:03.540> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
shot that is colored into black and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
shot that is colored into black and
white<00:01:03.830> really<00:01:04.830> allows<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> image<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> speak

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
white really allows the image to speak

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.960 
white really allows the image to speak
at<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.780> greater<00:01:07.140> volume<00:01:07.410> so<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:08.550> decisions

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
at a greater volume so the decisions

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.900 
at a greater volume so the decisions
that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:10.340> converting<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> shot<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
that you make when converting a shot in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.910 
that you make when converting a shot in
this<00:01:12.149> limp<00:01:12.360> light<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.869> black<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.680> white<00:01:13.800> from

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this limp light to black and white from

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.370 
this limp light to black and white from
color<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.180> pretty<00:01:15.420> easy<00:01:15.690> decision<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
color it's a pretty easy decision to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
color it's a pretty easy decision to
make<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> Sun<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
make because if the Sun was out and it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
make because if the Sun was out and it
was<00:01:18.270> crisp<00:01:18.750> my<00:01:19.500> gosh<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> gold<00:01:20.729> low

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
was crisp my gosh you get that gold low

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.639 
was crisp my gosh you get that gold low
light<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.450> afternoon<00:01:22.110> light<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.560> hitting

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
light or afternoon light that's hitting

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.340 
light or afternoon light that's hitting
your<00:01:22.950> scene<00:01:23.569> you<00:01:24.569> don't<00:01:24.750> even<00:01:24.929> think<00:01:25.170> black

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
your scene you don't even think black

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.680 
your scene you don't even think black
and<00:01:25.380> white<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.030> particular<00:01:27.240> case

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
and white and so in this particular case

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.210 
and white and so in this particular case
I'm<00:01:27.899> thinking<00:01:27.959> black<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> white<00:01:29.039> because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
I'm thinking black and white because

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730 
I'm thinking black and white because
it's<00:01:29.490> already<00:01:29.729> almost<00:01:30.539> black<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.200> white<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it's already almost black and white and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.699 
it's already almost black and white and
so<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> decisions<00:01:32.789> become<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.929> easy<00:01:34.050> choice

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
so the decisions become very easy choice

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.109 
so the decisions become very easy choice
when<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.069> out<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.550> if<00:01:35.849> I'm<00:01:35.970> in

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
when you're out there because if I'm in

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
when you're out there because if I'm in
the<00:01:36.300> winter<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.319> I've<00:01:37.440> got<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> gold<00:01:38.160> light

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the winter and I've got that gold light

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.669 
the winter and I've got that gold light
that's<00:01:38.729> lining<00:01:39.209> my<00:01:39.300> Sun<00:01:39.539> up<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.780> warmth<00:01:40.440> that

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
that's lining my Sun up that warmth that

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.100 
that's lining my Sun up that warmth that
gets<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.789> takes<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.209> cold<00:01:42.479> scene<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
gets there it takes a cold scene and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.589 
gets there it takes a cold scene and
makes<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> warm<00:01:44.099> why<00:01:44.819> would<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> buy<00:01:45.300> pice

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
makes it warm why would I buy pice

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.529 
makes it warm why would I buy pice
bypass<00:01:46.349> that<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.830> turn<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:47.819> a<00:01:48.030> black<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
bypass that and turn it into a black and

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.359 
bypass that and turn it into a black and
white<00:01:48.660> shot<00:01:48.929> so<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.619> decisions<00:01:50.099> are<00:01:50.220> pretty

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
white shot so the decisions are pretty

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.589 
white shot so the decisions are pretty
easy<00:01:50.550> but<00:01:50.789> it's<00:01:50.940> nice<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.209> always<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.509> your

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:51.599 
easy but it's nice to always have your

00:01:51.599 --> 00:02:03.040 
easy but it's nice to always have your
mind<00:01:51.810> open<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.319> one<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.590> other

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.110 

you
