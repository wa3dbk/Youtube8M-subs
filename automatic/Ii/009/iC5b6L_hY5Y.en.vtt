about<00:01:06.860> 120,000<00:01:07.860> miles<00:01:08.039> so<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> lot

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
about 120,000 miles so you have a lot

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.340 
about 120,000 miles so you have a lot
less<00:01:09.090> maintenance<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.660> have<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.929> do<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> these

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
less maintenance you have to do to these

videos<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:10.950> has<00:01:11.069> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.399> low<00:01:11.670> end<00:01:11.910> torque<00:01:12.390> so

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
videos it has a lot of low end torque so

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.570 
videos it has a lot of low end torque so
you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> mash<00:01:13.740> accelerator<00:01:14.369> all

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you don't have to mash accelerator all

than airbags do alone the only thing
that<00:01:25.709> beats<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:27.410> reason<00:01:28.410> why<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.679> use<00:01:28.800> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that beats that reason why we use the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.040 
that beats that reason why we use the
word<00:01:28.950> statistically<00:01:29.819> is<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.929> it

word statistically is because it
