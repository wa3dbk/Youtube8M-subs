Brady Bush and fit racquets I think this

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.900 
Brady Bush and fit racquets I think this
is<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.379> same<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.710> same<00:00:16.980> team<00:00:17.250> he<00:00:17.400> had<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
is the same one same team he had as the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.490 
is the same one same team he had as the
last<00:00:18.090> time<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.359> played<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.720> anyways<00:00:18.930> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
last time we played but anyways this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.370 
last time we played but anyways this
time<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.770> joined<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.100> late<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.430> joined<00:00:20.699> in

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
time we joined in late we joined in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
time we joined in late we joined in
about<00:00:22.380> three<00:00:22.710> minutes<00:00:22.830> late<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> score

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
about three minutes late and the score

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.300 
about three minutes late and the score
wasn't<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> big<00:00:26.010> deal<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.189> think

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
wasn't really much of a big deal I think

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
wasn't really much of a big deal I think
they<00:00:26.580> only<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:27.000> only<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> ten

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
they only they only had about a ten

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300 
they only they only had about a ten
point<00:00:28.080> lead<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.470> had<00:00:28.590> 70<00:00:28.859> boys<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.220> were

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
point lead and I had 70 boys they were

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.150 
point lead and I had 70 boys they were
really<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.699> farming<00:00:30.090> pretty<00:00:30.300> hard<00:00:30.920> but<00:00:31.920> what

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
really like farming pretty hard but what

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.220 
really like farming pretty hard but what
really<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> issue<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> had

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
really was the issue is they kind of had

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
really was the issue is they kind of had
a<00:00:34.260> lot<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.500> kills<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.760> they

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a lot of kills not like a lot but they

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
a lot of kills not like a lot but they
had<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.260> 15<00:00:37.829> -<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.760> 17<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
had all around 15 - I think 17 was the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
had all around 15 - I think 17 was the
max<00:00:39.600> kills<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> kitty<00:00:40.110> counts<00:00:40.379> had<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
max kills the kitty counts had so you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.420 
max kills the kitty counts had so you
know<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.540> had<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> good<00:00:43.079> build<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.129> kills

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
know they had a good build up on kills

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
know they had a good build up on kills
and<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:44.789> also<00:00:44.910> had<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.239> V<00:00:45.420> sets<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.840> already

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and they also had like V sets up already

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.100 
and they also had like V sets up already
and<00:00:46.289> stuff<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:48.000> he<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.239> 17<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and stuff so I think he was like 17 and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
and stuff so I think he was like 17 and
one<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.469> joined<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:50.160> obviously<00:00:50.309> had

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
one when we joined so he obviously had

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.299 
one when we joined so he obviously had
to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.730> set<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> made<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to be set up and so that made it kind of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
to be set up and so that made it kind of
annoying<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.730> already<00:00:53.850> had<00:00:54.000> V<00:00:54.120> sets

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
annoying they already had V sets

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.549 
annoying they already had V sets
counters<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> stuff<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.469> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
counters all that stuff up when we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
counters all that stuff up when we
joined<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.489> after<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> couple<00:00:56.789> minutes

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
joined I think after a couple minutes

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
joined I think after a couple minutes
you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.260> shit<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.500> went<00:00:58.649> away<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you know that shit all went away and it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.099 
you know that shit all went away and it
was<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.730> even<00:01:00.000> playing<00:01:00.180> field<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.719> basically

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was an even playing field and basically

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
was an even playing field and basically
we<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.710> strike<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.070> pretty<00:01:02.250> bad

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
we actually you strike them pretty bad

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.619 
we actually you strike them pretty bad
to<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.579> honest<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.940> beat<00:01:03.059> him<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> hundred

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to be honest we beat him by a hundred

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.289 
to be honest we beat him by a hundred
points<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.820> 99

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
points I think well I think like 99

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.609 
points I think well I think like 99
points<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> almost<00:01:07.080> hundred<00:01:07.260> points

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
points from the almost hundred points

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
points from the almost hundred points
and<00:01:07.909> considering<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> joined<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.450> late

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and considering that we joined in late

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
and considering that we joined in late
that's<00:01:10.380> pretty<00:01:11.159> bad<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.820> honest<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> mean

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that's pretty bad to be honest I mean

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.760 
that's pretty bad to be honest I mean
even<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.720> hadn't<00:01:13.020> joined<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.260> late<00:01:13.409> getting

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
even if we hadn't joined in late getting

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
even if we hadn't joined in late getting
be<00:01:13.860> 100<00:01:14.250> points<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.520> pretty<00:01:14.729> bad<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.830> now

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
be 100 points is pretty bad and now

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
be 100 points is pretty bad and now
obviously<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.280> did<00:01:17.430> al<00:01:17.580> slay<00:01:17.909> us<00:01:18.710> because

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
obviously they did al slay us because

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.370 
obviously they did al slay us because
they<00:01:20.070> had<00:01:20.540> some<00:01:21.540> kills<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.020> joined<00:01:22.229> when

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
they had some kills when we joined when

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
they had some kills when we joined when
we<00:01:22.470> were<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.460> we

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
we were all we know and then you know we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.160 
we were all we know and then you know we
also<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> struggle<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.990> well

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
also had a bit of a struggle as well

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
also had a bit of a struggle as well
when<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.350> joined<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.130> V<00:01:26.280> sets

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
when we joined because they had V sets

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.039 
when we joined because they had V sets
up<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> stuff<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
up and stuff so it was a bit of a
