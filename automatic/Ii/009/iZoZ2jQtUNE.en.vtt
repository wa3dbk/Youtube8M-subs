two and a half inches or less you can
use<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.870> system<00:01:08.260> as<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.920> get<00:01:09.100> higher<00:01:09.970> if<00:01:10.360> you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
use this system as you get higher if you

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.690 
use this system as you get higher if you
want<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.750> get<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> thicker<00:01:11.380> countertop<00:01:12.010> you

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
want to get a thicker countertop you

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.830 
want to get a thicker countertop you
don't<00:01:12.880> want<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.060> use<00:01:13.180> this<00:01:13.330> system<00:01:13.540> because

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
don't want to use this system because

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.480 
don't want to use this system because
it's<00:01:14.140> going<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.380> stress<00:01:14.770> you<00:01:15.250> know<00:01:15.340> you're

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
it's going to stress you know you're

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's going to stress you know you're
gonna<00:01:15.580> have<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.820> have<00:01:16.000> more<00:01:16.180> reinforcing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
gonna have to have more reinforcing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.270 
gonna have to have more reinforcing
essentially<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:17.710> if<00:01:17.800> I<00:01:17.890> understand<00:01:18.250> correctly

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
essentially so if I understand correctly

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.250 
essentially so if I understand correctly
this<00:01:18.820> is<00:01:19.000> sold<00:01:19.210> as<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.390> system<00:01:19.840> short<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.200> the

a system that is sold to the contractor

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.780 
a system that is sold to the contractor
exactly<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.230> exactly<00:01:26.680> right<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.280> what's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
exactly it's exactly right and so what's

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.910 
exactly it's exactly right and so what's
the<00:01:27.940> product<00:01:28.360> here<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.230> how<00:01:29.380> does<00:01:29.440> this<00:01:29.680> work

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
the product here and how does this work

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380 
the product here and how does this work
in<00:01:30.130> terms<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:30.670> you're<00:01:30.820> mixing<00:01:31.090> together

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
in terms of what you're mixing together

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.090 
in terms of what you're mixing together
to<00:01:31.540> actually<00:01:31.690> produce<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.740> concrete

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
to actually produce the concrete

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.410 
to actually produce the concrete
material<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:35.440> had<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> big<00:01:36.490> decision<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.940> make

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
material we had a big decision to make

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.480 
material we had a big decision to make
was<00:01:37.840> whether<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.350> mountain<00:01:38.680> not<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.310> make

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
was whether it in a mountain not to make

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.740 
was whether it in a mountain not to make
a<00:01:39.520> single<00:01:40.360> sack<00:01:40.750> mix<00:01:41.230> or<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.360> was<00:01:43.480> a<00:01:43.510> big

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
a single sack mix or it was a big

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.720 
a single sack mix or it was a big
decision<00:01:43.900> on<00:01:44.260> my<00:01:44.409> part<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> smaller

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
decision on my part to have a smaller

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.720 
decision on my part to have a smaller
footprint<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.420> greener<00:01:47.020> product<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.580> we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
footprint a greener product and so we

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.390 
footprint a greener product and so we
decided<00:01:49.060> that<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:50.020> would<00:01:50.170> work<00:01:50.409> with<00:01:50.650> existing

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
decided that we would work with existing

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.070 
decided that we would work with existing
concrete<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.210> uses<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.510> readily<00:01:52.990> available

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080

you<00:01:55.090> want<00:01:55.330> hardware<00:01:56.260> stores<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.979> we<00:01:57.190> partnered

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
you want hardware stores so we partnered

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.490 
you want hardware stores so we partnered
up<00:01:58.270> with<00:01:58.300> sack<00:01:58.570> Crete<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:58.960> we<00:01:59.110> said<00:01:59.290> let's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
up with sack Crete and we said let's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.350 
up with sack Crete and we said let's
formulate<00:02:00.040> something<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.970> ubiquitous

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
formulate something that is ubiquitous

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.190 
formulate something that is ubiquitous
okay<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.680> made<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.310> sack<00:02:04.150> cream<00:02:04.360> Ickx<00:02:04.720> we

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
okay and so we made a sack cream Ickx we

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay and so we made a sack cream Ickx we
worked<00:02:05.440> with<00:02:05.590> their<00:02:05.710> formula<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.550> it's<00:02:07.450> a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
worked with their formula and it's a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.229 
worked with their formula and it's a
formula<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.649> can<00:02:08.769> use<00:02:08.859> for<00:02:09.039> anything<00:02:09.219> you<00:02:09.999> add

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
formula you can use for anything you add

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.430 
formula you can use for anything you add
our<00:02:10.479> pro<00:02:10.719> formula<00:02:11.230> mix<00:02:11.439> to<00:02:11.590> this

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
our pro formula mix to this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.480 
our pro formula mix to this
and<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:13.460> becomes<00:02:13.940> countertop<00:02:14.540> great<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.710> a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
and it becomes countertop great so a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.070 
and it becomes countertop great so a
contractor<00:02:17.300> doesn't<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.750> stock
