identify the shape of all the buildings

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
identify the shape of all the buildings
and<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> information<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.960> can't<00:01:22.409> be

and get the information that can't be

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
and get the information that can't be
scanned<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.340> street<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.970> view

scanned from a street point of view

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.380 
scanned from a street point of view
let's<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.409> even<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.250> higher<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
let's go even a little higher to get the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
let's go even a little higher to get the
overall<00:01:27.840> picture

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.819 

so<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.450> how<00:01:34.600> information<00:01:34.929> is<00:01:35.469> collected

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
so this is how information is collected

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.270 
so this is how information is collected
but<00:01:36.820> how<00:01:37.179> is<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.170> data<00:01:38.469> ends<00:01:39.159> up

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
but how is it that this data ends up

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.889 
but how is it that this data ends up
being<00:01:39.460> such<00:01:39.820> an<00:01:40.030> amazing<00:01:40.659> piece<00:01:40.869> of
