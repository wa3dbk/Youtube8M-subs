00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the moment to the cosmos hope step I i'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
the moment to the cosmos hope step I i'm
using<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> tripod<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.790> why<00:01:18.000> i

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
using a tripod right now so that's why i

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.440 
using a tripod right now so that's why i
am<00:01:18.240> flying<00:01:19.080> around<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> haven't<00:01:20.009> done<00:01:20.130> any

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
am flying around with a haven't done any

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.810 
am flying around with a haven't done any
recording<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.080> let's<00:01:22.460> I'm<00:01:23.460> anup

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
recording in the one so let's I'm anup

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.440 
recording in the one so let's I'm anup
right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.900> basically<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
right now so basically you can see the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
right now so basically you can see the
LED<00:01:27.810> cable<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> be

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
LED cable going down it's going to be

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.100 
LED cable going down it's going to be
hidden<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> cannot<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.270> aunt

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
hidden and so you cannot see and aunt

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.240 
hidden and so you cannot see and aunt
you<00:01:34.200> already<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> test<00:01:36.710> before<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.950> cut<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you already just a test before I cut the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.749 
you already just a test before I cut the
cable<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.420> modify<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
cable so i can modify it and use that

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.859 
cable so i can modify it and use that
original<00:01:41.759> box<00:01:42.060> flow<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> hopefully<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:45.659> not

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
original box flow so hopefully it's not

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.490 
original box flow so hopefully it's not
gonna<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:47.149> better<00:01:48.149> when<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:48.810> finished<00:01:49.259> here

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
gonna look better when I'm finished here

switching<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:08.920> i<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.130> find<00:03:09.280> there<00:03:09.519> we<00:03:09.580> go

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
switching so if i can find there we go

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.110 
switching so if i can find there we go
and<00:03:10.959> i<00:03:11.560> can<00:03:11.799> also<00:03:11.859> turn<00:03:12.280> down<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.730> speed<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and i can also turn down the speed of

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.210 
and i can also turn down the speed of
that<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:14.320> really<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.920> slope

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that so it's going really the slope

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.000 
that so it's going really the slope
between<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.670> colors<00:03:16.000> i<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:17.260> also<00:03:17.410> set<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.859> to

between the colors i can also set it to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.250 
between the colors i can also set it to
