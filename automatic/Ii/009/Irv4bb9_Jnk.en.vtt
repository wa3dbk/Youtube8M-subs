that I mean so embarrassing but I think

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.780 
that I mean so embarrassing but I think
he's<00:03:07.319> got<00:03:07.470> maybe<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.709> couple<00:03:07.980> more<00:03:08.220> matches<00:03:08.639> in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
he's got maybe a couple more matches in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.550 
he's got maybe a couple more matches in
him<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.780> really<00:03:09.810> believe<00:03:10.530> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
him and I really believe that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.470 
him and I really believe that
WrestleMania<00:03:11.220> coming<00:03:11.730> round<00:03:11.879> hill<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.359> his

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
WrestleMania coming round hill of his

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.839 
WrestleMania coming round hill of his
last<00:03:12.720> match<00:03:13.069> who<00:03:14.069> could<00:03:14.280> he<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.549> may<00:03:14.790> be

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
last match who could he have it may be

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.339 
last match who could he have it may be
sting<00:03:15.269> maybe<00:03:15.599> have<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> retirement<00:03:16.079> match

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
against sting who knows but I think

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.819 
against sting who knows but I think
that's<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.810> hurt<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.319> nail<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.799> coffin

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
feel that Roman reigns is just an

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.580 
feel that Roman reigns is just an
awesome<00:04:17.729> guy<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.630> tag<00:04:18.870> team<00:04:18.900> like<00:04:19.289> we<00:04:19.440> know

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
awesome guy in a tag team like we know

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.800 
awesome guy in a tag team like we know
he's<00:04:19.919> not<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.190> best<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.700> dice<00:04:20.969> charisma<00:04:21.630> and

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
he's not the best with dice charisma and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.540 
he's not the best with dice charisma and
that<00:04:21.959> he's<00:04:22.289> not<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.500> great<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> mic<00:04:23.159> but

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
that he's not that great on the mic but

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.790 
that he's not that great on the mic but
wrestling<00:04:24.270> wise<00:04:24.419> is<00:04:24.719> good<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.469> think<00:04:25.680> he's

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
wrestling wise is good and I think he's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.500
