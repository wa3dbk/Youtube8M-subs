00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 gabriel 20 hours so you 're a student 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.100
 second year of medicine 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.980
 Congratulations you have passed the competition is not 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.090
 which has very complicated course so 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 reminder to start your journey 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.009
 since the ferry so I did so a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.570
 bac s I got a mention well 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 Then I went straight back 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.470
 first year of medicine I do them 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.920
 so twice I passed doubling in 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 second year of medicine at the same time 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.160
 so I did the prepas a prepares 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 so they are called epsilon who has him 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 allowed to review the courses at the same time 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.730
 always have drills 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 teacher training that was 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 always there for me so it helped me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 how is it going so it was a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.930
 prepa at the same time in parallel it was 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.180
 for calais medicine is called its preparation 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 but it's more courses for classes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590
 in parallel who resume the courses of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.890
 the college is not it's basically it's a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 help without injury by a prep when we 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 hear prepa it is said right away 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 louis grand henri iv but it's more of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 parallel course that helps 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.020
 students to take back what the teacher has 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.670
 says in court because it's not 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.180
 necessarily acquired from the first since the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.790
 first listen 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.830
 so you managed early to pass 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.750
 how did you do tips 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.590
 that you could give to succeed 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.230
 contest that is still 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.840
 reputed to be difficult then a 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.250
 girl not necessarily very very say 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.440
 jovial is still a lot of 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.560
 job I was doing about 9 hours 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 to 23 hours of work finally 9 hours 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.740
 from morning to 11 pm I was working at 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.080
 pretty much right after there are bound to be the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.150
 breaks and all that there were the outings 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.500
 Saturday night so we can still 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.820
 go out in first year but if it's 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.690
 that's pretty important to know because 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.890
 that there are people who say we are going 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.110
 shut up we could see our friends 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.580
 it's wrong we can go out there was 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.750
 also some sleep late but after 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 it's greasy mornings that means 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.740
 10 o'clock in the morning it's not either 13 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.770
 hours so nothing and Sunday from 10am to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.490
 23h also in medicine you have to know 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.930
 something is that there is no 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 weekend there are no holidays there 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800
 nothing from the moment we can 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.060
 to work we do that it's the most 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.580
 important to know and really it's 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.410
 something that is difficult at the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.690
 out of high school to understand but at 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.250
 final we do it here is my job then 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.110
 it works because the contest you 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 would not have had that meaning the prepa say 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.530
 that it's complicated because the preparation 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 it is really a help in addition certainly 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.489
 that's not all because a good preparation 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.750
 it is fine to say it like that and it 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.700
 courses in addition it's great you can 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.060
 can all see again we can all posed as 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.489
 question 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.840
 it's true but then if there is not the 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.070
 work that follows behind you can nothing 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.260
 to do so that yes it is 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.760
 necessarily a bonus explanations of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.350
 training or competition because mine 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 of nothing finally he has necessarily 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.580
 typical exercises and all that yes necessarily 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.690
 it's good but after you have to work 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.519
 all the time all the time all the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.840
 time so me I think that since I 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.070
 am not a big worker in the soul 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.830
 I think having this 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.110
 little help everyday yes it helped me 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.870
 after i'm not sure that all the time 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.120
 it is necessarily useful but for me 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.970
 yes that's been helpful now the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
 good course is spent your daily in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.650
 second year what is it more 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.040
 calm 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.140
 really very very calm 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.879
 yes, we go from a dozen 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.829
 dozen hours of work at 4 5 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.930
 hours and it's not the same job 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.340
 it's really that of Contents 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.379
 touch to medicine the pneumology the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.280
 cardiology endocrinology so there 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
 really it's something more 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 interesting is where we are we are 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.069
 come to medicine to do that while 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
 the first medicine is that it can 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.189
 to be materials a little let's say one 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.510
 little annoying all that is chemical 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.889
 physical and all that so it can be a 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.299
 not very forbidding but once in the second 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.670
 year we work less and things 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.040
 really really very very good at doing 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.480
 as interesting and to finish your 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.379
 ambitions you would like to be a doctor 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.239
 generalist you would like you are 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.280
 specialized let's say I know 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.750
 absolutely not actually because I'm 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.260
 arrived in medicine a bit a bit at 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.230
 hazard 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.829
 say because I did not necessarily 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.609
 a super super folder bac s mention 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.769
 well anyway 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.939
 but it was not I was hungry I got 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.049
 well snatched for having this mention 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.970
 Well, I was not a big boss at 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.930
 high school so I arrived in medicine from 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.739
 I have not really thought yet 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.359
 I was really in my books 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.769
 during the first year and suddenly there 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.480
 I go out a little head of the water 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.970
 so I still do not really know what 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 I want to do but what way do I 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.930
 see we have a lot of internship the 2nd to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.949
 the 6th grade then we like even during 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.099
 internat we can do a lot of stuff 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:11.269
 so the choice will eventually be 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.269
 in six seven eight years
