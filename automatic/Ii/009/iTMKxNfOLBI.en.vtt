00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
think from England's just got the worst

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
think from England's just got the worst
part<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> ruling<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
part of the ruling and it was kind of to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
part of the ruling and it was kind of to
me<00:00:47.730> unfair<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.360> him<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
me unfair for him so I was kind of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920 
me unfair for him so I was kind of
arguing<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> his<00:00:49.530> behalf<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.910> no<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.780> else

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
arguing on his behalf and no one else

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.029 
arguing on his behalf and no one else
would<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.079> been<00:00:52.170> hurt<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> had<00:00:52.860> was

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
would have been hurt if it had was

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
would have been hurt if it had was
called<00:00:53.219> dead<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.730> by<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> rules<00:00:54.539> maybe<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
called dead but by the rules maybe the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
called dead but by the rules maybe the
right<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.670> keep<00:00:57.120> keep<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> hand

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
right thing was to keep keep the hand

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.060 
right thing was to keep keep the hand
played<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.320> we'd<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> post<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> big

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
played so we'd have to post the big

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.910 
played so we'd have to post the big
blind<00:00:59.219> twice<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> sucked<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.739> him

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
blind twice which kind of sucked for him

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.420

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
ruling to me common sense should always

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
ruling to me common sense should always
overrule<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> rules<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:15.090> sometimes<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.780> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
overrule the rules but sometimes we just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.999 
overrule the rules but sometimes we just
stick<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> rules<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> he<00:01:16.619> got<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> brunt

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
stick to the rules and he got the brunt

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
stick to the rules and he got the brunt
of<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.970> worked<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.420> him<00:01:18.540> because

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of it but it worked out for him because

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.330 
of it but it worked out for him because
you<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:19.049> won<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> hand<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:20.100> though<00:01:20.220> he

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you actually won the hand even though he

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
you actually won the hand even though he
shouldn't<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.700> dealt<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> hand<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
shouldn't got dealt that hand well this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.260 
shouldn't got dealt that hand well this
is<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.280> fact<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:23.610> his<00:01:23.880> first

time<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.080> Vegas<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.619> he's<00:01:25.770> really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
time here in Vegas but he's really

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
get that far is kind of crazy yeah but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.929

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but even the best dealers make some

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
but even the best dealers make some
mistakes<00:01:51.720> some<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> times<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> players
