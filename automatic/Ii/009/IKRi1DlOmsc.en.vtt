independent electric motors in the wheel

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
independent electric motors in the wheel
hubs<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> models<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.280> quite<00:01:41.520> large<00:01:41.759> wheel

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hubs so the models got quite large wheel

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210 
hubs so the models got quite large wheel
hubs<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.750> decent<00:01:43.140> rubber<00:01:43.380> tires<00:01:43.619> mounted<00:01:44.100> on

hubs with decent rubber tires mounted on

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
hubs with decent rubber tires mounted on
them<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> let's<00:01:46.079> start<00:01:46.409> by<00:01:46.560> having<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.890> look

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
them so let's start by having a look

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.770 
them so let's start by having a look
underneath<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.549> model<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.390> detail

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
underneath the model and the detail

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.039 
underneath the model and the detail
level<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.759> simple<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.689> course<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
level is simple but then of course the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.560 
level is simple but then of course the
real<00:01:52.170> machine<00:01:52.439> might<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
real machine might be like that and it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.420 
real machine might be like that and it
pushes<00:01:54.750> along<00:01:55.049> quite<00:01:55.290> well<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.280> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
pushes along quite well and you can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.959 
pushes along quite well and you can
articulate<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.119> body<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> small<00:01:59.399> amount<00:01:59.700> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
articulate the body to a small amount so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.039 
articulate the body to a small amount so
it<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.659> steer<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:02.299> great<00:02:03.299> feature<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it can steer and great feature is the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.929 
it can steer and great feature is the
independent<00:02:04.829> suspension<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.759> see

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
independent suspension and you can see

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.449 
independent suspension and you can see
that<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.360> body<00:02:06.780> pushes<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.469> down<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that the body pushes up and down and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.910 
that the body pushes up and down and
each<00:02:08.610> wheel<00:02:08.849> has<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.629> lot<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> movement<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
each wheel has a lot of movement and you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
each wheel has a lot of movement and you
can<00:02:11.069> Twitter<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.700> up

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
can Twitter them up

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.500 
can Twitter them up
as<00:02:12.390> much<00:02:12.630> as<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.640> wheel<00:02:14.910> arches<00:02:15.330> on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
as much as you like the wheel arches on

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.990 
as much as you like the wheel arches on
the<00:02:15.780> model<00:02:16.020> are<00:02:16.230> plastic<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.700> rest<00:02:17.880> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the model are plastic but the rest of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.750 
the model are plastic but the rest of
the<00:02:18.090> body<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.660> metal<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.770> got<00:02:19.950> quite<00:02:20.670> an

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the body is metal and it's got quite an

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.780 
the body is metal and it's got quite an
interesting<00:02:21.030> metallic<00:02:21.720> looking<00:02:22.230> paint

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
interesting metallic looking paint

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.070 
interesting metallic looking paint
another<00:02:23.790> interesting<00:02:24.390> feature<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
another interesting feature of the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.230 
another interesting feature of the
concept<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.770> an<00:02:26.190> extendable<00:02:26.640> counterweight

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
concept is an extendable counterweight

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.380 
concept is an extendable counterweight
that<00:02:28.020> just<00:02:28.470> pushes<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.490> out<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.090> that's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that just pushes in and out and that's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.540 
that just pushes in and out and that's
claimed<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.020> increase<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.950> stability<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.430> the

modelled simply the first degree of
movement<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.850> pivot<00:03:00.150> point<00:03:00.420> and

there's no cylinder driving it which
seemed<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.460> little<00:03:02.550> bit<00:03:02.760> odd<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> second

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
seemed a little bit odd but the second

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.590 
seemed a little bit odd but the second
cylinder<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.550> actually<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.030> too<00:03:06.180> short<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
cylinder is actually a bit too short and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.320 
cylinder is actually a bit too short and
as<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.620> pops<00:03:08.070> out<00:03:08.330> having

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
as you can see there it pops out having

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.850 
as you can see there it pops out having
carried<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> futuristically<00:03:10.500> quick

repair<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> model<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.940> carry<00:03:12.180> on

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
repair to the model we can carry on

trying<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.930> use<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> loader<00:03:13.350> mechanism<00:03:13.760> you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
trying to use the loader mechanism you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760 
trying to use the loader mechanism you
can<00:03:14.880> see<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.090> tips<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.570> quite<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> good<00:03:16.590> angle

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
can see it tips to quite a good angle

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.790 
can see it tips to quite a good angle
there's<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:17.850> looseness<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.800> loader

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
there's some looseness in the loader

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.650 
there's some looseness in the loader
mechanism<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.640> doesn't<00:03:21.000> hold<00:03:21.239> every<00:03:21.450> pose

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
mechanism so it doesn't hold every pose

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.170 
mechanism so it doesn't hold every pose
that<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.050> might<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.670> but<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.790> it's

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
that you might like but it's it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.810 
that you might like but it's it's
reasonable<00:03:24.660> enough<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.620> be<00:03:26.489> displayed

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
reasonable enough and can be displayed

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.910 
reasonable enough and can be displayed
most<00:03:27.060> ways<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.450> you'd<00:03:27.570> want<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.770> can

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
most ways that you'd want and it can

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.370 
most ways that you'd want and it can
lift<00:03:29.150> quite<00:03:30.150> high<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.720> you're<00:03:30.870> careful<00:03:31.140> not<00:03:31.230> to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
lift quite high if you're careful not to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
lift quite high if you're careful not to
pop<00:03:31.500> out<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.860> cylinder<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:33.030> did<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.480> first

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
pop out the cylinder as I did the first

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.500 
pop out the cylinder as I did the first
time<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.610> an<00:03:35.700> interesting<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.420> unusual

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
time this is an interesting and unusual

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.050 
time this is an interesting and unusual
idea<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.530> diecast<00:03:37.980> scale<00:03:38.310> modelling<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.880> on

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
idea in diecast scale modelling and on

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.610 
idea in diecast scale modelling and on
the<00:03:39.180> whole<00:03:39.300> motor<00:03:39.600> art<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.170> done<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> good<00:03:40.560> job

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the whole motor art have done a good job

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.120 
the whole motor art have done a good job
with<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
with it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.250 
with it
the<00:03:41.880> main<00:03:42.030> downside<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:43.110> is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the main downside is that it is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.140 
the main downside is that it is
expensive<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.370> that's<00:03:44.610> probably<00:03:44.970> as<00:03:45.090> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
expensive and that's probably as a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.940 
expensive and that's probably as a
result<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.900> being<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.230> special<00:03:46.590> limited

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
result of it being a special limited

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.920 
result of it being a special limited
edition<00:03:47.070> model<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:47.910> presumably<00:03:48.390> made<00:03:48.780> in

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
edition model so presumably made in

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.290 
edition model so presumably made in
small<00:03:49.050> numbers<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:50.340> overall<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.820> enough<00:03:51.090> to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
small numbers but overall is enough to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
small numbers but overall is enough to
be<00:03:51.660> able<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.930> recommend<00:03:52.200> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320
