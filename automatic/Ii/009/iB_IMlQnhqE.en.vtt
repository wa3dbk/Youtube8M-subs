00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the servo Bay is located so I'm going to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
the servo Bay is located so I'm going to
have<00:01:21.570> Chris<00:01:21.840> assist<00:01:22.229> me<00:01:22.439> by<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.430> around<00:01:23.520> to

have Chris assist me by going around to
the<00:01:23.820> front<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> plane<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.380> you'll<00:01:25.590> see

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the front of the plane and you'll see

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
the front of the plane and you'll see
that<00:01:25.890> we've<00:01:26.040> removed<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> prop<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that we've removed the prop and the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
that we've removed the prop and the
spinner<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> backplate<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.890> expose<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
spinner and backplate to expose the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.260 
spinner and backplate to expose the
motor<00:01:30.150> shaft<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.350> he<00:01:31.590> gently<00:01:32.040> pulls<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
motor shaft so if he gently pulls up on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.069 
motor shaft so if he gently pulls up on
the<00:01:33.780> motor<00:01:33.990> shaft<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.799> plane<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> free<00:01:36.079> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the motor shaft the plane is free to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
the motor shaft the plane is free to
check<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.560> balance<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> we'll<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
check that balance and we'll do that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.460 
check that balance and we'll do that
let's<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.750> how<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> plane<00:01:40.259> looks<00:01:41.180> okay

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
let's see how this plane looks okay

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.190 
let's see how this plane looks okay
lifting<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:44.240> slightly<00:01:45.240> heavy<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> left

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lifting up slightly heavy on the left

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.190 
lifting up slightly heavy on the left
side<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.909> we'll<00:01:47.909> set<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> hand

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
side so we'll set it down going to hand

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
side so we'll set it down going to hand
over<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.100> couple<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.700> small<00:01:51.270> piece<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> web

over a couple of small piece of the web

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
over a couple of small piece of the web
to<00:01:52.740> Chris<00:01:53.009> he's<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.670> around<00:01:53.729> top
