whatever deals once they get the points
but<00:01:42.869> remember<00:01:43.259> once<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> sniper

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but remember once you use like a sniper

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
but remember once you use like a sniper
rifle<00:01:45.270> card<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.470> can't<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> again

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
rifle card you can't use that again

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
rifle card you can't use that again
until<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> earn<00:01:47.850> another<00:01:48.270> sniper<00:01:48.659> rifle<00:01:49.140> card

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and so that may take a little while for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
and so that may take a little while for
you<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> earn<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.909> like

um you know and also the downside of
having<00:02:10.320> dedicated<00:02:10.830> servers<00:02:11.490> being<00:02:11.670> used<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
having dedicated servers being used in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.020

every<00:02:12.540> experience<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.200> halo<00:02:13.440> 5<00:02:13.650> Guardians<00:02:14.130> so

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
every experience in halo 5 Guardians so

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
every experience in halo 5 Guardians so
you<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.590> wanted<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.130> dedicated<00:02:17.610> servers

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you know you wanted a dedicated servers

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
you know you wanted a dedicated servers
but<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.570> limits<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.320> land<00:02:19.620> stuff<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
but that limits the land stuff and of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.070 
but that limits the land stuff and of
course<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> xbox<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> itself<00:02:21.570> limits<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
course the xbox one itself limits the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.600 
course the xbox one itself limits the
land<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.710> there<00:02:22.860> won't<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.190> any<00:02:23.310> land

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
land think so there won't be any land

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.390 
land think so there won't be any land
support<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.150> any<00:02:24.330> tournaments<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
support in any tournaments you know the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
support in any tournaments you know the
people<00:02:27.060> who<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.240> running<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.570> turn<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:27.960> I'm

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
people who are running the turn so I'm

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290 
people who are running the turn so I'm
going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.380> set<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.740> something<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:30.150> be

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
going to have to set up something to be

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.400 
going to have to set up something to be
able<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.080> know<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.380> off

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.620 
able to like you know right off
dedicated<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.880> off<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.360> game's

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dedicated but like off of the game's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.330 
dedicated but like off of the game's
dedicated<00:02:34.440> servers<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.980> stuff<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.280> that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
dedicated servers and stuff like that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.430 
dedicated servers and stuff like that
typical<00:02:35.940> online<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.360> likely<00:02:36.690> everything<00:02:37.290> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
typical online but likely everything is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.530 
typical online but likely everything is
on<00:02:37.620> dedicated<00:02:38.130> service<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.910> should<00:02:39.300> run<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
on dedicated service so it should run a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.440 
on dedicated service so it should run a
lot<00:02:39.720> smoother<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.380> stuff<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.740> not<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.040> any

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
lot smoother and stuff and not have any

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.180 
lot smoother and stuff and not have any
like<00:02:42.450> host<00:02:42.930> whatever<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> want<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> call<00:02:44.130> it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
like host whatever you want to call it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.890 
like host whatever you want to call it
like<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.490> host<00:02:44.670> privileges<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.510> things<00:02:45.840> like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
like the host privileges or things like

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.980 
like the host privileges or things like
that<00:02:46.520> but<00:02:47.520> now<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.880> matchmaking<00:02:48.660> there's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
that but now on to matchmaking there's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990 
that but now on to matchmaking there's
just<00:02:49.650> one<00:02:49.890> thing<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.400> wanted<00:02:50.940> to
