with<00:00:59.160> visibility<00:00:59.699> another<00:01:00.629> thing<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
with visibility another thing is it's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
with visibility another thing is it's
closer<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> working<00:01:02.370> area<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.090> loader

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
closer to the working area of the loader

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.289 
closer to the working area of the loader
that<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> huge<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.650> stability<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.880> we

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that is huge for stability here we

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
that is huge for stability here we
talked<00:01:06.600> about<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.520> loader<00:01:08.520> stands<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.720> they

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
talked about the loader stands here they

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
talked about the loader stands here they
are<00:01:10.590> wider<00:01:11.100> wider<00:01:11.549> footprint<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.330> for

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
are wider wider footprint here for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
are wider wider footprint here for
stability<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:13.470> also<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.549> integrated

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
stability they also just are integrated

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
stability they also just are integrated
in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> frame<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> looks<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.470> part

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in the frame here looks like it's part

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.550 
in the frame here looks like it's part
of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> loader<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.900> beyond<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> loader<00:01:19.259> Tim

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of the loader so beyond the loader Tim

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
of the loader so beyond the loader Tim
tell<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.189> bit<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.790> 1726<00:01:21.270> why

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
tell me a little bit about this 1726 why

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
tell me a little bit about this 1726 why
should<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.560> excited<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.280> I'm

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
should we be so excited about this I'm

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
should we be so excited about this I'm
pretty<00:01:23.790> excited<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.659> tractor<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
pretty excited about this tractor for a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
pretty excited about this tractor for a
lot<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> reasons<00:01:26.280> probably<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> biggest

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
lot of reasons probably the biggest

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.200 
lot of reasons probably the biggest
reason<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.009> smaller<00:01:29.400> horsepower<00:01:30.030> it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
reason is it's a smaller horsepower it's

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.590 
reason is it's a smaller horsepower it's
under<00:01:30.420> 25<00:01:30.990> horsepower<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.939> 24.8<00:01:32.939> horsepower

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
under 25 horsepower at 24.8 horsepower

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.260 
under 25 horsepower at 24.8 horsepower
it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.350> free<00:01:34.710> cylinder<00:01:35.189> shibaura<00:01:35.700> diesel

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's a free cylinder shibaura diesel

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's a free cylinder shibaura diesel
engine<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.110> basically<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.310> not

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
engine in it and basically it's not

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
engine in it and basically it's not
subject<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> tr4<00:01:39.829> requirements<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
subject to the tr4 requirements that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.819 
subject to the tr4 requirements that
requires<00:01:41.450> particulate<00:01:42.450> filters<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.170> diesel

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
requires particulate filters or diesel

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.030 
requires particulate filters or diesel
emission<00:01:44.340> spray<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.659> being<00:01:46.380> under<00:01:46.619> 25

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
emission spray this being under 25

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670 
emission spray this being under 25
horsepower<00:01:47.549> isn't<00:01:47.880> required<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.290> don't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
horsepower isn't required so we don't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.920 
horsepower isn't required so we don't
have<00:01:49.860> any<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> new<00:01:50.850> emissions<00:01:51.329> technology

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
have any of the new emissions technology

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
have any of the new emissions technology
on<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> tractor<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:53.040> helps<00:01:53.369> keep<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
on this tractor which helps keep the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.359 
on this tractor which helps keep the
price<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.829> thing<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.219> most

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
price down on it the thing I'm most

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
price down on it the thing I'm most
excited<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.659> tractors

excited about is this tractors

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520 
excited about is this tractors
physically<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> same<00:01:59.430> size<00:01:59.729> as<00:02:00.060> our<00:02:00.530> 1739

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
physically the same size as our 1739

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
physically the same size as our 1739
which<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.950> 40<00:02:02.340> horsepower<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.299> 40

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
which is 40 horsepower just about 40

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.249 
which is 40 horsepower just about 40
horsepower<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.810> 25

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
horsepower but it's this is in that 25

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
hard time getting that in the garage if

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.730 
hard time getting that in the garage if
I<00:02:48.570> park<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:48.990> there<00:02:49.110> well<00:02:49.350> we've<00:02:49.500> talked

I park it in there well we've talked

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.380 
I park it in there well we've talked
about<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.100> other<00:02:50.220> videos<00:02:50.370> unlike<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> lot<00:02:51.360> of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
about in other videos unlike a lot of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690 
about in other videos unlike a lot of
our<00:02:51.570> competition<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.800> folding<00:02:53.460> roll

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
our competition this is a folding roll

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700 
our competition this is a folding roll
bar<00:02:53.970> meaning<00:02:54.270> pull<00:02:54.600> two<00:02:54.810> pins<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
bar meaning pull two pins one on the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.980 
bar meaning pull two pins one on the
each<00:02:55.770> side<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.790> roll<00:02:56.970> bar<00:02:57.180> folds<00:02:57.540> back<00:02:57.750> so

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
each side and the roll bar folds back so

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.810 
each side and the roll bar folds back so
you<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.260> get<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.710> any<00:02:59.010> standard<00:02:59.400> garage

about metal fenders metal hood easy pop
hood<00:03:19.190> like<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.280> say<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.640> same<00:03:20.910> features<00:03:21.480> as

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
hood like you say the same features as

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.600 
hood like you say the same features as
our<00:03:21.840> bigger<00:03:22.050> tractors<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.190> smaller

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
our bigger tractors but in a smaller

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.460 
our bigger tractors but in a smaller
horsepower<00:03:24.150> category<00:03:24.780> tell<00:03:25.260> me<00:03:25.350> about

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
horsepower category tell me about

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.260 
horsepower category tell me about
serviceability<00:03:26.160> with<00:03:26.460> this<00:03:26.670> one-piece<00:03:27.240> hood

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
serviceability with this one-piece hood

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.180 
serviceability with this one-piece hood
and<00:03:27.810> obviously<00:03:28.260> seems<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.740> it'd<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> lot

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
and obviously seems like it'd be a lot

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.770 
and obviously seems like it'd be a lot
easier<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.700> service<00:03:29.940> everything<00:03:30.330> well<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
easier to service everything well you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.240 
easier to service everything well you
could<00:03:30.930> probably<00:03:31.080> reach<00:03:31.440> down<00:03:31.710> I<00:03:31.740> think<00:03:31.980> it's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
could probably reach down I think it's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.950 
could probably reach down I think it's
actually<00:03:32.610> on<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.820> other<00:03:32.970> side<00:03:33.270> but<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.660> easy

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
actually on the other side but it's easy

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.670 
actually on the other side but it's easy
single<00:03:34.800> piece<00:03:35.520> hood<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:36.660> pops<00:03:37.020> with<00:03:37.350> really

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
single piece hood that pops with really

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.740 
single piece hood that pops with really
no<00:03:37.860> effort<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.940> allows<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.450> get<00:03:39.600> in

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
no effort and it allows you to get in

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.360 
no effort and it allows you to get in
and<00:03:39.990> change<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.290> oil<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.890> check<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.160> fluids

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and change the oil and check your fluids

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
and change the oil and check your fluids
pretty<00:03:41.910> easily<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.530> 17<00:03:44.010> 2016<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:46.020> just

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
pretty easily on the 17 2016 so you just
