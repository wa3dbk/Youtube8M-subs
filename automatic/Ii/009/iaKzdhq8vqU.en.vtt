00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
that initially have style is a long line

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.240 
that initially have style is a long line
courses<00:04:35.569> so<00:04:36.139> you<00:04:36.199> can<00:04:36.350> see<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.800> similar

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
courses so you can see this is similar

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.600 
courses so you can see this is similar
to<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:38.360> overbust<00:04:38.900> corset<00:04:39.500> where<00:04:40.099> it<00:04:40.370> covers

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
your chest and your torso but this one

your chest and your torso but this one
extends<00:04:44.690> further<00:04:45.050> down<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.680> hips<00:04:45.949> so<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.849> will

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
extends further down the hips so it will

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.070 
extends further down the hips so it will
cover<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.539> hips

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
cover the hips

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.200 
cover the hips
this<00:04:48.349> particular<00:04:48.860> corset<00:04:49.370> has<00:04:49.550> really<00:04:49.970> cool

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
this particular corset has really cool

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.230 
this particular corset has really cool
tails<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.169> back<00:04:51.349> so<00:04:52.009> it'll<00:04:52.099> even<00:04:52.580> cover<00:04:52.970> up

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
tails in the back so it'll even cover up

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.680 
tails in the back so it'll even cover up
the<00:04:53.770> derriere<00:04:54.770> section<00:04:55.490> blonde<00:04:55.910> line<00:04:56.120> corsets

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
the derriere section blonde line corsets

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.930 
the derriere section blonde line corsets
are<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.960> little<00:04:57.680> bit<00:04:57.860> harder<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.130> style<00:04:58.520> because

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
are a little bit harder to style because

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.629 
are a little bit harder to style because
I<00:04:59.060> do<00:04:59.120> extend<00:04:59.660> past<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.169> hip<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:00.979> certain

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
I do extend past the hip so certain

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.420 
I do extend past the hip so certain
dresses<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.270> skirts<00:05:02.419> won't<00:05:03.050> work<00:05:03.620> so<00:05:03.650> well<00:05:04.099> so

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
dresses and skirts won't work so well so

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.070 
dresses and skirts won't work so well so
this<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.330> how<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:06.020> style<00:05:06.979> online<00:05:07.699> courses<00:05:08.080> for

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
this is how I style online courses for

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.020 
this is how I style online courses for

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
long line corset you really want to keep

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.999 
long line corset you really want to keep
the<00:05:11.210> silhouette<00:05:11.720> figure<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:12.440> since<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
the silhouette figure and since the

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.300 
the silhouette figure and since the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
corset extends past the hips and you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.040 
corset extends past the hips and you
don't<00:05:16.699> really<00:05:16.880> want<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.210> wear<00:05:17.360> any<00:05:17.660> full

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.659 
don't really want to wear any full
skirts<00:05:18.590> because<00:05:19.009> I'm<00:05:19.130> just<00:05:19.250> going<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.520> add

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
skirts because I'm just going to add

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.960 
skirts because I'm just going to add
bulk<00:05:20.060> under<00:05:20.599> the<00:05:20.720> corset<00:05:21.259> so<00:05:21.889> it's<00:05:22.370> best<00:05:22.759> to

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
bulk under the corset so it's best to

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.689 
bulk under the corset so it's best to
wear<00:05:23.060> things<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.449> leggings<00:05:24.080> or<00:05:24.560> very<00:05:25.250> slim

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
wear things like leggings or very slim

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
trousers or even shorts or maybe a

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.879 
trousers or even shorts or maybe a
fitted<00:05:29.150> skirt<00:05:29.330> but<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:29.990> chose<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.409> wear<00:05:30.500> this

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889

particular one with some ripped up

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.080 
particular one with some ripped up
leggings<00:05:33.440> because<00:05:34.039> I<00:05:34.460> think<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.729> makes<00:05:34.909> like<00:05:35.060> a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090

and you know built clothes and

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.149 
and you know built clothes and
everything<00:05:43.849> so<00:05:44.659> it<00:05:44.810> feels<00:05:44.960> really<00:05:45.110> edgy<00:05:45.440> dark
