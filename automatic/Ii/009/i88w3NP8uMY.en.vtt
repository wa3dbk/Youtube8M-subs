the<00:00:10.530> country<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:10.889> well<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.700> newer<00:00:11.880> than

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the country as well but it is newer than

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.400 
the country as well but it is newer than
the<00:00:12.150> trout<00:00:12.330> magnet<00:00:12.660> right<00:00:13.139> there<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.349> how

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the trout magnet right there is how

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.930 
the trout magnet right there is how
we're<00:00:13.559> fishing<00:00:13.830> right<00:00:13.980> next<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.370> those<00:00:14.460> stumps

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
we're fishing right next to those stumps

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
we're fishing right next to those stumps
out<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.560> and<00:00:16.560> that's<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> key<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.130> can

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
out there and and that's the key you can

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.680 
out there and and that's the key you can
see<00:00:17.460> right<00:00:17.609> there<00:00:17.789> again<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.240> fishing<00:00:18.510> four

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
see right there again we're fishing four

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.120 
see right there again we're fishing four
or<00:00:18.779> five<00:00:18.960> feet<00:00:19.170> deep<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.470> kept<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.770> deeper

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
or five feet deep we kept going deeper

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.980 
or five feet deep we kept going deeper
and<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.310> caught<00:00:20.640> some<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.660> know<00:00:21.779> nine

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and actually caught some you know nine

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
and actually caught some you know nine
feet<00:00:22.320> deep<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.680> ten<00:00:22.859> feet<00:00:23.039> deep<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.730> think

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
feet deep and ten feet deep and I think

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.250 
feet deep and ten feet deep and I think
we<00:00:24.090> probably<00:00:24.240> should<00:00:24.420> even<00:00:24.750> try<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> even

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
we probably should even try to even

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.179 
we probably should even try to even
deeper<00:00:25.560> tightlining

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
deeper tightlining

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859 
deeper tightlining
but<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.060> that's<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.570> crappie

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
but and that's the thing with crappie

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.599 
but and that's the thing with crappie
you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.859> gear<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.279> start<00:00:29.490> out

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you know you get this gear you start out

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.830 
you know you get this gear you start out
with<00:00:29.699> four<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:29.970> six<00:00:30.150> pound<00:00:30.330> tests<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
with four and six pound tests on

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
with four and six pound tests on
something<00:00:31.170> light<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.650> jig<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.730> just

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
something light and a jig and then just

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.010 
something light and a jig and then just
fish<00:00:33.059> right<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> structure<00:00:33.870> they're

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
fish right up the structure they're

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
fish right up the structure they're
going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.980> next<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> structure

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
going to be right next to that structure

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
going to be right next to that structure
that's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:36.989> slap<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.829> oh
