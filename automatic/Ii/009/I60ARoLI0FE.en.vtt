death monkey actually for that idea

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.089 
death monkey actually for that idea
that's<00:02:30.700> what<00:02:30.760> he<00:02:30.909> used<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> NHL<00:02:31.870> 11

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
that's what he used to do in the NHL 11

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.440 
that's what he used to do in the NHL 11
um<00:02:33.099> cubed<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:34.629> but<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.959> was<00:02:35.049> four<00:02:35.200> packs<00:02:35.440> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
um cubed for but it was four packs so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.849

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
now that like that that's what I decided

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.289 
now that like that that's what I decided
to<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.579> thought<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.819> was<00:02:40.120> pretty

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
to do because I thought it was pretty

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.640 
to do because I thought it was pretty
cool<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.810> no<00:02:40.930> one's<00:02:41.079> really<00:02:41.200> doing<00:02:41.530> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
cool and no one's really doing that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770 
cool and no one's really doing that
anymore<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.760> actually<00:02:42.939> works<00:02:43.269> well<00:02:43.569> for

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
anymore and it actually works well for

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.740 
anymore and it actually works well for
