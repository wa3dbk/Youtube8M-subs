 hello that such friends today I'm going to 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.339
 teach how to prepare a steak 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.200
 gilt safely and easily 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:17.559
 to move the camera a little bit so that 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.559
 You can appreciate it right here in the table 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 Well look friends, let's start 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.930
 of the loin these are the fins 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.930
 slowly without hurry 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.900
 then we take away what is what 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 it's been the street in mathematics 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.720
 and now to be able to take out the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.720
 gut of maxima from the back 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.750
 we open it we are a little bit here the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.670
 gut 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 and we have it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.949
 this we throw to the garbage 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.560
 and we go on 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.240
 I previously already had it clean 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.000
 and we are going to proceed 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.000
 we follow first with one foot slowly 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 backward 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.590
 I do not know if you can see it we have 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.920

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.170
 with the thorn 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.659
 and we make a ligerito two strokes of one 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.549
 to two and we've already started the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 we continue with what the tip of the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.640
 knife 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.770

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 fillet 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.520

 we can use to make a broth 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.569
 to make a smoke quietly clear 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.150
 removing what part of the tail already 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.219
 then we save it, now we're going to 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.090
 what is being removed because of 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.090
 spines of the skirt 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.580

 we're going slowly 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.130
 and this garbage we scrape a little bit with what 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.160
 which is the part with the hardest part 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.450

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.570
 of the head to be able to break the thorn 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.740

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.740

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.790
