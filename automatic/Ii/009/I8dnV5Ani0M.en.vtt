yours no guns the same guns over and

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.019 
yours no guns the same guns over and
over<00:05:43.009> and<00:05:43.159> over<00:05:43.219> again<00:05:43.399> when<00:05:43.639> playing<00:05:43.849> gun

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
over and over again when playing gun

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.089 
over and over again when playing gun
master<00:05:44.239> because<00:05:44.629> half<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:45.229> guns<00:05:45.619> are<00:05:45.860> just

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099

absolute<00:05:46.759> garbage<00:05:46.999> and<00:05:47.569> it's<00:05:48.199> good<00:05:48.379> to<00:05:48.409> have<00:05:48.709> a

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
absolute garbage and it's good to have a

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.709 
absolute garbage and it's good to have a
surprise<00:05:49.429> element<00:05:50.029> to<00:05:50.179> the<00:05:50.300> game<00:05:50.329> because<00:05:50.599> you

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
surprise element to the game because you

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.569 
surprise element to the game because you
you<00:05:51.019> know<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.139> get<00:05:51.529> a<00:05:51.559> gun<00:05:51.769> you<00:05:52.099> kill<00:05:52.279> someone

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:52.579 
you know you get a gun you kill someone

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:54.549 
you know you get a gun you kill someone
and<00:05:52.879> then<00:05:52.939> you<00:05:53.240> go<00:05:53.360> okay<00:05:53.839> well<00:05:54.019> if<00:05:54.079> I<00:05:54.139> got<00:05:54.319> no

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.559 
and then you go okay well if I got no

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.889 
and then you go okay well if I got no
and<00:05:54.829> it<00:05:55.309> may<00:05:55.459> be<00:05:55.519> awful<00:05:55.969> it<00:05:56.119> may<00:05:56.240> be<00:05:56.300> amazing

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 
and it may be awful it may be amazing

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.249 
and it may be awful it may be amazing
but<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.499> think<00:05:58.039> it's<00:05:58.159> a<00:05:58.189> good<00:05:58.309> idea<00:05:58.519> and<00:05:58.759> I'm<00:05:58.879> the

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
but I think it's a good idea and I'm the

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.600 
but I think it's a good idea and I'm the
peroxidase<00:06:00.259> for<00:06:00.469> actually<00:06:00.919> given<00:06:01.249> is<00:06:01.369> this

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
peroxidase for actually given is this

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.699 
peroxidase for actually given is this
option<00:06:02.149> I<00:06:02.479> don't<00:06:02.899> know<00:06:03.019> why<00:06:03.169> they<00:06:03.319> didn't<00:06:03.649> just

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:03.709 
option I don't know why they didn't just

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.319 
option I don't know why they didn't just
give<00:06:03.979> us<00:06:04.129> this<00:06:04.309> option<00:06:04.699> in<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.909> first<00:06:05.179> place

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:05.329

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
why not that was really my thinking

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:25.629 
why not that was really my thinking
behind<00:06:23.479> doing<00:06:23.869> it<00:06:23.989> um<00:06:24.369> and<00:06:25.369> I'm<00:06:25.489> actually

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
behind doing it um and I'm actually

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.459 
behind doing it um and I'm actually
looking<00:06:25.999> forward<00:06:26.179> to<00:06:26.569> trying<00:06:26.689> that<00:06:26.959> game<00:06:27.169> I

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
looking forward to trying that game I

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:28.419 
looking forward to trying that game I
mean<00:06:27.619> I<00:06:27.709> know<00:06:27.739> it's<00:06:28.009> just<00:06:28.189> going<00:06:28.339> to<00:06:28.369> be

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:28.429 
mean I know it's just going to be

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.459 
mean I know it's just going to be
another<00:06:28.519> hospice<00:06:29.479> and<00:06:29.719> sugar<00:06:29.929> and<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.289> already

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
another hospice and sugar and I already

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.319 
another hospice and sugar and I already
have<00:06:30.739> a<00:06:30.769> bunch<00:06:31.069> of<00:06:31.219> those<00:06:31.369> but<00:06:31.669> you<00:06:31.879> know<00:06:32.300> I

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:32.329 
have a bunch of those but you know I

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:33.999 
have a bunch of those but you know I
think<00:06:32.689> it<00:06:32.809> has<00:06:32.959> the<00:06:32.989> potential<00:06:33.409> to<00:06:33.619> be<00:06:33.979> really

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
think it has the potential to be really

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.189 
think it has the potential to be really
good<00:06:34.550> so<00:06:34.879> I'm<00:06:35.149> looking<00:06:35.360> forward<00:06:35.659> to<00:06:35.779> trying<00:06:36.019> it

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
good so I'm looking forward to trying it

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.519 
good so I'm looking forward to trying it
I<00:06:36.319> was<00:06:36.679> a<00:06:36.709> fan<00:06:36.979> of<00:06:37.159> the<00:06:37.929> 2010<00:06:38.929> medal<00:06:39.289> of<00:06:39.349> honor

I was a fan of the 2010 medal of honor

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.339 
I was a fan of the 2010 medal of honor
but<00:06:40.189> obviously<00:06:40.969> it<00:06:41.329> had<00:06:41.479> as<00:06:41.659> far<00:06:41.959> as<00:06:42.079> when<00:06:42.229> it

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
but obviously it had as far as when it

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.350 
but obviously it had as far as when it
