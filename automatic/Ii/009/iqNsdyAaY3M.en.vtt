00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.390
 Hi guys 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.099
 of the simplex doctrine on the compressor 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.949
 let's see how it works bye then in the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 Today's simplex doctrine we talk about 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:40.110
 this compressor is the compressor here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.890
 it is a model of people from whom it refers 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.750
 mxr we use it also connecting it to a 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:54.670
 overdrive a fulton cd is a race 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.039
 analog that is always mxr is black le 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.989
 boe corus 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.390
 let's listen to the compressor first 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.390
 buster this is clean sound 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 insert 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:32.450
 one felt there is only an increase of 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:35.330
 volume that helps helps to give a 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 slight saturation at the stadium 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.500
 amplifier input 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.480
 we increase the sustain level or 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.200
 compression by lowering a bit in 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.200
 level back to the clean sound 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.039
 and insert the compressor 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 as you hear, the body of the stamp increases 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 background noise also increases 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.310
 the attack is slightly modified 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.310
 let's try resent without a compressor 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.420
 with the compressor 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.989
 now we feel the decay 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.989
 of the first note without a compressor 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480
 and then with the compressor 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.860
 that how to feel much longer and 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:30.870
 sustained precisely we put the level of 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:35.840
 maximum sensitivity to exasperate the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.840
 differences without compressor 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.970
 with compressor 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.200
 let's go back to a little more regulation 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200
 Quiet 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.319
 no 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 no 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.289
 let's do the same tour without 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.980
 and now we see two applications 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.660
 typical of the compressor 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.260
 the first is accompanied by a korjus 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.260
 so essence 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.260
 and so here 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.080
 in the second and to give a little more 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.940
 push all over drive 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.940
 this is the sound without a compressor 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.880
 and this is the sound with the compressor
