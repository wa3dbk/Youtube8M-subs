00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.520 
a bunch of reasons for why he might have
that<00:03:33.610> crazy<00:03:33.940> turn<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.660> they<00:03:34.960> found<00:03:34.990> all<00:03:35.350> these

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
that crazy turn and they found all these

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.890 
that crazy turn and they found all these
ways<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:35.950> illustrate<00:03:36.460> them<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.880> it's<00:03:37.390> it's

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
ways to illustrate them and it's it's

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.530 
ways to illustrate them and it's it's
just<00:03:38.200> kind<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.530> nutty<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.640> really<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.240> it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
just kind of nutty and I really think it

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.510

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
probably was better at that an original

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
probably was better at that an original
