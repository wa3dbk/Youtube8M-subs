00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
probably the our tree but I'm really I

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.130 
probably the our tree but I'm really I
use<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> net<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:26.720> really<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
use a net and just really what I do I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.970 
use a net and just really what I do I
just<00:00:28.289> move<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> metal<00:00:30.000> ticker

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.900 
just move it around like a metal ticker
and<00:00:31.980> though<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.669> pop-up<00:00:33.380> little<00:00:34.380> jump

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
and though this pop-up little jump

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.720 
and though this pop-up little jump
someone<00:00:35.910> will<00:00:36.090> make<00:00:36.210> noise<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:38.270> um<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> I'm
