00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.670
 In the glass mastering a reader writes the 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:18.890
 data on a specially coated 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.259
 glass plate is subsequently in a 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.830
 galvanic bat the so-called stampa 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.830
 generated 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.010
 the tempo is a negative imprint of the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.740
 data information 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.830
 he is made of pure nickel with him 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.090
 can be pressed later about 80,000 dvds 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.790
 be in a complicated procedure 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.080
 the stampa surface becomes multiple 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.580
 chemically cleaned very last 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.000
 Contaminations are caused by 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.440
 Irradiation with UV light eliminated 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.050
 absolute cleanliness is at the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.050
 generation of this matrix the a and o 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.680
 starting material of a dvd is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.690
 polycarbonate from these big bags 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 the plastic becomes over vacuum 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 piping directly to the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960
 promoted production facilities 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.650
 The granulate is in an extruder 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.380
 heated and sprayed in a mold 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.830
 this form consists of the annealing side 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.770
 and the mirror side, let's have a look 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.450
 The whole once stood in the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 on the one side we see the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.070
 stamp on the other the mirrors 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.970
 plate and in the middle the finished one 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.000
 slice is 06 mm thick and still completely 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.900
 transparent on the disc are already 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900
 all data available 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.259
 each dvd consists of two half slices 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:02:00.380
 the leo 0 and the teacher once at one 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.560
 dvd 5, the low 1 contains no data 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.829
 at a dvd 9 will be on both half 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.110
 Write data pressed with it 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.459
 dvd player the data from a dvd 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.379
 can read 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.190
 while half slicing with one 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:21.049
 aluminum layer provided with turned 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.000
 glued to the second teacher and under 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.000
 a uv lamp hardens 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.769
 still in the machine, every dvd is on 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.769
 optical errors by means of a scanner 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.769
 checked 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.740
 In addition, every 500c dvd 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.290
 all checked again 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.120
 electrical values ​​within 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.180
 specified limits, the dvd 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.360
 for printing so no wrong dvds 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.710
 will be printed the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.200
 order-related barcode every dvd 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.360
 read 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.370
 to improve the color intensity 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.830
 the dvd with white full area 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.980
 it will be pre-printed afterwards 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.870
 appropriate motif printed if the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.680
 Customer desires a protective varnish 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.680
 upset 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.190
 depending on your wishes, it will only be 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.190
 packed up 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.230
 Either just in a paper bag or 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.230
 a little more elaborate eg in a cool box
