00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
need well there are two modules I'd like

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.730 
need well there are two modules I'd like
to<00:00:32.820> show<00:00:32.970> today<00:00:33.330> I<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:34.110> them<00:00:34.230> faster<00:00:34.560> than

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
to show today I want them faster than

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.070 
to show today I want them faster than
the<00:00:34.860> other<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.940> we'll<00:00:36.120> start<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> faster

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
the other so we'll start with the faster

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.040 
the other so we'll start with the faster
one<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.240> put<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> repeater<00:00:39.630> here

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
one so we want to put a repeater here

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
one so we want to put a repeater here
like<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.740> repeater<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.710> put<00:00:43.940> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
like this and repeater like this put to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.190 
like this and repeater like this put to
dust<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.630> here<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:47.150> we'll<00:00:48.150> want<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> torch<00:00:51.200> so

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
dust over here and we'll want a torch so

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.410 
dust over here and we'll want a torch so
there's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> torch<00:00:53.130> and<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.790> all<00:00:54.060> lit<00:00:54.300> up

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's a torch and that's all lit up

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290 
there's a torch and that's all lit up
now<00:00:55.350> quickly<00:00:55.680> remove<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.790> replace<00:00:56.940> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
now quickly remove and replace this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.100 
now quickly remove and replace this
redstone<00:00:57.690> here

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
redstone here

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.009 
redstone here
and<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:59.790> makes<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.270> extremely<00:01:01.050> laggy<00:01:01.320> device

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
and it makes a extremely laggy device

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.219 
and it makes a extremely laggy device
just<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:05.069> fast<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.549> pulsing<00:01:06.229> let's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
just to see how fast it's pulsing let's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
just to see how fast it's pulsing let's
use<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> trapdoor<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:09.469> not

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
use a trapdoor or not

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.930 
use a trapdoor or not
it's<00:01:12.870> fast<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.500> next<00:01:16.740> thing<00:01:17.010> we'll<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.910> is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
it's fast so the next thing we'll do is

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.780 
it's fast so the next thing we'll do is
we'll<00:01:18.450> build<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> second<00:01:19.500> version<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we'll build the second version of this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.750 
we'll build the second version of this
device<00:01:22.160> sorry<00:01:23.160> about<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
device sorry about that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.060 
device sorry about that
second<00:01:24.690> version<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.260> device<00:01:27.590> almost<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
second version of this device almost is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.060 
second version of this device almost is
good<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.730> doesn't<00:01:29.940> pulse<00:01:30.330> as<00:01:30.540> fast<00:01:31.070> but

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
good but it doesn't pulse as fast but

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.200 
good but it doesn't pulse as fast but
nonetheless<00:01:33.860> nonetheless<00:01:34.860> Oh<00:01:35.730> what's<00:01:36.150> wrong

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
nonetheless nonetheless Oh what's wrong

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
nonetheless nonetheless Oh what's wrong

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
ulcer

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.170 
ulcer
now<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> torches<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.320> burn<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.830> but<00:01:59.369> not

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
all of them at the same time so it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
all of them at the same time so it's
gonna<00:02:02.100> keep<00:02:02.369> running<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.930> fast
