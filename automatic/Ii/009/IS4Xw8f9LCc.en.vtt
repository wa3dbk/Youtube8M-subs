00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.230 

3d<00:00:36.440> printing<00:00:36.830> has<00:00:36.860> been<00:00:37.010> around<00:00:37.430> for<00:00:38.090> almost

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
3d printing has been around for almost

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.020 
3d printing has been around for almost
25<00:00:38.750> years<00:00:38.780> now<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.250> long<00:00:40.460> time<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:41.000> was

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
25 years now but for a long time it was

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.140 
25 years now but for a long time it was
used<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:41.930> engineers<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.530> by<00:00:42.800> engineers<00:00:43.400> for

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
used for engineers and by engineers for

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.420 
used for engineers and by engineers for
prototyping<00:00:44.540> new<00:00:45.530> products<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.190> they<00:00:46.280> would

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
prototyping new products that they would

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.300 
prototyping new products that they would
then<00:00:46.610> mass-produce<00:00:47.030> what<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:47.900> did<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:48.350> 2007<00:00:49.070> is

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
then mass-produce what we did in 2007 is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.030 
then mass-produce what we did in 2007 is
we<00:00:49.460> realized<00:00:49.940> basically<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.720> hey<00:00:50.900> why<00:00:51.650> don't

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
we realized basically that hey why don't

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.250 
we realized basically that hey why don't
we<00:00:52.190> use<00:00:52.400> this<00:00:52.640> amazing<00:00:53.150> technology<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:54.080> give

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
we use this amazing technology to give

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.340 
we use this amazing technology to give
anyone<00:00:54.770> access<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.970> manufacturing<00:00:56.600> why<00:00:57.140> don't

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
anyone access to manufacturing why don't

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.080 
anyone access to manufacturing why don't
we<00:00:57.440> use<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.770> technology<00:00:58.070> these<00:00:58.489> 3d<00:00:58.790> printers

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
we use this technology these 3d printers

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.400 
we use this technology these 3d printers
to<00:00:59.150> make<00:00:59.510> actual<00:01:00.020> final<00:01:00.320> products<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:06.110> 3d

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
technology the same way that you might

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.260 
technology the same way that you might
carve<00:01:09.830> something<00:01:10.220> out<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.460> wax<00:01:10.700> or<00:01:11.030> make<00:01:11.240> a

is<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.750> same<00:01:15.020> way<00:01:15.170> now<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.410> might<00:01:15.770> sit<00:01:15.979> down

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
is the same way now you might sit down

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.270 
is the same way now you might sit down
at<00:01:16.250> your<00:01:16.280> computer<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.820> use<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> CAD<00:01:17.960> program

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
at your computer and use a CAD program

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.249 
at your computer and use a CAD program
like<00:01:19.280> Rhino<00:01:19.610> or<00:01:19.759> our<00:01:20.270> maiya<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.960> sculpt

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
like Rhino or our maiya to sculpt

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.160 
like Rhino or our maiya to sculpt
something<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.979> then<00:01:22.190> print<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:22.910> out<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.900> for

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
something and then print it out so for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.830 
something and then print it out so for
me<00:01:24.430> 3d<00:01:25.430> printing<00:01:25.759> was<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.300> way<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.540> bring

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
me 3d printing was a way to bring

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.170 
me 3d printing was a way to bring
together<00:01:27.020> art<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.950> science<00:01:28.340> like<00:01:28.640> I<00:01:28.880> was<00:01:29.000> able

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
together art and science like I was able

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.359 
together art and science like I was able
to<00:01:29.330> express<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.470> artistic<00:01:30.830> thing<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.340> I

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
to express the artistic thing that I

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.219 
to express the artistic thing that I
could<00:01:31.580> see<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:31.880> my<00:01:32.000> head<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:32.479> use<00:01:32.750> really

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
could see in my head but use really

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.910 
could see in my head but use really
precise<00:01:33.740> techniques<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.170> technology<00:01:36.170> to

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
precise techniques and and technology to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.970 
precise techniques and and technology to
realize<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:41.960> understand<00:01:42.470> 3d

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
realize that if you understand 3d

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.940 
realize that if you understand 3d
printing<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.550> me<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.120> deposition<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.320> or

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
printing to me the deposition and or

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.880 
printing to me the deposition and or
fusing<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.790> material<00:01:47.450> by<00:01:47.750> layer<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.620> really

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
fusing of material by layer it really

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.890 
fusing of material by layer it really
opens<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.370> what<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.850> could<00:01:50.180> consider<00:01:50.510> 3d

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
opens up what you could consider 3d

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.630 
opens up what you could consider 3d
printing<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.380> be<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.740> think<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.280> most

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
printing to be I think the most

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.160 
printing to be I think the most
interesting<00:01:52.790> advancements<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.810> terms<00:01:53.990> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
interesting advancements in terms of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.080 
interesting advancements in terms of
where<00:01:54.440> 3d<00:01:54.710> printing<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.580> going

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
where 3d printing is and is going

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.820 
where 3d printing is and is going
have<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.600> do<00:01:56.720> with<00:01:56.800> dimensionality<00:01:57.800> and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
have to do with dimensionality and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.260 
have to do with dimensionality and
materials<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.290> both<00:02:00.290> at<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.530> small<00:02:00.800> scale<00:02:00.950> of

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
materials so both at the small scale of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.789 
materials so both at the small scale of
dimensions<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.600> large<00:02:02.810> scale<00:02:02.990> like

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
dimensions and the large scale like

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.890 
dimensions and the large scale like
people<00:02:04.159> are<00:02:04.310> getting<00:02:04.729> parts<00:02:05.120> scanned<00:02:05.659> in

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
people are getting parts scanned in

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.160 
people are getting parts scanned in
their<00:02:06.020> body<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.920> get<00:02:07.010> custom<00:02:08.019> implants<00:02:09.019> made

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
their body to get custom implants made

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.680 
their body to get custom implants made
for<00:02:10.160> like<00:02:10.489> if<00:02:11.090> they're<00:02:11.239> having<00:02:11.360> heart

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
for like if they're having heart

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
for like if they're having heart
troubles<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.200> things<00:02:12.320> like<00:02:12.440> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
troubles and things like that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
troubles and things like that
or<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> very<00:02:15.030> very<00:02:15.180> big<00:02:15.450> scale<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
or at the very very big scale like the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.010 
or at the very very big scale like the
large<00:02:17.100> gantry<00:02:17.520> mounted<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.660> building

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
large gantry mounted kind of building

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.330 
large gantry mounted kind of building
scale<00:02:19.260> applications<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.040> those<00:02:20.220> are

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
scale applications I think those are

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.820 
scale applications I think those are
really<00:02:20.460> interesting<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.180> then<00:02:21.710> shifting<00:02:22.710> out

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
really interesting and then shifting out

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.640 
really interesting and then shifting out
of<00:02:23.330> plastics<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.630> things<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.930> ceramics

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
of plastics into things like ceramics

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.630 
of plastics into things like ceramics
like<00:02:26.610> other<00:02:27.890> biological<00:02:28.890> materials<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
like other biological materials that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.920 
like other biological materials that
people<00:02:29.820> are<00:02:30.000> looking<00:02:30.270> at<00:02:30.360> printing<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
people are looking at printing and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.040 
people are looking at printing and
really<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.740> opens<00:02:32.070> up<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:33.150> 3d<00:02:33.570> printing<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
really that opens up what 3d printing is

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
really that opens up what 3d printing is
and<00:02:34.320> what<00:02:34.710> its<00:02:35.010> applications<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.210> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and what its applications can be in a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.140 
and what its applications can be in a
kind<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.260> exponential<00:02:37.860> rate<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.700> terms<00:02:38.940> of

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
kind of exponential rate in terms of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.090 
kind of exponential rate in terms of
where<00:02:39.420> would<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.380> what<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.860> would<00:02:40.920> do

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
where would go and what you would do

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.140 
where would go and what you would do
with<00:02:41.190> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.450 

it's<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.270> good<00:02:48.450> time<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:49.460> experimentation

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
it's a good time for experimentation

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.250 
it's a good time for experimentation
it's<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.790> good<00:02:50.970> time<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> think<00:02:51.480> about<00:02:51.630> how

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
it's a good time to think about how

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.560 
it's a good time to think about how
something<00:02:52.620> that's<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.190> old<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.150> clothing

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
something that's as old as the clothing

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.870 
something that's as old as the clothing
industry<00:02:55.020> could<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.310> redefined<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.700> new

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
industry could be redefined with new

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.520 
industry could be redefined with new
technologies<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:59.340> use<00:02:59.400> digital<00:03:00.120> fabrication

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
technologies we use digital fabrication

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.740 
technologies we use digital fabrication
technologies<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.920> software<00:03:02.820> techniques<00:03:03.270> to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
technologies and software techniques to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.740 
technologies and software techniques to
invent<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:04.770> fashion<00:03:05.190> design<00:03:05.490> means<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.390> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
invent what fashion design means for a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
invent what fashion design means for a
digital<00:03:07.200> age<00:03:08.840> artists<00:03:09.840> are<00:03:09.930> always<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.470> early

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
digital age artists are always the early

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.400 
digital age artists are always the early
adopters<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:12.090> essentially<00:03:12.420> want<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
adopters we essentially want to be the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.470 
adopters we essentially want to be the
first<00:03:14.450> fashion<00:03:15.450> label<00:03:15.810> that's<00:03:16.110> software<00:03:17.480> we

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
first fashion label that's software we

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.900 
first fashion label that's software we
started<00:03:18.870> working<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.590> 3d<00:03:20.160> printing<00:03:20.640> because

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
started working with 3d printing because

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.510 
started working with 3d printing because
we<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.660> idea<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.290> could<00:03:22.920> we<00:03:22.950> make

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
we like this idea of like could we make

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.150 
we like this idea of like could we make
clothing<00:03:24.120> without<00:03:24.570> sewing<00:03:25.440> having<00:03:25.770> one

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
clothing without sewing having one

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.060 
clothing without sewing having one
machine<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.239> make<00:03:27.650> really<00:03:28.650> impossible

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
machine that can make really impossible

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.070 
machine that can make really impossible
shapes<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.380> huge<00:03:31.620> benefit<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.900> is

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
shapes is it's a huge benefit so this is

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.680 
shapes is it's a huge benefit so this is
a<00:03:34.260> 3d<00:03:34.709> printed<00:03:35.100> bikini<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.120> design<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
a 3d printed bikini so design of the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.630 
a 3d printed bikini so design of the
bikini<00:03:37.020> was<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.560> about<00:03:37.800> designing<00:03:38.489> this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
bikini was really about designing this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.600 
bikini was really about designing this
generative<00:03:39.209> textile<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.930> designing<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.860> way

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
generative textile like designing a way

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.320 
generative textile like designing a way
for<00:03:42.300> 3d<00:03:43.140> printed<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.770> be<00:03:43.950> almost<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.790> fabric

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
for 3d printed to be almost like fabric

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.590 
for 3d printed to be almost like fabric
and<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.560> flexible<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.430> fit<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.390> body

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
and it be flexible and fit to the body

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.070 
and it be flexible and fit to the body
and<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.650> how<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.190> done<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.959> after<00:03:51.959> we

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and so how this is done is after we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.280 
and so how this is done is after we
modeled<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.980> 3d<00:03:53.550> shape<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.390> actually<00:03:54.930> fills

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
modeled this 3d shape it actually fills

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.590 
modeled this 3d shape it actually fills
the<00:03:55.650> surface<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.430> want<00:03:56.700> with<00:03:57.060> this

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the surface that you want with this

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.350 
the surface that you want with this
geometry<00:03:58.020> that<00:03:58.560> creates<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.459> fabric<00:04:00.090> like

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
geometry that creates this fabric like

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.470 
geometry that creates this fabric like
structure<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.380> packs<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.190> circles<00:04:02.670> closer

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
structure it packs the circles closer

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.930 
structure it packs the circles closer
and<00:04:03.930> smaller<00:04:04.290> at<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> edges<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.580> then

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
and smaller at the edges and then

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.030 
and smaller at the edges and then
towards<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.360> middle<00:04:07.140> sections<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.890> have

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
towards the middle sections you have

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.070 
towards the middle sections you have
bigger<00:04:08.250> circles<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.600> nice<00:04:09.780> because

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
bigger circles and this is nice because

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.229 
bigger circles and this is nice because
it<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:10.739> looks<00:04:11.130> interesting<00:04:11.910> for<00:04:12.209> a

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
it actually like looks interesting for a

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.600 
it actually like looks interesting for a
bikini<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.050> its<00:04:13.170> aesthetic<00:04:14.160> as<00:04:14.310> well<00:04:14.519> as

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
bikini and its aesthetic as well as

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.249 
bikini and its aesthetic as well as
functional

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.529 

so<00:04:17.560> we've<00:04:17.769> done<00:04:17.979> some<00:04:18.310> work<00:04:18.340> with<00:04:18.519> 3d<00:04:19.090> printing

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
so we've done some work with 3d printing

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.779 
so we've done some work with 3d printing
we<00:04:20.259> felt<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.620> people<00:04:21.160> really<00:04:21.370> understood

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
we felt that people really understood

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.420 
we felt that people really understood
shoes<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.600> our<00:04:22.960> goals<00:04:23.229> is<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.530> actually<00:04:23.800> have

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
shoes so our goals is to actually have

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.430 
shoes so our goals is to actually have
like<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.669> dedicated<00:04:25.180> shoe<00:04:25.539> printer<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.139> store

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
like a dedicated shoe printer in a store

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.839 
like a dedicated shoe printer in a store
and<00:04:26.470> then<00:04:26.770> people<00:04:27.009> could<00:04:27.280> like<00:04:27.400> print<00:04:27.699> their

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
and then people could like print their

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.790 
and then people could like print their
shoes<00:04:28.090> or<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.930> could<00:04:29.080> even<00:04:29.169> have<00:04:29.470> like

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
shoes or you could even have like

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.189 
shoes or you could even have like
basically<00:04:30.699> a<00:04:30.849> printer<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.270> would<00:04:31.389> buy<00:04:31.599> just

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
basically a printer you would buy just

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.230 
basically a printer you would buy just
to<00:04:32.440> be<00:04:33.069> able<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.250> make<00:04:33.460> yourself<00:04:33.910> as<00:04:34.060> many

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
to be able to make yourself as many

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.610 
to be able to make yourself as many
shoes<00:04:34.569> as<00:04:34.599> you<00:04:34.870> want<00:04:39.930> inspiration<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.169> think<00:04:41.500> is

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
shoes as you want inspiration I think is

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.020 
shoes as you want inspiration I think is
one<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.889> things<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.340> most<00:04:42.520> people<00:04:42.880> need

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
one of the things that most people need

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.820 
one of the things that most people need
to<00:04:43.210> really<00:04:43.479> get<00:04:43.690> started<00:04:43.840> especially<00:04:44.440> with

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
to really get started especially with

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.800 
to really get started especially with
new<00:04:44.949> technology<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.819> now<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.630> we've

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
new technology so now what we've

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.650 
new technology so now what we've
therefore<00:04:47.380> created<00:04:47.800> our<00:04:48.000> creators<00:04:49.000> encode

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
therefore created our creators encode

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.629 
therefore created our creators encode
and<00:04:49.870> our<00:04:49.990> co-creation<00:04:50.410> platform<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.280> where

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
and our co-creation platform is where

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.640 
and our co-creation platform is where

the one thing that's really interesting
about<00:05:16.720> this<00:05:16.960> technology<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:18.699> more

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
about this technology is that it's more

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.879 
about this technology is that it's more
accessible<00:05:19.259> because<00:05:20.259> it's<00:05:20.500> more<00:05:20.650> accessible

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
accessible because it's more accessible

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.230 
accessible because it's more accessible
it's<00:05:21.280> not<00:05:21.400> only<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.669> hardware<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:22.120> more

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
it's not only the hardware it's more

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.450 
it's not only the hardware it's more
accessible<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:23.560> also<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.889> language<00:05:24.280> that

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
accessible it's also the language that

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.370 
accessible it's also the language that
it's<00:05:24.580> coding<00:05:24.970> been<00:05:25.630> coded<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.080> is<00:05:26.229> more

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
it's coding been coded in is more

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.950 
it's coding been coded in is more
accessible<00:05:26.729> also<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:28.240> learning<00:05:28.360> resources

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
accessible also the learning resources

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.240 
accessible also the learning resources
that<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.259> need<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.500> be<00:05:29.590> able<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.979> do<00:05:30.130> it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
that you need to be able to do it

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.490 
that you need to be able to do it
yourself<00:05:30.610> is<00:05:30.729> also<00:05:31.060> more<00:05:31.240> accessible<00:05:31.500> right

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
yourself is also more accessible right

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.459 
yourself is also more accessible right
so<00:05:32.680> now<00:05:32.860> all<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.099> a<00:05:33.310> sudden<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:34.509> big<00:05:35.169> walls

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
so now all of a sudden the big walls

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.589 
so now all of a sudden the big walls
that<00:05:35.770> existed<00:05:36.190> before<00:05:36.520> in<00:05:36.550> terms<00:05:36.849> of<00:05:37.090> who<00:05:37.270> had

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
that existed before in terms of who had

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:38.879 
that existed before in terms of who had
the<00:05:37.690> privilege<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.229> being<00:05:38.409> able<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:38.680> create

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
the privilege of being able to create

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.490 
the privilege of being able to create
what<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.550> largely<00:05:39.820> dictate<00:05:40.419> how<00:05:40.840> people<00:05:41.259> used

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
what and largely dictate how people used

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.129 
what and largely dictate how people used
it<00:05:41.650> or<00:05:42.039> gone<00:05:42.400> but<00:05:43.360> again<00:05:43.570> I<00:05:43.599> mean<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.840> think<00:05:43.930> it

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
it or gone but again I mean I think it

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.159 
it or gone but again I mean I think it
just<00:05:44.259> goes<00:05:44.469> down<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.889> fact<00:05:45.099> that<00:05:45.159> you<00:05:45.880> know

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
just goes down to the fact that you know

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.749 
just goes down to the fact that you know
information<00:05:47.169> is<00:05:47.530> everywhere<00:05:47.889> now<00:05:48.099> everyone

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
information is everywhere now everyone

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.089 
information is everywhere now everyone
has<00:05:48.880> access<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.509> and<00:05:49.810> it's<00:05:50.169> very<00:05:50.380> easy<00:05:50.469> to

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
has access to it and it's very easy to

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.730 
has access to it and it's very easy to
do<00:05:51.219> whatever<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.639> want<00:05:51.849> with<00:05:52.060> it

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.980 

the<00:05:56.740> technology<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.520> exists<00:05:57.849> today<00:05:57.969> it<00:05:58.810> also

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
the technology that exists today it also

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.290 
the technology that exists today it also
shapes<00:05:59.469> the<00:06:00.310> way<00:06:00.430> that<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.699> think<00:06:00.820> about<00:06:01.090> what

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
shapes the way that you think about what

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.379 
shapes the way that you think about what
the<00:06:01.599> possibilities<00:06:02.409> of<00:06:02.440> tomorrow<00:06:02.650> might<00:06:03.070> be

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
the possibilities of tomorrow might be

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.659 
the possibilities of tomorrow might be
you<00:06:04.389> know<00:06:04.479> so<00:06:04.630> if<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:04.960> have<00:06:05.080> a<00:06:05.110> great<00:06:05.380> idea

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
you know so if you have a great idea

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.850 
you know so if you have a great idea
that<00:06:06.669> idea<00:06:07.060> might<00:06:07.330> not<00:06:07.479> be<00:06:07.599> ready<00:06:07.840> to<00:06:08.050> come

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
that idea might not be ready to come

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.040 
that idea might not be ready to come
into<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.130> world<00:06:09.280> yet<00:06:09.550> until<00:06:10.509> there's<00:06:10.960> a

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
into the world yet until there's a

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.709 
into the world yet until there's a
mechanism<00:06:11.469> put<00:06:11.800> in<00:06:11.889> place<00:06:12.130> right<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:13.449> makes

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
mechanism put in place right that makes

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.080 
mechanism put in place right that makes
that<00:06:13.870> idea<00:06:14.320> now<00:06:14.889> realizable

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.240 

people<00:06:19.090> are<00:06:19.240> comparing<00:06:19.750> the<00:06:20.379> 3d<00:06:20.889> printing

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
people are comparing the 3d printing

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.879 
people are comparing the 3d printing
revolution<00:06:21.849> to<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.860> revolution<00:06:23.860> that

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
revolution to the revolution that

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
happened with personal computing I don't

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.230 
happened with personal computing I don't
necessarily<00:06:26.080> think<00:06:26.650> there'll<00:06:27.219> be<00:06:27.250> a<00:06:27.819> 3d

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
necessarily think there'll be a 3d

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.429 
necessarily think there'll be a 3d
printer<00:06:28.569> in<00:06:28.629> every<00:06:28.870> home<00:06:29.080> but<00:06:29.349> I<00:06:29.379> think

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:29.439 
printer in every home but I think

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.529 
printer in every home but I think
there'll<00:06:30.159> be<00:06:30.189> a<00:06:30.310> 3d<00:06:30.699> printed<00:06:30.969> product<00:06:31.389> in

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
there'll be a 3d printed product in

there'll be a 3d printed product in
every<00:06:31.780> home<00:06:31.930> there'll<00:06:32.289> be<00:06:32.319> an<00:06:32.650> application

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
every home there'll be an application

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.150
