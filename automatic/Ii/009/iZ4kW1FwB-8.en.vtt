00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
alright this is rob rock jam guitar and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.950 
alright this is rob rock jam guitar and
today<00:00:13.910> we're<00:00:14.150> going<00:00:14.180> to<00:00:14.330> be<00:00:14.480> talking<00:00:14.660> about

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.490 
today we're going to be talking about
playing<00:00:15.890> drop<00:00:16.519> d<00:00:16.970> okay<00:00:17.539> what<00:00:18.019> is<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.320> whole

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
playing drop d okay what is the whole

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.700 
playing drop d okay what is the whole
drop<00:00:18.920> D<00:00:19.340> tuning<00:00:19.840> it's<00:00:20.840> whenever<00:00:21.200> you<00:00:21.289> get<00:00:21.440> your

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
drop D tuning it's whenever you get your

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.210 
drop D tuning it's whenever you get your
low<00:00:21.980> E<00:00:22.280> string<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:23.449> did<00:00:23.750> you<00:00:23.960> too<00:00:24.320> d<00:00:24.619> so

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
low E string and you did you too d so

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.790 
low E string and you did you too d so
then<00:00:25.400> your<00:00:25.520> strings<00:00:25.880> are<00:00:26.029> going<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.240> become<00:00:26.360> e

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
then your strings are going to become e

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.270 
then your strings are going to become e
b<00:00:27.880> g<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.600> bay<00:00:30.410> in<00:00:30.820> da<00:00:31.820> ok<00:00:32.689> which<00:00:33.320> which<00:00:34.100> is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
b g the bay in da ok which which is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.069 
b g the bay in da ok which which is
really<00:00:34.519> cool<00:00:34.819> to<00:00:35.059> play<00:00:35.269> and<00:00:35.569> come<00:00:35.749> up<00:00:35.899> with

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
really cool to play and come up with

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.719 
really cool to play and come up with
ribs<00:00:36.559> for<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.039> because<00:00:37.219> now<00:00:37.579> if<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:37.909> play<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
ribs for it because now if you play the

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.349 
ribs for it because now if you play the
doping<00:00:40.729> sweeter<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.710> d.j<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.069> then<00:00:43.460> be<00:00:43.729> you

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
doping sweeter the d.j and then be you

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.419 
doping sweeter the d.j and then be you
really<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:44.899> me<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.469> power<00:00:45.800> cord<00:00:48.429> really

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
really for me in the power cord really

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.250 
really for me in the power cord really
right<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:49.819> that<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:50.600> if<00:00:50.719> you<00:00:50.839> remember

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
right on that and then if you remember

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.229 
right on that and then if you remember
your<00:00:51.440> theory<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.219> whole<00:00:52.670> steps<00:00:52.999> and<00:00:53.149> half

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
your theory of the whole steps and half

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.389 
your theory of the whole steps and half
steps<00:00:53.389> you<00:00:53.839> have<00:00:53.870> half<00:00:54.229> step<00:00:54.499> between<00:00:54.679> E<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:55.069> F

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
steps you have half step between E and F

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.509 
steps you have half step between E and F
and<00:00:55.699> B<00:00:55.729> and<00:00:56.269> C<00:00:56.659> you<00:00:57.199> can<00:00:57.229> form<00:00:57.709> different<00:00:58.010> power

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
and B and C you can form different power

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.020 
and B and C you can form different power
cords<00:00:59.030> there<00:00:59.239> so<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.659> a<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:01.339> power<00:01:01.670> cord

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
cords there so this is a the power cord

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.470 
cords there so this is a the power cord
you<00:01:02.389> go<00:01:02.569> a<00:01:02.600> whole<00:01:02.839> step<00:01:03.109> 2<00:01:03.469> e<00:01:04.750> have<00:01:05.750> step<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.409> F

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
you go a whole step 2 e have step to F

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.420 
you go a whole step 2 e have step to F
whole<00:01:08.480> step<00:01:08.840> 2<00:01:09.110> G<00:01:09.910> whole<00:01:10.910> step<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:12.430> can

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
whole step 2 G whole step to a can

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.580 
whole step 2 G whole step to a can
remember<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.570> can<00:01:14.780> also<00:01:14.960> play<00:01:15.350> your

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
remember that you can also play your

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.640 
remember that you can also play your
flats<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.070> sharps<00:01:16.280> there<00:01:16.550> so<00:01:16.820> if<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.330> a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
flats and sharps there so if this is a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.010 
flats and sharps there so if this is a
you<00:01:18.650> can<00:01:18.830> go<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.160> flat<00:01:20.230> or<00:01:21.230> a<00:01:21.260> charm<00:01:22.060> then<00:01:23.060> be<00:01:23.950> c

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
you can go a flat or a charm then be c

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.490 
you can go a flat or a charm then be c
and<00:01:26.380> then<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.149> okay<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.479> it's<00:01:28.780> really<00:01:28.869> good

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
and then the okay and it's really good

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.230 
and then the okay and it's really good
to<00:01:29.530> come<00:01:29.859> up<00:01:30.070> with<00:01:30.100> some<00:01:30.460> kind<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.700> hard<00:01:31.000> rock

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
to come up with some kind of hard rock

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.389 
to come up with some kind of hard rock
or<00:01:31.600> metal<00:01:31.859> reacts<00:01:32.859> there<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.860> super<00:01:39.100> easy<00:01:39.130> to

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
or metal reacts there it's super easy to

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.609 
or metal reacts there it's super easy to
do<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:40.299> in<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.509> case<00:01:40.750> here<00:01:41.020> I'm<00:01:41.109> just<00:01:41.140> plain

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
do so in this case here I'm just plain

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.270 
do so in this case here I'm just plain
they<00:01:41.829> eat<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:43.270> I'm<00:01:43.450> going<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.899> app<00:01:44.280> then

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
they eat then I'm going to the app then

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.300 
they eat then I'm going to the app then
G<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.329> then<00:01:46.659> I'm<00:01:46.810> going<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.259> power<00:01:47.560> cord<00:01:47.979> here

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
G and then I'm going a power cord here

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.800 
G and then I'm going a power cord here
on<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:48.939> string<00:01:49.119> with<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.049> sea<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:52.479> we<00:01:52.659> can

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
on the a string with the sea and we can

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.750 
on the a string with the sea and we can
do<00:01:52.959> like<00:01:53.170> thousand<00:01:53.950> different<00:01:54.069> drafts<00:01:54.579> like

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.970 

so<00:01:59.940> I'm<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.210> doing<00:02:00.450> d<00:02:00.690> now<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.950> going

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
so I'm just doing d now and then going

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.290 
so I'm just doing d now and then going
out<00:02:03.980> G<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.400> really<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.910> go<00:02:06.030> kind

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
out G and if you really want to go kind

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.240 
out G and if you really want to go kind
of<00:02:06.330> more<00:02:06.600> hardcore<00:02:07.170> debt<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.860> owe<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
of more hardcore debt you owe all that
