00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello to all welcome to this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.589
 second video that will speak 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.640
 of aquariophilie which I reassure you I 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.970
 do not want to say each time the same 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.859
 things 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.469
 for this second video we will talk 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 of garbage bins arioi why garbage cans to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 what a beautiful Ariane is a word 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.820
 invented a word suitcase that speaks of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 trash cans and aquariums I reassure you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 I did not put the fish to the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 trash but nowadays in any case 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.390
 it's a concept we've got a lot of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.529
 heard about these last years I 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.510
 explains to you the very principle 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.580
 just arioi bins I think 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 that I will make a specific video on 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 the orium garbage cans is the fact of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 maintain these fish in the summer 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.260
 outside and it's just a happiness 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 now it's still asking for a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.980
 minimum of mastery do not do it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 no matter how but most of the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.110
 time we take out the fish from 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 may june until september october at 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.469
 maximum after it is very variable according to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 species all species of 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 fish can not necessarily 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 go outside it also depends on 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.340
 the region you live in and in this video 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.680
 I will show you how I did 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.489
 to get them inside it's a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.350
 way of doing that is totally 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 personal I think there is not a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 way to get the fish back to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 inside me that's how I 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310
 process 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 you must know that I have two garbage cans 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.880
 that I shot you only one and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.990
 that it also allowed me to see what 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.250
 which was more convenient for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.200
 fish how to proceed 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.729
 in the video you will see they have 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.049
 been first put in a bucket and then 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.280
 acclimated to the bag 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.840
 after for the second news I 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 process directly putting them in the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.170
 transport rooms that allowed me to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.299
 to see that it was anyway more 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 convenient for them easier so in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.240
 this video I have a step 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.689
 extra that does not have them at all 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.579
 disturbs 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.159
 saw how they were two days longer 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.539
 late dream that there is no 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.069
 on it if you have questions 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.170
 do not hesitate and I find you just 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.969
 after the video I chose from you 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.679
 filming my number one trash for you 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.149
 show how I live them most 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.740
 important here was the seal of 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.090
 recovery for the fish I would have 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.259
 could place them directly in the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.549
 transport rooms to avoid them a 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.209
 additional fishing but everything 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.310
 very well 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:59.709
 that's the material I used two 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.709
 jumps of tupperware and a pitcher a pipe 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.550
 a landing net 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.850
 transport bags afterwards is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850
 a towel 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.660
 and let's get started right away 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.610
 at the jug paying attention to each 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 times because fish slips very 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.580
 easily 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.100
 here we have a galaxy that has crept 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.770
 in the pitcher of which this big valley in the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.240
 bucket of white color I did well 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.800
 be careful so you can spot them 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.960
 whenever there was one or more 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.580
 fish up in the white bucket the 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.350
 Tupperware served me to recover 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.850
 all plants 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.990
 So I have to rinse and the majority 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.990
 came back in aquariums 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.040
 I removed very gently the great 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 roots by avoiding stressing the fish 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.590
 so needs a good cleaning is a 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 good brushing 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.510
 and I continue with my office in 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.850
 ensuring each time doing well 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.710
 watch out if there are fish in it 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
 here for example a pretty bad pin 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.350
 crept in bronze so 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.730
 direction the white seal and I continue 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.040
 you have to know that I have recovered all 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.870
 introduced adults and a good 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.580
 baby quarantine 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.319
 I continue once the basin 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.000
 almost empty and I was roots and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.720
 very gently the plants that was 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.190
 very well encrusted in the ground and I 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.760
 picks up the net the last 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.280
 little recalcitrant and here are my little ones 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.810
 fish in the white bucket so I have 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.900
 finally decided to acclimatize them 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.670
 like in pet shop so I have them 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.019
 retrieved to put them in bags of 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.200
 transport which is much more 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.200
 convenient 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.060
 once in their bag I placed them 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.950
 few minutes in the aquarium for 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.870
 that the temperatures harmonize then 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.730
 I opened the bags and introduced 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.470
 delicately gradually from time to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.319
 time the equivalent of a glass of water from 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.790
 the aquarium in the bags and a moment 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.800
 given I opened the bags 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.330
 I left the fish decided the same 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.040
 when did they want to 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.450
 get into the aquarium so in the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.100
 trash there were state pins 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.650
 nitties and galaxies that you 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.180
 may present in two videos 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.950
 they are in perfect health they have 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.840
 resplendent colors a lot of 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.040
 reflections they were a little bit surprised 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.380
 change 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.850
 but soon they found their 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.210
 Summer neighborhoods delighted with power 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.890
 discover a new environment and I 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.370
 shows you right after the aquarium two 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.370
 days later 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.300
 and here is the corium an acclimatization 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.500
 really succeeded the year 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.500
 next who goes outside 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 this video did not hesitate you to the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.380
 league and comment to share it 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.030
 I'm going to warn you crazy about 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.860
 some links on the rubbish bins 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.180
 if you want to know more and very 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.340
 soon you will be able to discover 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.760
 tutorial videos from bda forum 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.760
 I look forward 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.460
 and in a next video of this will be 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.610
 a tutorial on cats or not no actually 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.610
 no
