teach<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.540> steps<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.500> found<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.830> this

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
teach it in steps and I found that this

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.650 
teach it in steps and I found that this
worked<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.400> me<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:12.150> gonna<00:00:12.269> work<00:00:12.389> for

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
worked for me and it's gonna work for

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.150 
worked for me and it's gonna work for
these<00:00:12.780> next<00:00:12.990> level<00:00:13.259> athletes<00:00:13.590> as<00:00:13.710> well<00:00:13.860> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
these next level athletes as well and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.250 
these next level athletes as well and
hopefully<00:00:14.519> yours<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:14.969> well<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.630> now<00:00:16.080> we're

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
hopefully yours as well so now we're

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.570 
hopefully yours as well so now we're
going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> teach<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> position<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.250> start<00:00:17.490> at

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
going to teach the position we start at

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
going to teach the position we start at
the<00:00:17.640> point<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.970> contact<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:19.170> we're<00:00:19.380> going<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the point of contact now we're going to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
the point of contact now we're going to
take<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> step<00:00:20.070> backwards<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
take a step backwards so now I'm a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
take a step backwards so now I'm a
little<00:00:22.320> farther<00:00:22.529> away<00:00:22.850> there's<00:00:23.850> two

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
little farther away there's two

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.320 
little farther away there's two
different<00:00:25.019> type<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> zones<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.150> play

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
different type of zones when we play

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.400 
different type of zones when we play
football<00:00:27.599> when<00:00:27.869> we're<00:00:27.960> trying<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> tackle

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
football when we're trying to tackle

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
football when we're trying to tackle
number<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.460> there's<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> speed<00:00:30.539> zone<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
number one there's a speed zone the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
number one there's a speed zone the
speed<00:00:31.830> zone<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.250> between<00:00:32.640> anywhere<00:00:33.030> where

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
speed zone is between anywhere where

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299 
speed zone is between anywhere where
you're<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.530> ball<00:00:34.739> carrier<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.219> about

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you're at and the ball carrier is about

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
you're at and the ball carrier is about
four<00:00:35.640> yards<00:00:35.850> away<00:00:36.120> from<00:00:36.510> wherever<00:00:37.350> you're<00:00:37.590> at

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
four yards away from wherever you're at

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.049 
four yards away from wherever you're at
to<00:00:38.070> where<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> ball<00:00:38.520> carrier<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.850> four

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to where the ball carrier that four

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
to where the ball carrier that four
yards<00:00:39.300> away<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.899> once<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.649> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
yards away now once you get into that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.590 
yards away now once you get into that
four<00:00:41.040> yards<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.489> call<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> timing<00:00:42.149> zone

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
four yards just call it the timing zone

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
four yards just call it the timing zone
okay<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> timing<00:00:44.250> zone<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:44.760> start

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
okay and that timing zone you guys start

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
okay and that timing zone you guys start
coming<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> balance<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.050> guys<00:00:46.170> start<00:00:46.379> getting

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
coming to balance you guys start getting

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
coming to balance you guys start getting
under<00:00:46.829> control<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> start<00:00:48.000> getting<00:00:48.059> his

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
under control so I start getting his

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
under control so I start getting his
feet<00:00:48.570> set<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.350> make<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> tackle<00:00:49.920> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
feet set so you can make a tackle with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
feet set so you can make a tackle with
consistency<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.570> effort<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.199> power

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
consistency with effort and with power

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
consistency with effort and with power
and<00:00:52.739> execution<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> next

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and execution so here we go the next

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.810 
and execution so here we go the next
step<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.469> progression<00:00:55.829> ready

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
step for this progression ready

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.170 
step for this progression ready
positioning<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> big<00:00:58.739> step<00:00:59.010> back<00:00:59.280> now

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
positioning now take a big step back now

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
positioning now take a big step back now
in<00:01:00.420> turn<00:01:00.570> taking<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> big<00:01:01.050> step<00:01:01.289> back<00:01:01.469> now

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in turn taking a big step back now

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
in turn taking a big step back now

to run to the ball carrier I don't want

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
to run to the ball carrier I don't want
to<00:01:06.900> shuffle<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.580> feet<00:01:08.970> and

guy so when we do this position here and

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.349 
guy so when we do this position here and
I<00:02:35.959> hit<00:02:36.109> through<00:02:36.409> them<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:37.189> I<00:02:37.220> can<00:02:37.730> release<00:02:38.030> all

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359

the<00:02:38.599> power<00:02:38.840> through<00:02:39.799> him<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:41.329> through

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the power through him and go through

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.449 
the power through him and go through
them<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.840> way<00:02:41.989> if<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.500> get<00:02:42.560> two<00:02:42.920> head<00:02:43.099> up

them that way if I get two head up
it<00:02:43.730> defeats<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> purpose<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.750> how<00:02:44.840> much<00:02:44.989> speed

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it defeats the purpose of how much speed

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.500 
it defeats the purpose of how much speed
I<00:02:45.260> have
