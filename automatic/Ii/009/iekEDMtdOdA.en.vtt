 of use in this country greetings and good 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 nights there are many types of harness but 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.950
 those that we commonly know those that 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.540
 are for sale are the vehicles 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.310
 unmanned aerial but I love you 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.500
 tell that there is already regulation in Mexico 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.510
 since April we are going to talk only about the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 drones that people can use because 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.599
 there are many types of drones what does not 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.700
 you must do with any type of drones 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.590
 it's obviously throwing objects while 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.650
 is flying because you can hurt 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.690
 a person can not transport 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.760
 illicit or dangerous merchandise 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.040
 you do not believe can not be used for 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720
 night unless they have permission you are 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.010
 responsible for the drone anything that 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.390
 pass someone with the drone 3 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.489
 responsible if they have a drone in 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.620
 house we can not give more than 122 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.170
 meters high and can not go anymore 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.819
 fast 55 kilometers per hour and per 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 example if I want to use it in festivals 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.780
 in concerts at a picnic if you're 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.000
 allowed as long as it's 46 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.950
 meters in height of people and can 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.599
 fly drones near airports 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.150
 but as long as it's in a 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.319
 minimum distance of 9.2 kilometers as well 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.180
 if they have a drone 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.920
 well you know not only with all the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.469
 responsibility of the world because 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.280
 it must be this week these came out 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:14.540
 two phones the sony xperia m4a quad and 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.540
 the third generation voltage 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.699
 It has similar characteristics as 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.310
 5 inch camera 3 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.229
 megapixels use lollipop their price 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.290
 It ranges between three thousand and four thousand pesos 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.240
 and they're also submersible to water so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.660
 tell us which one you would buy or what is the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.660
 what do you like more 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.110
 is what happens to them after many 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.390
 years of working on this if you like the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.150
 story like me and they like to be 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.000
 digging videos and materials in 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.950
 internet / obviously youtube is a 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.810
 good news because ap and the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.140
 organization british movie town 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.660
 joined to digitize 550 thousand videos 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.310
 on youtube and it was super interesting 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.290
 because they can watch videos from marilyn 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.360
 monroe with that case with the baseball player 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.830
 joe dimaggio that with that goal 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.150
 divorced where they got married I think in 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.860
 March and they divorced in October of 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.390
 good year but I think manny had 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.010
 an affair with the president that I believe 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.800
 that was much more fun can 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.050
 find videos since 1895 that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.160
 what they are gradually raising 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.050
 You can also watch videos for example from 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.210
 the viruses when they first arrived 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.710
 time to new york in usa keys that 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.480
 You can find information on everything 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.760
 want obviously related to the 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.370
 united kingdom and history you find it 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.480
 in www.youtube.com file and good here 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.480
 down can appear the digital 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.970
 since today 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 also wrote Jorge Miguel and says what 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.920
 you think about the new terminals 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.110
 Motorola and its kisses specifications 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.300
 Well, head engine captures 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.700
 new smartphones is the engine x play 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.010
 moto x style and the third g vote 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.270
 generation in my opinion the phones 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.860
 smart 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.450
 Most different brands have 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.940
 features or specifications 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.430
 similar techniques but in the case of 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.990
 Motorola is different because it has this 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.240
 option to personalize phone 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.670
 smart with motor maker and in my 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.250
 opinion the price and benefit is good 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.750
 besides having pure android is fine 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.460
 of the week if they do not know what to do 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.980
 I recommend that you go see mission 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.010
 impossible secret nation all micros 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.240
 technology action suspense you know what 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.100
 typical that there are in this type of movies 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.660
 and I also want to recommend that you 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.460
 go to eat ice cream at a place that 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.020
 called milk whiskers are great 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.940
 in Mexico City 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.680

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.880

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.849
 I did not ask if you loved me 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.969
 I think I do not understand you 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:51.289

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.289
