objects when you come down out of this
tower<00:00:17.789> room<00:00:18.210> there<00:00:18.779> will<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.730> rockets

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
tower room there will be some rockets

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
tower room there will be some rockets
to<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.420> right<00:00:21.960> almost<00:00:22.560> where<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:22.830> standing

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
to your right almost where I'm standing

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.870 
to your right almost where I'm standing
right<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:24.470> make<00:00:25.470> sure<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.769> pick<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.070> up

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.040 

because<00:00:29.880> you've<00:00:30.119> only<00:00:30.179> got<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.449> shot<00:00:30.840> with

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
because you've only got one shot with

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
because you've only got one shot with
the<00:00:31.140> rocket<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.610> soon<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> out

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the rocket and I as soon as I got it out

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
the rocket and I as soon as I got it out
I<00:00:33.270> realized<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.500> right

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I realized that so there they are right

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.270 
I realized that so there they are right
there<00:00:35.719> that<00:00:36.719> gives<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.440> shots<00:00:37.770> total

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
there that gives you four shots total

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
there that gives you four shots total
and<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.750> you'd<00:00:39.930> use<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.500> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and you can if you'd use them right you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
and you can if you'd use them right you
can<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.640> everybody<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can actually get everybody in the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.069 
can actually get everybody in the
courtyard<00:00:43.040> with<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.250> shots<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.840> soon<00:00:46.020> as

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
courtyard with your shots so as soon as

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
courtyard with your shots so as soon as
you<00:00:46.200> cross<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> threshold<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.700> by<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you cross that threshold and go by that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
you cross that threshold and go by that
car<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.899> come<00:00:49.140> running<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
car they come running out of the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
car they come running out of the
machine-gun<00:00:50.219> nest<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> first<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
machine-gun nest there so first is a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.709 
machine-gun nest there so first is a
wave<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.309> regular<00:00:53.640> soldiers<00:00:54.120> maybe<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
wave of just regular soldiers maybe a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.709 
wave of just regular soldiers maybe a
shotgun<00:00:54.989> guy<00:00:55.789> let<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> front

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
shotgun guy let them get to the front

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.799 
shotgun guy let them get to the front
and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.410> them<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.940> didn't

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and then take them out I actually didn't

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.120 
and then take them out I actually didn't
mean<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.260> guy<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.920> close

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
mean for that guy to get so close

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.460 
mean for that guy to get so close
so<00:01:05.130> fortunately<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.810> able<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> good

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
so fortunately I was able to get a good

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.630 
so fortunately I was able to get a good
shot<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:08.070> him<00:01:09.020> as<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.160> see<00:01:11.310> they<00:01:11.460> kind

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
shot off on him as you can see they kind

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
shot off on him as you can see they kind
of<00:01:11.700> run<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.530> both

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of run and then they they go out both

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.960 
of run and then they they go out both
sides<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.250> nest<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.580> then<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.790> come

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
sides of the nest but then they come

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.100 
sides of the nest but then they come
back<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.390> front<00:01:15.600> there

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
back to the front there

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.040 
back to the front there
so<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.310> Rockies<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.030> them<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.240 

guess<00:01:22.050> I<00:01:22.170> didn't<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.440> as<00:01:22.590> lucky<00:01:22.800> as<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.130> had

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
guess I didn't get as lucky as I had

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.690 
guess I didn't get as lucky as I had
hoped<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:24.270> machine<00:01:24.750> gun<00:01:24.900> guys<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.440> a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
hoped with the machine gun guys but a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.460 
hoped with the machine gun guys but a
couple<00:01:26.700> rounds<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> face<00:01:28.040> takes<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.160> out

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
couple rounds to the face takes him out

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
couple rounds to the face takes him out
now<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.800> come<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> shield<00:01:32.310> guys<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.870> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
now here come the shield guys so use a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.880 
now here come the shield guys so use a
rocket<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.380> them<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.900> need<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
rocket on them you need to use it the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
rocket on them you need to use it the
grenade<00:01:41.190> trick<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:46.920> should<00:01:47.070> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
grenade trick and then there should be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.469 
grenade trick and then there should be
one<00:01:47.190> more<00:01:47.430> group<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.780> last<00:01:48.960> rocket

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
one more group so use your last rocket

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.180 
one more group so use your last rocket
and<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> right<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.830> hit<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
and if you do it right and you hit that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.190 
and if you do it right and you hit that
nest<00:01:53.550> as<00:01:53.850> they're<00:01:54.180> coming<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.960> should<00:01:55.170> be

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
nest as they're coming out you should be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100 
nest as they're coming out you should be
able<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.440> get<00:01:55.650> them<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.690> looks<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.960> was

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
able to get them but looks like I was

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.730 
able to get them but looks like I was
off<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.530> bit

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
grenades are only really effective if

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the left let's take them out and then

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000 
the left let's take them out and then
head<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.010> downstairs<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:34.110> gonna<00:02:34.680> go<00:02:34.860> get

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
head back downstairs so I'm gonna go get

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.949 
head back downstairs so I'm gonna go get
some<00:02:35.250> more<00:02:35.400> health<00:02:41.270> if<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.360> wanted<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> you

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
some more health if you wanted to you

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.040 
some more health if you wanted to you
could<00:02:43.050> pick<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.380> magnum<00:02:43.830> right<00:02:44.730> there

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
could pick up a magnum right there

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.350 
could pick up a magnum right there
though<00:02:46.050> shield<00:02:46.350> guys<00:02:46.500> drop<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:48.120> probably

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
though shield guys drop it it's probably

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940 
though shield guys drop it it's probably
a<00:02:48.420> good<00:02:48.510> idea<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.870> pick<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.140> another<00:02:49.440> secondary

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
a good idea to pick up another secondary

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.600 
a good idea to pick up another secondary
weapon<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:52.170> amazingly<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.100> picked<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
weapon so amazingly I picked up the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.250 
weapon so amazingly I picked up the
mac-10<00:02:53.820> just<00:02:54.360> because<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.630> needed<00:02:55.050> something

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
mac-10 just because I needed something

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.610 
mac-10 just because I needed something
other<00:02:55.590> than<00:02:55.830> an<00:02:56.100> empty<00:02:56.360> RPG<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:01.290> before<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
other than an empty RPG that before you

other than an empty RPG that before you
come<00:03:01.770> down<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.100> once<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> come<00:03:02.670> down

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
come down because once you come down
