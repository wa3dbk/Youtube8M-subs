gigabytes a free space on your device
now<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:30.990> heads<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.560> you're

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
now just a little heads up you're

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.260 
now just a little heads up you're
probably<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> need<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.520> uses<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.120> your

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
probably going to need it uses on your

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.209 
probably going to need it uses on your
internal<00:00:33.690> storage<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.680> because<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.130> you're

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
internal storage just because if you're

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.590 
internal storage just because if you're
using<00:00:35.340> our<00:00:35.520> ste<00:00:35.700> card<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> most<00:00:36.450> likely

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
using our ste card is most likely

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020 
using our ste card is most likely
formatted<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.290> fat32<00:00:37.770> nets<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.730> may<00:00:38.850> know

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
formatted as fat32 nets you may know

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
formatted as fat32 nets you may know
fat32<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.050> hold<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> file<00:00:40.590> larger<00:00:41.040> than

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
fat32 can that hold the file larger than

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
fat32 can that hold the file larger than
4<00:00:41.399> gigabyte<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> 5<00:00:42.420> gigabyte<00:00:42.840> file

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
4 gigabyte and this is a 5 gigabyte file

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
4 gigabyte and this is a 5 gigabyte file
so<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:44.070> prepared<00:00:44.190> user<00:00:44.610> internal<00:00:45.000> storage<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so be prepared user internal storage and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
so be prepared user internal storage and
that's<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:46.739> much<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.250> let's<00:00:48.180> get

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that's pretty much it so let's get

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:03.570 
that's pretty much it so let's get
started

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580

the arm version of backpack five so go

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.560 
the arm version of backpack five so go
diversion<00:01:08.590> backtrack<00:01:09.590> 5<00:01:09.830> make<00:01:10.820> sure<00:01:11.030> arm<00:01:11.330> is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
diversion backtrack 5 make sure arm is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.560 
diversion backtrack 5 make sure arm is
lected<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.159> image<00:01:13.159> type<00:01:13.549> is<00:01:13.790> selected<00:01:13.939> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
lected and image type is selected and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.130 
lected and image type is selected and
just<00:01:15.560> sit<00:01:15.710> down

so now what we're going to do is using
7-zip<00:01:23.670> extract<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.299> file<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.929> go<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
7-zip extract the file so go down to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.429 
7-zip extract the file so go down to
extract<00:01:25.710> files<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.780> track<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
extract files and it will track them and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
extract files and it will track them and
if<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.429> 7-zip<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.119> check<00:01:30.299> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
if you don't have 7-zip just check in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.639 
if you don't have 7-zip just check in
the<00:01:30.479> description<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:31.020> I'll<00:01:31.170> provide<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.619> a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
to do is boot up backtrack 5 so on the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.700 
to do is boot up backtrack 5 so on the
device<00:03:06.320> open<00:03:06.770> up<00:03:06.890> terminal<00:03:07.130> emulator

your B and C so let's now go into
Android<00:05:43.600> VNC<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.290> look<00:05:45.130> at<00:05:45.280> this

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
Android VNC and look at this

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.680 
Android VNC and look at this
so<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.470> launched<00:05:47.710> Android<00:05:48.040> VNC<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:49.270> Android

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
so the launched Android VNC so Android

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.190 
so the launched Android VNC so Android
VNC<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.170> can<00:05:50.320> have<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:50.650> nickname<00:05:51.160> password

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
VNC you can have to nickname password

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.260 
VNC you can have to nickname password
address<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.380> port<00:05:53.700> now<00:05:54.700> for<00:05:55.000> your<00:05:55.090> password

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
address and port now for your password

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.450 
address and port now for your password
is<00:05:55.570> typing<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.960> password<00:05:55.990> your<00:05:56.830> port<00:05:57.160> number

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
is typing a password your port number

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.710 
is typing a password your port number
that's<00:05:57.790> gonna<00:05:57.970> be<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.090> most<00:05:58.210> tricky<00:05:58.420> thing

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
that's gonna be the most tricky thing

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.780 
that's gonna be the most tricky thing
you<00:05:58.870> have<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.110> do<00:05:59.230> here<00:05:59.470> because<00:05:59.710> the<00:06:00.460> port

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
you have to do here because the port

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.370 
you have to do here because the port
should<00:06:01.270> be<00:06:01.420> 5901<00:06:02.760> however<00:06:03.760> I'm<00:06:04.300> finding<00:06:05.140> each

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
should be 5901 however I'm finding each

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.750 
should be 5901 however I'm finding each
time<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:06.130> different

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
time it's different

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.820 
time it's different
so<00:06:07.120> if<00:06:07.270> you<00:06:07.360> try<00:06:07.510> to<00:06:07.540> do<00:06:07.750> 901<00:06:08.290> and<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.620> get<00:06:08.800> a

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
so if you try to do 901 and you get a

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.480 
so if you try to do 901 and you get a
connection<00:06:09.370> error<00:06:09.550> try<00:06:10.000> 5902<00:06:10.750> 15<00:06:11.710> idol<00:06:12.010> 3<00:06:12.310> and

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
connection error try 5902 15 idol 3 and

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.360 
connection error try 5902 15 idol 3 and
so<00:06:12.670> on<00:06:12.700> for<00:06:13.510> me<00:06:13.660> it's<00:06:13.960> good<00:06:14.170> 903<00:06:14.800> originally<00:06:15.310> I

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
so on for me it's good 903 originally I

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.480 
so on for me it's good 903 originally I
did<00:06:15.520> this<00:06:15.640> it<00:06:15.850> was<00:06:15.940> 5902<00:06:16.480> and<00:06:16.980> 5901<00:06:17.980> just<00:06:18.340> never

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
did this it was 5902 and 5901 just never

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.610 
did this it was 5902 and 5901 just never
worked<00:06:18.670> for<00:06:18.850> me<00:06:18.970> so<00:06:19.540> that's<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.140> only<00:06:20.380> thing<00:06:20.530> I

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
worked for me so that's the only thing I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.410 
worked for me so that's the only thing I
can<00:06:20.800> suggest<00:06:20.920> when<00:06:21.310> it<00:06:21.400> comes<00:06:21.550> to<00:06:21.820> port<00:06:22.210> I<00:06:22.330> know

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
can suggest when it comes to port I know

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.600 
can suggest when it comes to port I know
there's<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.750> file<00:06:22.960> which<00:06:23.230> you<00:06:23.260> can<00:06:23.470> look<00:06:23.620> at<00:06:23.830> um

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
there's a file which you can look at um

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.400 
there's a file which you can look at um
and<00:06:24.880> kind<00:06:25.390> of<00:06:25.480> see<00:06:25.660> what<00:06:25.870> port<00:06:26.080> number<00:06:26.290> it<00:06:26.380> is

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
and kind of see what port number it is

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.440 
and kind of see what port number it is
but<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:26.830> just<00:06:27.130> say<00:06:27.220> hey<00:06:27.490> just<00:06:27.670> start<00:06:28.060> guessing

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
but I just say hey just start guessing

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.420 
but I just say hey just start guessing
when<00:06:28.660> I<00:06:28.750> know<00:06:28.810> one<00:06:29.110> to<00:06:29.230> keep<00:06:29.380> on<00:06:29.500> up<00:06:29.680> up<00:06:29.800> up<00:06:30.010> and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
when I know one to keep on up up up and

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.420 
when I know one to keep on up up up and
make<00:06:30.970> sure<00:06:31.060> your<00:06:31.210> bit<00:06:31.360> is<00:06:31.390> at<00:06:31.660> 24<00:06:32.110> bit<00:06:32.380> for<00:06:33.100> bpp

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
make sure your bit is at 24 bit for bpp

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.330 
make sure your bit is at 24 bit for bpp
and<00:06:34.230> that's<00:06:35.230> pretty<00:06:35.410> much<00:06:35.500> it<00:06:35.680> so<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:36.040> connects

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
and that's pretty much it so it connects

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.040 
and that's pretty much it so it connects
and<00:06:39.340> this<00:06:39.610> one<00:06:39.760> connect<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:40.210> well<00:06:40.480> there<00:06:40.840> we

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
and this one connect and well there we

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.530 
and this one connect and well there we
are<00:06:41.080> we<00:06:41.500> are<00:06:41.530> in<00:06:41.920> backtrack<00:06:42.580> 5<00:06:42.820> right<00:06:43.270> there

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
are we are in backtrack 5 right there

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.470 
are we are in backtrack 5 right there
and<00:06:45.150> I<00:06:46.150> mean<00:06:46.390> it's<00:06:46.570> pretty<00:06:46.840> smooth<00:06:48.360> just<00:06:49.360> like

use<00:07:06.270> this<00:07:06.360> to<00:07:06.420> crack<00:07:06.630> WEP<00:07:07.040> the<00:07:08.040> short<00:07:08.310> answer

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
use this to crack WEP the short answer

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.270 
use this to crack WEP the short answer
is<00:07:08.670> no<00:07:09.090> because<00:07:10.020> of<00:07:10.710> the<00:07:10.800> driver<00:07:11.040> issue

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
is no because of the driver issue

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.730 
is no because of the driver issue
however<00:07:12.180> I<00:07:12.450> was<00:07:12.690> reading<00:07:12.900> on<00:07:12.960> some<00:07:13.110> forums<00:07:13.410> and

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
however I was reading on some forums and

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.600 
however I was reading on some forums and
apparently<00:07:14.280> if<00:07:14.580> you<00:07:14.790> did<00:07:15.150> connect<00:07:15.600> external

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
apparently if you did connect external

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.070 
apparently if you did connect external
you<00:07:17.610> know<00:07:17.730> we<00:07:17.880> call<00:07:18.030> a<00:07:18.060> water<00:07:18.360> sedap<00:07:18.720> turn<00:07:18.900> s

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
you know we call a water sedap turn s

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.390 
you know we call a water sedap turn s
