they'll be on one of the other courses

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
they'll be on one of the other courses
probably<00:01:51.300> North<00:01:51.480> or<00:01:51.660> South<00:01:51.690> Korea<00:01:52.080> having<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
probably North or South Korea having it

probably North or South Korea having it
divided<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:54.120> anticipating<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
divided we're anticipating that the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.800 
divided we're anticipating that the
division<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.730> place<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.330> this<00:01:57.540> clearing

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
division to take place in this clearing

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
division to take place in this clearing
area<00:01:58.260> here<00:01:58.729> cutting<00:01:59.729> down<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.690> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
area here cutting down you know and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.240 
area here cutting down you know and
around<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.290> through<00:02:01.500> these<00:02:01.920> new<00:02:02.130> efficiency

around and through these new efficiency

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.880 
around and through these new efficiency
to<00:02:02.940> cut<00:02:03.120> through<00:02:03.650> somewhere<00:02:04.650> in<00:02:04.770> this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
to cut through somewhere in this

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.350 
to cut through somewhere in this
vicinity<00:02:05.070> yeah<00:02:05.729> right

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
vicinity yeah right

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
vicinity yeah right
we<00:02:06.479> haven't<00:02:06.720> said<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.470> from<00:02:08.070> where<00:02:08.280> we

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
we haven't said it it's from where we

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.770 
we haven't said it it's from where we
are<00:02:08.700> up<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.240> where<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.600> Bush<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.420> because

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
are up to where this Bush is but because

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.040 
are up to where this Bush is but because
it<00:02:13.230> drops<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.860> nicely<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.730> because<00:02:15.240> big

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
it drops so nicely and because big

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.810 
it drops so nicely and because big

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
from right down here because goes down

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.060 
from right down here because goes down
it<00:05:03.910> makes<00:05:04.120> this<00:05:04.270> comes<00:05:05.199> down<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.770> you

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
it makes this comes down and this you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.810 
it makes this comes down and this you
and<00:05:06.340> then<00:05:06.460> comes<00:05:06.699> back<00:05:06.789> around

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.399

this place is huge

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.850 
this place is huge
it<00:05:16.149> was<00:05:17.149> a<00:05:17.179> lack<00:05:17.449> time<00:05:17.659> here<00:05:18.019> Indian<00:05:18.589> River<00:05:18.830> I
