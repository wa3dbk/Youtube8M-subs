rebuffing<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:02.229> think<00:01:03.229> I've<00:01:03.350> been<00:01:03.470> using<00:01:03.649> that

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
rebuffing I think I've been using that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.340 
rebuffing I think I've been using that
buff<00:01:04.369> friction<00:01:05.300> polish<00:01:05.509> I<00:01:05.899> better<00:01:06.110> get<00:01:06.290> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
buff friction polish I better get a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
buff friction polish I better get a
clean<00:01:06.649> line

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.749 

that's<00:01:18.670> still<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.090> Reverse<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:21.460> why<00:01:21.700> it

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
that's still in Reverse that's why it

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.490 
that's still in Reverse that's why it
doesn't<00:01:22.270> start<00:01:22.450> right<00:01:22.659> away<00:01:22.840> when<00:01:23.200> it's<00:01:23.350> in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
doesn't start right away when it's in

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.569 
doesn't start right away when it's in
Reverse<00:01:25.649> just<00:01:26.649> in<00:01:26.799> case<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.189> change<00:01:27.490> your

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
Reverse just in case you change your

00:01:27.579 --> 00:02:00.969 
Reverse just in case you change your
mind

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.170 

okay<00:02:03.860> now<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> there

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
okay now I have to get that out of there

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.830 
okay now I have to get that out of there
okay<00:02:10.190> now<00:02:11.190> there's<00:02:11.430> only<00:02:11.580> glue<00:02:12.000> around<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
okay now there's only glue around the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.839 
okay now there's only glue around the
outside<00:02:13.230> rim<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.300> part<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.849> on

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
outside rim so if I part in on that on

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.070 
outside rim so if I part in on that on
the<00:02:18.540> waste<00:02:18.810> block<00:02:20.180> I'll<00:02:21.180> only<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.810> part

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the waste block I'll only have to part

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
the waste block I'll only have to part
in<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.530> half<00:02:22.800> an<00:02:22.920> inch<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.580> should<00:02:23.849> be

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
in about half an inch and that should be

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.479 
in about half an inch and that should be
loose<00:02:26.660> unfortunately<00:02:27.799> it's<00:02:28.799> going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.340> on

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
loose unfortunately it's going to be on

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.070 
loose unfortunately it's going to be on
the<00:02:29.610> wrong<00:02:29.760> side<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.510> won't<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.870> able<00:02:30.959> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the wrong side and you won't be able to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.720 
the wrong side and you won't be able to
see<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:33.290> don't<00:02:34.290> think<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:35.100> need<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.459> light

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
see it I don't think I need that light

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.610 
see it I don't think I need that light
on<00:02:35.760> there<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.390> might<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.110> right<00:02:37.380> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
on there now I might want this right on

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:50.720 
on there now I might want this right on
over<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.250> though<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:49.040> that's<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> road

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
over here though and that's in the road

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
over here though and that's in the road

you know get my 32 and I'll just part in

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.190 
you know get my 32 and I'll just part in
on<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.900> waste<00:03:10.140> side<00:03:11.000> waste<00:03:12.000> block<00:03:12.330> side<00:03:12.810> of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
on the waste side waste block side of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.370 
on the waste side waste block side of
the<00:03:13.770> glue<00:03:13.950> joint<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:17.720> I'll<00:03:18.720> maybe<00:03:18.900> slow<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
the glue joint and I'll maybe slow that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.970 
the glue joint and I'll maybe slow that
down<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:21.110> 800<00:03:22.110> again<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:23.210> don't<00:03:24.210> want<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.740> if<00:03:25.740> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
down to 800 again I don't want it if it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.880 
down to 800 again I don't want it if it
does<00:03:26.160> come<00:03:26.400> loose<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.940> don't<00:03:27.150> want<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.890> spinning

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
does come loose I don't want it spinning

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:49.620 
does come loose I don't want it spinning
too<00:03:29.070> fast

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:05:16.730 

I'm<00:03:50.630> sure<00:03:51.020> why<00:03:51.230> that's<00:03:52.990> sick

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:32.520 

okay<00:05:27.630> okay<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.870> wish<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:30.280> could<00:05:30.460> see<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:31.530> I've

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
okay okay I wish you could see that I've

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.890 
okay okay I wish you could see that I've
parted<00:05:33.010> in<00:05:33.220> and<00:05:35.460> I'm<00:05:36.460> close<00:05:37.180> enough<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.750> that

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
parted in and I'm close enough to that

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.560 
parted in and I'm close enough to that
recess<00:05:38.470> that<00:05:38.770> I<00:05:38.919> cut<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.820> face<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.389> the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
recess that I cut in the face of the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.210 
recess that I cut in the face of the
block<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:42.610> can<00:05:42.760> actually<00:05:43.979> sum<00:05:44.979> up<00:05:45.100> the

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
block that it can actually sum up the

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.830 
block that it can actually sum up the
wood<00:05:45.370> has<00:05:45.550> chipped<00:05:45.820> away<00:05:45.910> and<00:05:46.180> I<00:05:46.330> can<00:05:46.510> see<00:05:46.690> the

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
wood has chipped away and I can see the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.500 
wood has chipped away and I can see the
gap<00:05:47.490> underneath<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.850> tent<00:05:49.090> at<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.300> balls

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
gap underneath the tent at the balls

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.450 
gap underneath the tent at the balls
tenon<00:05:50.699> so<00:05:51.810> I've<00:05:52.810> only<00:05:53.020> got<00:05:53.229> about<00:05:53.350> 1/32<00:05:54.220> of<00:05:54.310> an

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
tenon so I've only got about 1/32 of an

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.600 
tenon so I've only got about 1/32 of an
inch<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:55.180> wood<00:05:56.100> in<00:05:57.100> about<00:05:57.520> 2/3<00:05:58.270> of<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:59.610> there's

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
inch of wood in about 2/3 of the there's

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.920 
inch of wood in about 2/3 of the there's
a<00:06:00.669> hole<00:06:00.940> there<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.289> hole<00:06:02.440> over<00:06:02.740> here<00:06:06.930> so

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
a hole there and a hole over here so

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.170 
a hole there and a hole over here so
I'll<00:06:08.110> just<00:06:08.320> give<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:08.740> a<00:06:08.770> wrap<00:06:09.010> and<00:06:09.729> it<00:06:09.970> should

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
I'll just give that a wrap and it should

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.379 
I'll just give that a wrap and it should
come<00:06:10.360> right<00:06:10.510> off<00:06:11.460> see<00:06:12.460> them<00:06:12.729> as<00:06:12.850> a<00:06:12.880> hole<00:06:13.120> there

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
come right off see them as a hole there

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.520 
come right off see them as a hole there
and<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.810> hole<00:06:13.960> here<00:06:14.850> this<00:06:15.850> little<00:06:16.270> web<00:06:16.510> here<00:06:17.260> and

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
and a hole here this little web here and

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.990 
and a hole here this little web here and
that<00:06:17.650> little<00:06:17.800> web<00:06:18.100> there<00:06:18.400> it<00:06:18.580> was<00:06:18.699> all<00:06:18.850> that

that little web there it was all that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.860 
that little web there it was all that
was<00:06:19.120> still<00:06:19.360> holding<00:06:19.539> that<00:06:19.720> on<00:06:21.479> so<00:06:22.479> that<00:06:22.660> came

was still holding that on so that came
off<00:06:23.020> pretty<00:06:23.320> good<00:06:24.990> I'll<00:06:25.990> just<00:06:26.289> round<00:06:26.560> the

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
off pretty good I'll just round the

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.180
