thing<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.579> talk<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.239> these<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.379> white

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
thing the talk on these the white

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.819 
thing the talk on these the white
infrareds<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.810> these<00:02:37.989> are<00:02:38.049> way<00:02:38.500> better

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
infrareds I think these are way better

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.280 
infrareds I think these are way better
than<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.549> ones<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.000> were<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.360> released<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
than the ones that were just released I

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.039 
than the ones that were just released I
think<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:41.799> leather<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.400> way<00:02:42.970> too<00:02:43.030> soft<00:02:43.599> I

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
think that leather is way too soft I

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.869 
think that leather is way too soft I
mean<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.560> haven't<00:02:44.739> bought<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.069> pair<00:02:45.370> yet<00:02:45.610> I

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
mean I haven't bought a pair yet I

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.660 
mean I haven't bought a pair yet I
didn't<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.510> really<00:02:46.840> run<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.470> I'll<00:02:48.430> get

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
didn't like really run on that I'll get

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.089 
didn't like really run on that I'll get
it<00:02:48.790> down<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.060> line<00:02:49.209> probably<00:02:49.480> but<00:02:50.019> i<00:02:50.290> think

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
it down the line probably but i think

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.819 
it down the line probably but i think
this<00:02:51.489> leather<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.450> material<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.049> way

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
this leather and the material is way

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.530 
this leather and the material is way
better<00:02:54.099> than<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.700> ones<00:02:54.879> that<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.269> came<00:02:55.510> out

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
better than the ones that just came out

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.599 
better than the ones that just came out
a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.170> better<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.769> as<00:02:57.760> far<00:02:58.090> as<00:02:58.150> these<00:02:59.609> there's

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
a lot better and as far as these there's

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.839 
a lot better and as far as these there's
a<00:03:00.700> lot<00:03:00.879> of<00:03:00.910> similarities<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:03.489> know<00:03:03.609> i

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
a lot of similarities and you know i

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.080 
a lot of similarities and you know i
mean<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.359> does<00:03:04.750> look<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.109> whole<00:03:05.319> lot<00:03:05.380> better<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
mean it does look a whole lot better the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170 
mean it does look a whole lot better the
infrared<00:03:07.630> looks<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.019> whole<00:03:08.200> lot<00:03:08.260> cleaner<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
infrared looks a whole lot cleaner and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.500 
infrared looks a whole lot cleaner and
the<00:03:10.450> varsity<00:03:10.959> red<00:03:11.200> but<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:13.120> me<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.359> pretty

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the varsity red but to me it's pretty

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.259 
the varsity red but to me it's pretty
much<00:03:13.630> almost<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.169> exact<00:03:14.380> same<00:03:14.410> thing<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:16.090> I

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
much almost the exact same thing but I

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.670 
much almost the exact same thing but I
still<00:03:16.540> think<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.870> kind<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.139> like<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.470> one

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
still think I kind of like this one

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.390 
still think I kind of like this one
better<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.480> red<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
better I like that red I just like the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.860 
better I like that red I just like the
color<00:03:21.579> pretty<00:03:21.910> much<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:24.010> these<00:03:24.400> are<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
color pretty much so these are the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.699 
color pretty much so these are the
things<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.019> comes<00:03:26.319> in

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.540
