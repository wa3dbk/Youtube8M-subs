00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 that and that still brings wild today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.410
 discussed 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.809
 claudia neumann reports tired 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 disappointed and visibly drawn 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 dragged vitali klitschko in the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.509
 Cabin still pretty shocked 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.379
 about what happened shortly before in the ring 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.270
 Had happened 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 it was the third round as klitschko 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.039
 a blow of lennox lewis 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 had to plug in a so-called cut 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 suffered over the left eye and henceforth 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.580
 be treated in every ring break 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 had to hit him completely unexpectedly 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.360
 nevertheless , initiated by the ring doctor 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.360
 fight call after the sixth round 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.310
 Usually a doctor has to come by 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.800
 and say yes you are ready to move on 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.760
 so fight difficulties or yes 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.130
 nobody asked me 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 dr wallace responsible for the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.150
 health of the boxer was already 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.900
 for the second time in the corner and go 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.520
 kitsch cast condition check 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.650
 the reason for the demolition was that the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 He has hindered his vision 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.590
 had to move his head around strangely 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.120
 to look at me 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 so he could not himself 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.200
 So I had to defend him 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.509
 unfortunate and protect 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.729
 who irresponsible it remained 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:18.020
 controversial verdict, however, not for 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.549
 george foreman furniture from something like that 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.740
 I have never seen it bad 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.600
 was not only up but also from 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.710
 would approach the bone below 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.460
 probably stop earlier 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.069
 have to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.650
 but apart from that klitschko is for 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.770
 me the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.630
 lying forward and he would have that too 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.640
 But finding a cut can do that 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 everything broken 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 the first hint of a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.610
 forbidden head butt as 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.530
 injury cause could lewis 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:58.480
 subsequently in the press conference 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:02:01.330
 his own kind of head butt vocabulary 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.800
 out you are crazy and yet 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.510
 thanks to lennox lewis 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.610
 title defense probably the early one 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.860
 abort because klitschko was until then the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.840
 stronger boxers tactical and also 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 not just the punctors 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.780
 values 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.150
 the ukraine in the lead but sometimes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 with a fighter to the winner explains the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 others but the whole event won 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.050
 as well as vitali today from 13,000 spectators 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.640
 leave all as klitschko 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.950
 it will only be a small consolation to him 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.349
 but the respect and admiration of the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.730
 Boxing fans in America had witali 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.010
 Klitschko with his courageous 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.010
 occurs impressively conquered
