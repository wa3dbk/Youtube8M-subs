00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.290 
field are basic but the middle infield
is<00:01:27.810> crucial<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:29.190> needs<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.550> be<00:01:29.730> really

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
gonna cover the base if there is a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
gonna cover the base if there is a
miscommunication<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.700> say<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.330> both<00:01:39.479> go

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
miscommunication and say they both go

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
miscommunication and say they both go
out<00:01:39.870> for<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.140> cut<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> good<00:01:41.010> base<00:01:41.280> runner<00:01:41.580> will

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
out for a cut a good base runner will

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
out for a cut a good base runner will
pick<00:01:41.910> up<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> possibly<00:01:42.900> take<00:01:43.260> second

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
pick up on that and possibly take second

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
pick up on that and possibly take second
so<00:01:43.860> remember<00:01:44.190> middle<00:01:44.790> infield<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.300> crucial

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so remember middle infield is crucial

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.290 
so remember middle infield is crucial
that<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.410> be<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.680> communication<00:01:47.430> thanks
