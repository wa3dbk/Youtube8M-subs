00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 because I know what happened 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 I can not define the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.059
 I am the color of your eyes that is that I am 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.439
 if you want a bigger space to get meat you are understanding 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.310
 no doubt about what I want 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.400
 I'm not uniformized or multiform 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.839
 So we should be prepared, he said. 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.060
 and there will be much more 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.259
 It will come an hour that you will see only the future. 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.439
 and you will feel my presence 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 what the toucan project 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.100
 in Colombia I explained that we did not come 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.510
 that you have or have no solution 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.850
 do you think they do not have a time when people do not have a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.379
 preference for trying to hit five ovens knew perfectly 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.859
 equate the people you like to attack 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.969
 Now you say something good. 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.859
 look at people the profile of people I like are arrogant people says 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.549
 they are materialistic people 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.860
 are individual people only people or price alias 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070
 the prejudiced 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.430
 You understand why my world is the law back. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310
 it's the law of the strongest 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.070
 is a personal friend 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.060
 and all the people who represent the state and society are people who 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.230
 not so good 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.900
 and if you know any of them you can tell me the address everything needs more 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.420
 the more the better that is missing the worker did not give more than you 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.920
 also on a single day here and thank god it's worth it 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.430
 It's too early at the box office. 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 even tried to balance the midfield and I liked it just when the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.499
 they serve these people because as the supporter has said ap ap ap ap ap 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:54.549
 as a matter of fact 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.130
 I think they are happy to start this I think they are better 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.369
 than us but in fact they are alike too 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.260
 because at that moment they assault leading people worse but actually 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.359
 the worst are what they get 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.579
 because people can use 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.499
 and that's why they cheer for me maybe they let me do the cleaning 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:19.709
 I must leave only the good on the face of the earth, but it does not really exist 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.769
 nobody is good nobody is normal people are normal and that is why 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.569
 they cheer for me because another normal person the good performance in the race 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.159
 night on the canon street 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.899
 so many characters and he practices 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.330
 the hole is being determined 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.350
 when you fail through your own identical deliberation 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.349
 coach 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.399
 appt ap ap ap ap ap 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.019
 this coexistence between each 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.769
 that this fact of israel that likes the forró 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.290
 this from time to time and if you take a cane 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.160
 and when there is more to collect more and santon but many times to give me 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.290
 some ideas tried to resist the action with doing something 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.239
 Bad and there it comes up. 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.879
 sophie 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.249
 and now it comes to talking about you 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.010
 In May, having a head also wins but we are forced to live with the 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:19.079
 that we are part of the same world, we are part of our imaginary and 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.489
 that's why we live it does not mean that we are and we live 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 in peace but simply live with each other 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:31.729
