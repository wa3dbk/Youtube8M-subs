all<00:00:01.829> right<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.280> little<00:00:02.639> update<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.120> the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
all right so a little update on the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.039 
all right so a little update on the
Impala<00:00:03.740> I<00:00:05.450> was<00:00:06.450> getting<00:00:07.250> the<00:00:08.250> oil<00:00:09.410> pressure

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
Impala I was getting the oil pressure

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.299 
Impala I was getting the oil pressure
low<00:00:13.049> oil<00:00:13.080> pressure<00:00:13.440> light<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.190> off

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
low oil pressure light was going off

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.120 
low oil pressure light was going off
kind<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> flickering<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.199> idle<00:00:16.500> so

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
kind of flickering on and off at idle so

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.060 
kind of flickering on and off at idle so
I<00:00:19.400> went<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.990> just<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I went and I just got you know the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
I went and I just got you know the
switch<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.640> thirty<00:00:23.939> boxing<00:00:24.449> special

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
switch there is thirty boxing special

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
switch there is thirty boxing special
order<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:25.859> autozone<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.730> went<00:00:26.880> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
order from autozone so I just went and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.310 
order from autozone so I just went and
got<00:00:29.269> cheapo<00:00:31.640> autozone<00:00:32.640> mechanical<00:00:33.390> pressure

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
got cheapo autozone mechanical pressure

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.049 
got cheapo autozone mechanical pressure
sender<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
sender and you see I got it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.660 
sender and you see I got it
plumbed<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.140> real<00:00:37.350> easy<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.309> hold

they're plumbed in down here down here
into<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.989> pressure<00:00:45.989> test<00:00:46.260> port<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
into the pressure test port which is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.479 
into the pressure test port which is
down<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.230> above<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> oil

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
down there it's right above the oil

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.049 
down there it's right above the oil
filter<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.910> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
filter so as you can see you know it's

cold start up and a cold start up I got
you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.699> pretty<00:00:56.969> good<00:00:57.059> oil<00:00:57.300> pressure<00:00:57.360> right

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you know pretty good oil pressure right

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.830 
you know pretty good oil pressure right
where<00:00:58.230> you'd<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
where you'd want to

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.250 
where you'd want to
you<00:00:59.080> know<00:00:59.200> 30<00:00:59.620> 38<00:01:00.220> 40<00:01:00.640> comic<00:01:01.000> reference<00:01:01.390> you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
you know 30 38 40 comic reference you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.630 
you know 30 38 40 comic reference you
read<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:03.430> know<00:01:03.610> jump<00:01:04.480> with

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.810 

it<00:01:08.630> jumps<00:01:09.020> with<00:01:09.490> our<00:01:10.490> PMS<00:01:10.790> there<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.670> I'll<00:01:13.670> let

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
it jumps with our PMS there but I'll let

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.060 
it jumps with our PMS there but I'll let
this<00:01:13.970> thing<00:01:14.210> heat<00:01:14.450> up<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.659> bit<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.080> then<00:01:15.950> I'll

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this thing heat up a bit and then I'll

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.590 
this thing heat up a bit and then I'll
show<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.280> what<00:01:16.400> sort<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.760> oil<00:01:16.940> pressure<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.330> run

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
show you what sort of oil pressure I run

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.160 
show you what sort of oil pressure I run
when<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:17.930> warm<00:01:22.510> all<00:01:23.510> right<00:01:23.660> so<00:01:23.869> we've<00:01:24.050> been

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
when it's warm all right so we've been

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.070 
when it's warm all right so we've been
idling<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.770> bit<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.580> see<00:01:29.080> oil

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
idling for a bit and you can see oil

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.010 
idling for a bit and you can see oil
pressures<00:01:30.590> steadily<00:01:31.430> drop<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.850> at<00:01:31.940> idle<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
pressures steadily drop it at idle and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.620 
pressures steadily drop it at idle and
as<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:33.920> heats<00:01:34.070> up<00:01:34.280> it'll<00:01:34.610> drop<00:01:34.790> right<00:01:34.850> down<00:01:35.090> to

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
as it heats up it'll drop right down to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.690 
as it heats up it'll drop right down to
sitting<00:01:36.530> basically<00:01:37.070> right<00:01:37.250> on<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.460> stop

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
sitting basically right on the stop

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.200 
sitting basically right on the stop
there

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
there

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.420 
there
0a<00:01:39.110> 0a<00:01:39.979> pressure<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.430> idle<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:42.310> looking<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
0a 0a pressure at idle so looking like a

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.210 
0a 0a pressure at idle so looking like a
new<00:01:43.640> motor

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.630 

also<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> other<00:01:47.150> thing<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.540> did<00:01:47.750> was<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:48.110> just

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
also the other thing I did was I just

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.520 
also the other thing I did was I just
you<00:01:49.640> know<00:01:49.670> shim<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
you know shim the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.680 
you know shim the
Parral<00:01:51.530> here<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.860> get<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.360> specific

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.620 

rpm<00:01:57.650> range<00:01:57.920> there<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:59.740> runs<00:02:00.740> like<00:02:00.800> crap<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.600> I

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
rpm range there and runs like crap so I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.190 
rpm range there and runs like crap so I
think<00:02:02.930> then<00:02:03.080> I'll<00:02:03.440> clean<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> injectors<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
think then I'll clean the injectors and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.880 
think then I'll clean the injectors and
should<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.260> able<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.440> do<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> couple

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
should be able to do that for a couple

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.710 
should be able to do that for a couple
bucks<00:02:07.220> 9-volt<00:02:08.030> battery<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> little

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
bucks 9-volt battery and a little

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.790 
bucks 9-volt battery and a little
circuit<00:02:09.410> there<00:02:09.640> but<00:02:11.080> give<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.290> shot

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
circuit there but give that a shot

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.310 
circuit there but give that a shot
oh<00:02:12.880> yeah<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.480> looking<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.930> weekend
