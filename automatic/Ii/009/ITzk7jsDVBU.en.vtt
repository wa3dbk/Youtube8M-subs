to make one of the other stats or
primary<00:00:36.719> stat<00:00:37.020> rather<00:00:37.290> than<00:00:37.500> crit<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.129> ahead

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
primary stat rather than crit go ahead

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100

and<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.360> would<00:00:39.510> mean<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> want

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and do so that would mean if you want

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350 
and do so that would mean if you want
mastery<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> primary<00:00:41.309> followed<00:00:41.910> by<00:00:42.030> crit

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
mastery as a primary followed by crit

mastery as a primary followed by crit
and<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.620> remember<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> will

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and so on just remember that this will

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069

I<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.650> experimenting<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.369> different

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I will be experimenting with different

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
I will be experimenting with different
stats<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> test<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.900> different<00:01:18.930> spec

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
stats as I test out different spec

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
stats as I test out different spec
builds<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.580> main<00:01:20.759> reason<00:01:21.030> behind<00:01:21.270> crib<00:01:21.780> as

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
builds but my main reason behind crib as

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
builds but my main reason behind crib as
a<00:01:22.320> primary<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> our<00:01:23.610> passive

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
a primary was because of our passive

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
a primary was because of our passive
ability<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.630> fewer<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.049> call<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> cruelty

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
ability and fewer you call the cruelty

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.130 
ability and fewer you call the cruelty
which<00:01:26.520> does<00:01:26.790> provide<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.240> five<00:01:27.420> percent<00:01:27.810> bonus

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
which does provide at five percent bonus

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
such a dilemma for example here is a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
such a dilemma for example here is a
piece<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.860> gear<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.370> obtained<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.000> couldn't

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
piece of gear that I obtained I couldn't

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360 
piece of gear that I obtained I couldn't
find<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.630> suitable<00:02:32.900> need<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.440> crit<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.739> mastery

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
find a suitable need of crit and mastery

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.190 
find a suitable need of crit and mastery
so<00:02:34.730> instead<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.150> look<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:35.930> has<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
so instead I look for one that has a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
so instead I look for one that has a
secondary<00:02:36.739> stat<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.069> wanted<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.790> enchanted<00:02:38.720> it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
secondary stat I wanted and enchanted it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.810 
secondary stat I wanted and enchanted it
with<00:02:38.900> my<00:02:39.020> primary<00:02:39.500> stat<00:02:39.830> since<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.340> enchanted

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
with my primary stat since the enchanted

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.910 
with my primary stat since the enchanted
stat<00:02:41.090> does<00:02:41.420> provide<00:02:41.750> far<00:02:42.140> more<00:02:42.380> than<00:02:42.440> any<00:02:42.709> of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
stat does provide far more than any of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.470 
stat does provide far more than any of
the<00:02:43.040> other<00:02:43.160> base<00:02:43.430> create<00:02:43.820> stats<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.300> other

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the other base create stats on the other

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.630 
the other base create stats on the other
gear<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.200> managed<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.590> get<00:02:45.739> both<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.130> primary

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
gear so I managed to get both my primary

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.729 
gear so I managed to get both my primary
and<00:02:46.760> secondary<00:02:46.850> stats<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.350> possible

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
and secondary stats and it is possible

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.990 
and secondary stats and it is possible
that<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.980> may<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.550> do<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.820> with<00:02:49.970> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
that you may have to do this with the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.790 
that you may have to do this with the
other<00:02:50.090> gear<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.750> can't<00:02:51.140> find<00:02:51.380> what<00:02:51.650> you're

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
other gear if you can't find what you're

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.080 
other gear if you can't find what you're
looking<00:02:52.070> for<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.519> there's<00:02:52.670> always

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090

options<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:54.170> mentioned<00:02:54.440> previously<00:02:54.620> this

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
options so as mentioned previously this
