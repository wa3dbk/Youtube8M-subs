00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.780
 game peace game gmbh a specialist with 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.059
 fight prices hey what is going on warmly 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.269
 Welcome here to a new episode like 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.570
 play against FC Chelsea 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.890
 for you it will be still russia 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.029
 a strong team 433 later that is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 probably comes very much poultry 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.849
 in the middle is where the war because 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 probably a bit like that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 flank in and I think too mega 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.239
 i suppose that will happen 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.980
 hard match for us 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.840
 I wanted to say that today 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 We really want to see a few gates 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.930
 he lets the ball lie and we 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.730
 just shake hands away shit 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.829
 says no, that was also still talked 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.949
 this is the upgrade i know it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.949
 Not 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.729
 inside is the thing minute aubameyang 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.130
 sunk the leather played by clean 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.869
 very good 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 my fingers are already like that again 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.619
 really crack 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.060
 very nice there is the farm has space 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.970
 and he has a great deal of things 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.490
 very good if you like the display 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.750
 supported please give it to you 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.270
 a thumbs up I try 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 all sorts of quality and also 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.020
 content to improve me 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 there were the fernschuss hvl again 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:59.110
 from me it turns out of the corner 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:01.960
 Mist corner bad that goes over it 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 okay okay we lead that is all 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 super offside 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.239
 pity that would have really good against 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 can have it now is it good now 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.280
 you perfect that it's off the wall and all that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.280
 continue 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.240
 a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 now he comes over the outside assad becomes one 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 last second stopped off with that 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.030
 pill away away throw sitcom yet 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.750
 yes ok throw in so fast 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:04.100
 horny thing beautiful volly deducted 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.290
 I think I pressed l2 or lt 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.080
 I thought it would be a bicycle I have 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.410
 no idea it looks at grandma wally 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.150
 knows what a goal is untenable 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.040
 What does he want to carry on? What will Peter do ? 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.210
 cech then make but still is 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.680
 did not win the game we have sat down 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:29.480
 Play 3 3 played as you remember 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.190
 can nice shot that was neat 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.290
 The goalkeeper has great taste 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.730
 parried would have been just like the 1 0 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.920
 they can look good but they came out well 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.590
 Run in tip defended on everyone 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.650
 case okay 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.330
 Only halfway we lead quite well 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.750
 well done so far thomas müller or 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.880
 chase or aubameyang the two gates there 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 We see this as the first since very nice came 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.730
 the defenders are not behind it 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.440
 a much better shot position there 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 peter cech did not arrive anymore 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.940
 Here are beautiful volley subtracted thomas 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 müller pa in it 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.960
 the first two gates very nice we 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.870
 nine shots have five of them on goal 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.820
 and they do not go there because quite crass 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.740
 the tip was well done so far so i 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.560
 I have to go to the 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.580
 pat tap 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.750
 I hope you do it that way too 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.880
 bit with your thumb up or 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.450
 with a comment somehow for me 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.950
 definitely looking forward 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.530
 we're coming, we want to continue 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.900
 Playing perhaps what had tactically 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.220
 changed I do not know 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.530
 It took a little bit 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.530
 maybe there to play again 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.470
 okay that he still arrives there many 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.990
 Roth sent him from the square I was like that 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.500
 good as by that was really awesome 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.500
 bad 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.980
 shit why play him 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:26.169
 yes, all a cheap fucking tor 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.779
 actually I would have the gate already 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.400
 where you still have to make them 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:33.900
 my goodness how cheap how cheap 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.340
 main thing in it 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.340
 13 o'clock these were our three points 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:50.949
 okay four gates counts or i would 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.169
 say rage quitt four gates a few 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:59.240
 Points 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.320
 ok that would be 8001 again for this 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.630
 our team I do not know how 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.910
 we currently have last game there 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.030
 I once again look 3 3 played 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.039
 last here it is again exactly 3 3 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.180
 a draw and 4 0 victory I have to 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.530
 actually register again 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.650
 ok so if that's correct now 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.449
 We calculated that we have 14,500 coins 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.750
 secretly times to see if again 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:25.100
 get something for 14,500 david alaba 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.740
 david alaba, if i get one 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.090
 a bit difficult well we have to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.970
 a bit further save ours so far 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.139
 team can improve 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:40.120
 there we have blaszczykowski I look 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:40.120
 how expensive the now is 5000 3600 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.460
 3300 have come at some point 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.539
 even if we get it for free 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:57.320
 we can kosky today and swap the 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:07:03.310
 we have him there with shaqiri and zack 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:06.470
 drinne for thomas müller at the moment yes 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.669
 but is actually quite good so good 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.620
 what did that stand for me 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.180
 Thank you for turning on 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.139
 for to see is also a thumb 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.520

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.780

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.070
