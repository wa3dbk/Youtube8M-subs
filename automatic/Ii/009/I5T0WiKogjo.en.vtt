doing barrel rolls through all the

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.650 
doing barrel rolls through all the
windmills<00:04:25.560> oh<00:04:25.889> man<00:04:26.520> that's<00:04:26.849> what<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.030> could<00:04:27.509> do

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660

pushing<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.599> objective<00:04:31.139> bro<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.550> cool

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
pushing the objective bro not not cool

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.370 
pushing the objective bro not not cool
at<00:04:33.060> all<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:33.479> there's<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.720> lot<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.960> action<00:04:34.349> going

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
at all but there's a lot of action going

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.219 
at all but there's a lot of action going
on<00:04:34.740> over<00:04:35.039> at<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.220> V<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.240> believe<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.050> going

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
on over at a V I believe this is going

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.230 
on over at a V I believe this is going
to<00:04:37.289> be<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.530> bee<00:04:37.949> capture<00:04:38.490> point<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.090> should

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
to be the bee capture point so we should

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.310 
to be the bee capture point so we should
probably<00:04:39.330> take<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> look<00:04:39.960> at<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.199> little

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
probably take a look at that a little

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.070 
probably take a look at that a little
bit<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.710> careful
