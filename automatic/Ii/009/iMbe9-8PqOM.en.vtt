00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.110 
me
I<00:03:39.060> already<00:03:39.930> did<00:03:40.290> buddy<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.579> while<00:03:41.699> there<00:03:42.000> was

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
I already did buddy and while there was

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.259 
I already did buddy and while there was
a<00:03:42.150> lag<00:03:42.389> there<00:03:42.419> you<00:03:43.139> saw<00:03:43.939> what<00:03:44.939> do<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.120> actually

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
a lag there you saw what do we actually

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.559 
a lag there you saw what do we actually
do<00:03:45.569> uh<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:46.379> think<00:03:46.859> this<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.159> that's<00:03:47.579> enough<00:03:47.849> what

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
do uh I think this is that's enough what

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.729 
do uh I think this is that's enough what
we<00:03:48.720> actually<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:49.049> in<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.259> classroom<00:03:49.500> is

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
we actually do in the classroom is

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.469 
we actually do in the classroom is
basically<00:03:50.280> when<00:03:50.519> we<00:03:50.609> don't<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.970> access<00:03:51.359> to

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
basically when we don't have access to

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.539 
basically when we don't have access to
the<00:03:51.569> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> third<00:03:52.979> device<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the Wi-Fi we have a third device and

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.550 
the Wi-Fi we have a third device and
Android<00:03:53.879> device<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.389> so<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.019> we<00:03:55.109> do

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
ok so I was talking about the Wi-Fi

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.349 
ok so I was talking about the Wi-Fi
hotspots<00:04:13.199> with<00:04:14.069> our<00:04:14.159> third<00:04:14.459> Android<00:04:15.030> device

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
hotspots with our third Android device

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.009 
hotspots with our third Android device
we<00:04:15.689> create<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.650> Wi-Fi<00:04:17.190> hotspot<00:04:17.820> there<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.570> we

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
we create a Wi-Fi hotspot there and we

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.009 
we create a Wi-Fi hotspot there and we
both<00:04:19.169> connected<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.859> Wi-Fi<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.849> that<00:04:21.659> Wi-Fi

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
both connected at Wi-Fi and that Wi-Fi

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.690 
both connected at Wi-Fi and that Wi-Fi
has<00:04:22.200> actually<00:04:22.560> full<00:04:22.740> signals<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.520> don't

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
has actually full signals so we don't

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.370 
has actually full signals so we don't
have<00:04:23.909> a

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
have a

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.480
