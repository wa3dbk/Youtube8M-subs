00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.280 
teenagers in so I think teenagers are a
really<00:03:17.890> hot<00:03:18.040> business<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.390> manner<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.720> I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
really hot business in the manner that I

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.860 
really hot business in the manner that I
think<00:03:20.950> teens<00:03:21.459> by<00:03:21.730> teens<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.420> look<00:03:22.570> at<00:03:22.690> new

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
think teens by teens you look at new

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.690 
think teens by teens you look at new
kids<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.320> block<00:03:23.410> that'll<00:03:24.310> tell<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.580> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
teens by teens and I think the teens

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.650 
teens by teens and I think the teens
would<00:03:28.330> probably<00:03:28.959> very<00:03:29.200> much<00:03:29.470> by<00:03:30.660> teenagers

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
would probably very much by teenagers

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.960 
would probably very much by teenagers
wrestling<00:03:32.230> teenagers<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.400> that's<00:03:33.790> why<00:03:33.940> we

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
wrestling teenagers and that's why we

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.580 
wrestling teenagers and that's why we
started<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.420> idea<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.720> teen<00:03:34.900> pro<00:03:35.080> wrestling<00:03:35.470> I
