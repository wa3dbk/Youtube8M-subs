00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
products when they go out the door are

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
products when they go out the door are
going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> fit<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> car<00:02:07.380> when<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.459> develop<00:02:08.850> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to fit the car when we develop a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570 
going to fit the car when we develop a
product<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:10.649> fit<00:02:10.860> made<00:02:11.310> prototypes

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
product will will fit made prototypes

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.420 
product will will fit made prototypes
for<00:02:12.090> vehicle<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:13.350> we'll<00:02:13.739> keep<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
for vehicle and then we'll keep that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.949 
for vehicle and then we'll keep that
prototype<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
prototype so that we know that is a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.449 
prototype so that we know that is a
perfect<00:02:16.380> fit<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.800> particular<00:02:17.100> model

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
perfect fit for that particular model

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.630 
perfect fit for that particular model
and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:19.020> develop<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> jig<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.459> that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and then we will develop a a jig so that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
and then we will develop a a jig so that
when<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> product<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.239> been<00:02:21.690> tested<00:02:22.080> and

when the product is been tested and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.790 
when the product is been tested and
tried<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.980> proven<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> move<00:02:24.239> into

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
tried and proven then we can move into

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.040
