alright<00:00:08.400> check<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.639> out<00:00:08.790> very<00:00:08.940> exciting<00:00:09.330> we're

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
alright check it out very exciting we're

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.750 
alright check it out very exciting we're
doing<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.900> two<00:00:10.170> gigabyte<00:00:10.559> gtx<00:00:10.770> 285<00:00:11.280> today

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
doing the two gigabyte gtx 285 today

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.360 
doing the two gigabyte gtx 285 today
very<00:00:12.299> very<00:00:12.510> nice<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.140> doubled<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:14.099> frame

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
very very nice they doubled the frame

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.530 
very very nice they doubled the frame
buffer<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.880> that's<00:00:15.180> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> give<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.510> some

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
buffer and that's going to give you some

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.880 
buffer and that's going to give you some
incredible<00:00:16.139> games<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> performance

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
incredible games and performance

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.500 
incredible games and performance
especially<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.939> you're<00:00:18.060> running<00:00:18.119> really

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
especially if you're running really

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
especially if you're running really
really<00:00:18.810> high<00:00:19.080> resolutions<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.740> 2560<00:00:20.520> by

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
really high resolutions like 2560 by

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.999 
really high resolutions like 2560 by
1600<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.900> additional<00:00:22.380> frame<00:00:22.560> buffer<00:00:22.860> will

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
1600 or the additional frame buffer will

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.220 
1600 or the additional frame buffer will
keep<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> GPU<00:00:23.759> fed<00:00:24.000> nicely<00:00:24.419> to<00:00:24.810> increase<00:00:25.200> your

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
keep the GPU fed nicely to increase your

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.690 
keep the GPU fed nicely to increase your
frame<00:00:25.560> rate<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.950> it's<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> stop<00:00:26.579> your

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
frame rate and it's going to stop your

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.670 
frame rate and it's going to stop your
fingertip<00:00:27.060> dropping<00:00:27.480> off<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:28.470> you're

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
fingertip dropping off if you're

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.530 
fingertip dropping off if you're
cranking<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.189> those<00:00:29.369> settings<00:00:29.759> especially<00:00:30.149> in

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
cranking up those settings especially in

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.200 
cranking up those settings especially in
games<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.009> crysis<00:00:32.030> especially<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.120> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
games like crysis especially when you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
games like crysis especially when you
turn<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.480> icandy<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.290> anti<00:00:34.590> aliasing<00:00:35.270> those

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
turn on icandy like anti aliasing those

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.810 
turn on icandy like anti aliasing those
things<00:00:36.650> really<00:00:37.650> kick<00:00:38.130> up<00:00:38.310> how<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.580> frame

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
things really kick up how much frame

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.920 
things really kick up how much frame
buffer<00:00:39.150> you<00:00:39.240> need<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> use<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.720> they<00:00:39.780> also

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
buffer you need to use and they also

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
buffer you need to use and they also
kick<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.350> hard<00:00:40.650> drive<00:00:40.830> usage<00:00:40.980> sometimes

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
kick up your hard drive usage sometimes

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
kick up your hard drive usage sometimes
as<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:42.600> trying<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> buffer

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
as well when you're trying to buffer

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.040 
as well when you're trying to buffer
this<00:00:43.200> massive<00:00:43.620> image<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:45.150> nice<00:00:45.510> card<00:00:45.870> now

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
this massive image so very nice card now

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
this massive image so very nice card now
looking<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.560> it<00:00:46.710> looks<00:00:47.250> pretty<00:00:47.460> normal<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
looking at it looks pretty normal in the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.460 
looking at it looks pretty normal in the
front<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.570> back<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.080> your

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
front and on the back it is your

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.860 
front and on the back it is your
standard<00:00:49.920> reference<00:00:50.640> design<00:00:51.150> nothing<00:00:51.780> really

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
standard reference design nothing really

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.740 
standard reference design nothing really
special<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.180> everything<00:00:54.180> else<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
special on here but everything else you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.300 
special on here but everything else you
know<00:00:54.780> obviously<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.290> looks<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.680> cool<00:00:55.890> no

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
know obviously it looks really cool no

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.520 
know obviously it looks really cool no
backplate<00:00:56.790> unfortunately<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.350> still

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
backplate unfortunately but it's still

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.470 
backplate unfortunately but it's still
okay<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.040> let's<00:00:59.430> talk<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.579> frequencies

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
okay now let's talk about frequencies

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
okay now let's talk about frequencies
reference<00:01:00.990> frequencies<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.650> GPU<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.250> GPU

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
reference frequencies for the GPU so GPU

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.069 
reference frequencies for the GPU so GPU

supplies it's a 204 watt TDP and when
you<00:02:13.380> overclock<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.010> goes<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.400> bit

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you overclock it it goes a little bit

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240 
you overclock it it goes a little bit
higher<00:02:14.820> I'd<00:02:15.000> say<00:02:15.120> about<00:02:15.270> 2<00:02:15.480> 15<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:16.560> 10<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.100> not

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
higher I'd say about 2 15 to 10 it's not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.230 
higher I'd say about 2 15 to 10 it's not
