00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
about 70 to 100 bucks depending on where

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.120 
about 70 to 100 bucks depending on where
you<00:00:33.300> find<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.200> wanted<00:00:34.829> something<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
was a little thicker

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
was a little thicker
that<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.360> comfortable<00:00:36.809> since<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.350> not

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that would be comfortable since I'm not

that would be comfortable since I'm not
necessarily<00:00:37.680> backpacking<00:00:38.700> though<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
necessarily backpacking though this is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.030

self-inflating<00:00:44.040> mattress<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:45.090> I've

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
self-inflating mattress but I've

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.029 
self-inflating mattress but I've
probably<00:00:45.629> spent<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> total<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.469> twenty

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
probably spent a total of twenty

it
it's<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> perfect<00:00:50.550> thickness<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.420> find<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it's the perfect thickness I find that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650 
it's the perfect thickness I find that
you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.370> sleeping<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> extremely

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

you know sleeping on it is extremely
comfortable<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> things<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> learned

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
comfortable one of the things I learned

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.580 
comfortable one of the things I learned
early<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.539> had<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> tendency<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> over

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
early on is I had a tendency to over

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
early on is I had a tendency to over
inflate<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> thing<00:00:59.309> usually<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> pop

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
inflate this thing usually when I pop

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.549 
inflate this thing usually when I pop
the<00:01:00.510> cap<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> leave<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the cap and leave it in there for a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
the cap and leave it in there for a
little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.949> let<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> self<00:01:02.370> inflate<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
little bit and let it self inflate if I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
little bit and let it self inflate if I
just<00:01:03.570> close<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.379> perfect<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
just close it it's about perfect the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
just close it it's about perfect the
first<00:01:06.030> couple<00:01:06.270> nights<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.570> had<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> blew<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
first couple nights I had it I blew a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.810 
first couple nights I had it I blew a
little<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:07.830> air<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> was

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
little more air in there and then it was

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
little more air in there and then it was
too<00:01:09.270> firm<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> customize

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
too firm but you know you can customize

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.890 
too firm but you know you can customize
and<00:01:11.310> adjust<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.180> got<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.510> different

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and adjust it it's got these different

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
and adjust it it's got these different
baffles<00:01:13.409> built-in<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.010> don't<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.369> see

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
baffles built-in I don't if you can see

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
baffles built-in I don't if you can see
the<00:01:14.640> dot<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> video<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.409> for

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the dot from the video in here but for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
the dot from the video in here but for
different<00:01:16.979> zones<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.700> weight<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.299> there's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
different zones of weight so there's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.780 
different zones of weight so there's
just<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.140> line<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
just a line of them here but like the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
just a line of them here but like the
weight<00:01:20.970> zones<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.409> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> laid

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
weight zones so it's all kind of laid

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
weight zones so it's all kind of laid
out<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.170> far<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.409> best<00:01:25.830> design

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
out that you know as far as best design

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.289 
out that you know as far as best design
for<00:01:26.820> people<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.840> sleep<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.820> stats<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
for people to sleep on so some stats on

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.190 
for people to sleep on so some stats on
this<00:01:30.509> thing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this thing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.429 
this thing
it's<00:01:31.740> r-value<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.310> 4.8<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> pretty

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it's r-value is 4.8 so it's got a pretty

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.050 
it's r-value is 4.8 so it's got a pretty
high<00:01:34.650> AR<00:01:35.460> rating<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:37.040> roughly<00:01:38.040> 2<00:01:38.340> pounds<00:01:38.729> 11

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
high AR rating it's roughly 2 pounds 11

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
high AR rating it's roughly 2 pounds 11
ounces<00:01:39.979> it's<00:01:41.360> again<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> 2<00:01:42.780> inch<00:01:42.960> pad<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
ounces it's again it's a 2 inch pad it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
ounces it's again it's a 2 inch pad it's
about<00:01:44.399> 25<00:01:44.880> inches<00:01:45.030> wide<00:01:45.500> 77<00:01:46.500> inches<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
about 25 inches wide 77 inches long this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.560 
about 25 inches wide 77 inches long this
is<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> regular<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.360> long<00:01:48.540> and

another<00:02:13.480> pad<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.960> four<00:02:14.290> inch<00:02:14.440> pad<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
another pad is the four inch pad that I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.770 
another pad is the four inch pad that I
used<00:02:15.100> when<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.250> was<00:02:15.310> truck<00:02:15.670> camping<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.420> I
