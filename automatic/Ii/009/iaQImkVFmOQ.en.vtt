 grass point com and this is a video 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.889
 review of this new product 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 just arrived of this speaker of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.910
 ultrasonic aromas 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 we chose to make it do it 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 unpacking too for the first one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 time because we have just arrived 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 we took a price for ours 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.940
 office so we wanted to unpack it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 together with you and see how it worked 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.410
 with with essential oils 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.739
 the product you find here is the most 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 large of the three is called rondò e 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.579
 covers an area up to 75 meters 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.780
 paintings while for smaller rooms 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:06.030
 there are also the other two versions of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.060
 which one a cone and one a pyramid that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.220
 they cover about 25 30 square meters then 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 maybe for small rooms a little smaller 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 this is how it looks in this box 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 where we see a summary in front 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 in short, his own 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:43.850
 features 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:47.790
 now let's go and open it you're here there's the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 then manual of instructions 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.610
 we will also see how it is used live 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.149
 because we will also do this for the first 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.570
 time then I unpack it to here is the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.670
 produced however to usual clearly 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.579
 two year warranty though 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.399
 the label says that having no pieces of 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.800
 wear therefore does not consider it does not consider 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.800
 spare parts ok however there is always the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.140
 manufacturer's guarantee that the cast iron 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:23.099
 we find wellness in his bag 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.580
 of tar before you own the e 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.879
 new 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 we have never even opened one ourselves 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:37.860
 office here he is with his buttons 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.310
 switch on timer 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.629
 there is a timer then there is the key for the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.800
 power of the vaporization and now 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.110
 we will see how well we use it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.569
 connected 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.970
 the power supply to the device and to one 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.220
 something I have not shown you the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.550
 discovery after that from new 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.269
 the power supply is inside the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.780
 cover 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.819
 ok so April will be enough for you now 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.690
 cover remove a limiter e 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.330
 connect it under the appliance once 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.470
 that the appliance is open 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.269
 this graduated tray where we will go to 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.180
 put ok water up to a maximum 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.159
 of 500 mm therefore in half liter 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.159
 they took a glass 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.870
 they are about 100 milliliters and I will go to 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.200
 put essential oils 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.220
 we have chosen the now very famous oil 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.830
 31 of the sangalli therefore ne 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.690
 enough for oil 31 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.170
 as many will know very few drops 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.850
 even for 100 milliliters 3 4 5 drops 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.850
 they are more than enough 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.489
 you go to close the lid is not there 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.980
 there is nothing interlocking is just a 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.970
 support, however, to work 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.450
 it is also written in the manual 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:20.780
 clearly before turning it on koper 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.780
 clear here lights up let's see some 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.070
 so then it doesn't turn on much 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.450
 probably because there is not enough 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.670
 water therefore for safety the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.980
 appliance turns off now I go to 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.050
 take some other ok water I have 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.720
 poured another glass of water 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:58.330
 now we are just over 300 milliliters 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.200
 the appliance works and you see how 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.930
 instantly and probably puts 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.830
 you can't see in the video camera but you are 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:16.950
 putting up the smoke with this hold up 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.950
 much more smoke is coming out of power 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.490
 let's show it 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.210
 here 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.080
 here with this button you can also make 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.080
 chromotherapy 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.930
 more color changes by itself 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.330
 instead they continue to press the button 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:06:00.169
 mist the timer set is changed 60 120 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:05.539
 180 minutes and then the appliance turns off 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.190
 only 15 of them here tend 120 180 if yes 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.280
 leave it on 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.600
 the appliance will never stop unless 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.070
 that a water level arrives 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:21.340
 so low that it will turn itself off and 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.340
 then it is expected another time it turns off 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.440
 so I repeat this device 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:36.090
 called rondò was fabricated for 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:40.590
 cover an area of ​​about 70 75 meters 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:44.520
 paintings there are the other two models that 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.800
 cover an area of ​​20 25 square meters 30 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.380
 therefore smaller instances found 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.120
 product data sheets and all 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.669
 features of these models on the 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.210
