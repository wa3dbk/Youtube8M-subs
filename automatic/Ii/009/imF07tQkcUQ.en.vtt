expressive distortion it's a it's a DSP
circuit<00:01:01.480> um<00:01:01.690> they're<00:01:02.170> calling<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.649> spectral

DSP<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:04.720> crazy<00:01:05.229> it's<00:01:05.710> compression

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.350 
DSP it's crazy it's compression
it's<00:01:07.539> an<00:01:07.869> EQ<00:01:08.590> that's<00:01:08.890> accenting<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.670> lows<00:01:09.970> are

it's an EQ that's accenting the lows are

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's an EQ that's accenting the lows are
the<00:01:10.450> highs<00:01:10.690> as<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.229> twist<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.770> very<00:01:12.610> hard<00:01:12.910> to

nothing I've ever heard before there's a
control<00:01:17.679> jack<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.990> plug<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.350> an

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
control jack so that you can plug in an

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.160 
control jack so that you can plug in an
expression<00:01:21.130> pedal<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.670> sweep<00:01:22.270> through<00:01:22.630> the

right<00:02:33.220> into<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:35.140> DAW<00:02:35.530> here<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.160> bypassed<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
right into my DAW here is bypassed and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.320 
right into my DAW here is bypassed and
here<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.920> tone<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.700> center<00:02:43.030> which<00:02:43.299> is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
here is the tone in the center which is

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.500 
here is the tone in the center which is
no<00:02:43.630> boost<00:02:43.900> or<00:02:44.260> no<00:02:44.470> cut<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.250> analog<00:02:45.760> distortion

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
no boost or no cut the analog distortion

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.460 
no boost or no cut the analog distortion
side<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.080> extortion<00:02:47.410> pedal

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:06.020 

so<00:02:53.470> let<00:02:53.740> me<00:02:53.800> dial<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.630> drive<00:02:55.900> back<00:02:56.290> here

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.240 

you<00:03:07.030> come<00:03:07.299> up<00:03:07.450> with<00:03:07.720> some<00:03:08.049> crazy<00:03:08.260> blues<00:03:08.680> sounds

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you come up with some crazy blues sounds

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:22.289 
you come up with some crazy blues sounds
easily<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.769> then<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.609> take<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.970> all<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
easily and then you can take it all the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:39.420 
easily and then you can take it all the
way<00:03:22.480> back<00:03:23.439> to<00:03:23.650> level<00:03:23.920> off<00:03:24.750> that's<00:03:25.750> 3/4

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.399 

it's<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.489> great<00:03:40.730> pedal<00:03:41.090> complete<00:03:41.659> bypass

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
it's a great pedal complete bypass

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.679 
it's a great pedal complete bypass
analog<00:03:42.980> now<00:03:43.310> let's<00:03:43.790> click<00:03:44.030> kick<00:03:44.360> in<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
analog now let's click kick in the

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.530 
analog now let's click kick in the
spectral<00:03:45.200> DSP<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.980> sweep<00:03:46.640> through<00:03:47.000> some<00:03:47.420> of

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
spectral DSP and sweep through some of

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.740 
spectral DSP and sweep through some of
this<00:03:47.629> funkiness<00:03:49.030> they<00:03:50.030> say<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.420> adds

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this funkiness they say it adds

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.360 
this funkiness they say it adds
distortion<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.590> low<00:03:51.799> strings<00:03:52.129> of<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
distortion to the low strings of the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.869 
distortion to the low strings of the
high<00:03:52.549> strings<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.650> some<00:03:54.890> compression<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.730> can

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
high strings and some compression I can

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.610 
high strings and some compression I can
really<00:03:56.120> hear<00:03:56.470> it's<00:03:57.470> really<00:03:57.769> low<00:03:58.010> bass<00:03:58.370> heavy

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.860 

and<00:04:03.620> then<00:04:03.829> I'll<00:04:03.980> just<00:04:04.220> kind<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.909> add<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.750> know

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
and then I'll just kind of add you know

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:18.550 
and then I'll just kind of add you know
twist<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.409> down<00:04:06.439> a<00:04:06.590> little<00:04:06.829> more

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.340 

yeah<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> highs<00:04:19.829> are<00:04:19.859> really<00:04:20.310> flat

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.560 

sounds<00:04:26.350> like<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.470> mid<00:04:26.740> boost<00:04:27.009> now<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.419> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
sounds like a mid boost now you know the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.320 
sounds like a mid boost now you know the
more<00:04:31.720> twist<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.000> probably

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
more twist it this is that probably

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.870 
more twist it this is that probably
night<00:04:34.570> our<00:04:34.840> three<00:04:35.080> o'clock

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
night our three o'clock

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.840 
night our three o'clock
yeah<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.090> highs<00:04:37.270> are<00:04:37.509> getting<00:04:38.639> really<00:04:39.639> more

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
yeah the highs are getting really more

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.640 
yeah the highs are getting really more
pronounced<00:04:40.509> almost<00:04:40.900> like<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:42.610> there's<00:04:42.910> a

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
pronounced almost like like there's a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:55.589 
pronounced almost like like there's a
compulsive<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.800> compressor

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:02.570 

and<00:04:56.599> then<00:04:57.289> let's<00:04:57.469> go<00:04:57.889> ahead<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.159> crank

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:12.410 

let<00:05:03.540> me<00:05:03.660> take<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.290> DSP<00:05:05.040> side<00:05:05.280> out<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:12.150> that's

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
let me take the DSP side out and that's

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.750 
let me take the DSP side out and that's
back<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:12.870> here's<00:05:13.530> out<00:05:19.370> what<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> huge
