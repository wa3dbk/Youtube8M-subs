it's hard to remember maybe when it was
one

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.240 

there<00:00:53.600> has<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:53.870> be<00:00:54.020> some<00:00:54.230> chess<00:00:54.710> culture

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
there has to be some chess culture

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.970 
there has to be some chess culture
within<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.550> family<00:00:56.059> for<00:00:56.809> young<00:00:57.320> person<00:00:57.860> to

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
within the family for young person to

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.500 
within the family for young person to
start<00:00:58.309> playing<00:00:58.610> chess<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:59.090> think<00:00:59.390> it's

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
start playing chess I think it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.810 
start playing chess I think it's
important<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.370> fathers<00:01:01.370> teach<00:01:01.610> their

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
important that fathers teach their

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.390 
important that fathers teach their
daughters<00:01:02.030> chess

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
daughters chess

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.130 
daughters chess
what<00:01:04.400> about<00:01:04.580> their<00:01:04.729> mothers<00:01:05.059> things<00:01:05.479> see<00:01:05.990> that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
what about their mothers things see that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.420 
what about their mothers things see that
that's<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.710> reason<00:01:06.950> that's<00:01:07.009> not<00:01:07.220> going<00:01:07.340> to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
that's the reason that's not going to

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.590 
that's the reason that's not going to
happen<00:01:07.580> right<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:07.940> just<00:01:08.210> because<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.390> have

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
happen right now just because you have

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.330 
happen right now just because you have
you're<00:01:08.869> already<00:01:09.050> starting<00:01:09.320> from<00:01:10.159> the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
you're already starting from the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.070 
you're already starting from the
position<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.300> lot<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.600> women<00:01:11.750> are<00:01:11.960> not

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
position that a lot of women are not

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.410 
position that a lot of women are not
playing<00:01:12.320> chess<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.040> it<00:01:13.159> automatically<00:01:13.970> has<00:01:14.240> to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
playing chess so it automatically has to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.719 
playing chess so it automatically has to
be<00:01:14.590> father's<00:01:15.590> teaching<00:01:16.220> their<00:01:16.369> daughters

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
be father's teaching their daughters

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.620 
be father's teaching their daughters
tests<00:01:17.119> girls<00:01:17.720> actually<00:01:18.460> seem<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.490> want<00:01:20.360> to

tests girls actually seem to want to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.840 
tests girls actually seem to want to
learn<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.990> more<00:01:21.140> because<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:22.340> kind<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.700> like

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
learn it more because it's kind of like

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.600

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.410 
to help them to develop some abilities
like<00:02:57.750> memory<00:02:58.500> concentration<00:02:59.180> attention<00:03:00.180> in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
like memory concentration attention in

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.420 
like memory concentration attention in
chess<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.930> try<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> take<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> decision<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
chess you try to take a decision and you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.490 
chess you try to take a decision and you
cannot<00:03:02.640> take<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:02.910> back<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.510> that's<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.380> way

it happens in life

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.630 
it happens in life
I<00:03:05.760> think<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.300> obvious<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:07.590> women<00:03:08.160> take

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
I think it's obvious that if women take

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.880 
I think it's obvious that if women take
the<00:03:08.850> time<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.390> study<00:03:09.720> they<00:03:10.050> can<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.410> just<00:03:10.680> as

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the time and study they can be just as

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.920 
the time and study they can be just as
good<00:03:11.100> as<00:03:11.250> men<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.790> first<00:03:12.060> time<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.660> beat

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
good as men the first time that you beat

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.070
