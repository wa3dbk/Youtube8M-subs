we've got a few tips for when you're

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.050 
we've got a few tips for when you're
receiving<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.160> ball<00:00:22.280> and<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:22.730> defending

and nicking it away we've got a few

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.220 
and nicking it away we've got a few
techniques<00:00:25.940> here<00:00:26.180> that<00:00:26.330> will<00:00:26.420> hopefully<00:00:26.570> buy

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
techniques here that will hopefully buy

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.630 
techniques here that will hopefully buy
you<00:00:27.289> some<00:00:27.500> space<00:00:27.680> now<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.190> does<00:00:28.340> happen<00:00:28.490> to

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
you some space now this does happen to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.279 
you some space now this does happen to
me<00:00:28.789> quite<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.150> lot<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.449> it's<00:00:29.570> very<00:00:29.630> frustrating

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
me quite a lot and it's very frustrating

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.960 
me quite a lot and it's very frustrating
so<00:00:30.410> what<00:00:30.529> can<00:00:30.619> we<00:00:30.680> do<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:30.920> counter<00:00:31.190> this<00:00:31.279> one<00:00:31.910> of

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
so what can we do to counter this one of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.279 
so what can we do to counter this one of
the<00:00:32.059> things<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.419> often<00:00:32.570> works<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.079> letting

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
the things that often works is letting

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.779 
the things that often works is letting
the<00:00:33.350> ball<00:00:33.499> run<00:00:33.679> through<00:00:33.890> your<00:00:33.980> legs<00:00:34.159> and<00:00:34.609> you

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
the ball run through your legs and you

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.040 
the ball run through your legs and you
can<00:00:34.909> do<00:00:34.999> this<00:00:35.179> just<00:00:35.269> by<00:00:35.449> holding<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.929> right

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
can do this just by holding the right

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.329 
can do this just by holding the right
bumper<00:00:36.289> down<00:00:36.499> as<00:00:36.679> you<00:00:36.769> receive<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.069> pass

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
bumper down as you receive the pass

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.099 
bumper down as you receive the pass
obviously<00:00:38.239> then<00:00:38.359> your<00:00:38.480> player<00:00:38.629> will<00:00:38.719> kind<00:00:38.989> of

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
obviously then your player will kind of

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.750 
obviously then your player will kind of
step<00:00:39.649> over<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:39.979> ball<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:40.370> would<00:00:40.519> continue

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
step over the ball and it would continue

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.759 
step over the ball and it would continue
to<00:00:40.879> run<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.269> and<00:00:41.510> what<00:00:41.989> you're<00:00:42.109> relying<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:42.499> is

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
to run on and what you're relying on is

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.860 
to run on and what you're relying on is
the<00:00:42.949> defender<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.670> moving<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.479> the<00:00:44.510> left<00:00:44.600> or

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
the defender is moving to the left or

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.790 
the defender is moving to the left or
the<00:00:44.929> right<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.229> come<00:00:45.379> around<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.620> make<00:00:45.769> a

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
the right to come around to make a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.319 
the right to come around to make a
tackle<00:00:46.069> so<00:00:46.460> hopefully<00:00:46.819> there<00:00:46.969> should<00:00:47.120> be<00:00:47.239> the

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
tackle so hopefully there should be the

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.119 
tackle so hopefully there should be the
space<00:00:47.539> there<00:00:47.809> for<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.440> ball<00:00:48.589> to<00:00:48.739> run<00:00:48.889> through

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
space there for the ball to run through

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.469 
space there for the ball to run through
I<00:00:49.309> mean<00:00:49.460> one<00:00:49.609> of<00:00:49.639> two<00:00:50.030> things<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:50.300> would<00:00:50.359> say

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
I mean one of two things I would say

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:51.160 
I mean one of two things I would say
about<00:00:50.809> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
about it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.289 
about it
use<00:00:52.010> experinece<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.760> want<00:00:52.909> to<00:00:52.969> do<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.120> all<00:00:53.179> the

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
use experinece I want to do it all the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:54.789 
use experinece I want to do it all the
time<00:00:53.359> because<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.929> defending<00:00:54.319> player<00:00:54.350> is

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
time because the defending player is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.079 
time because the defending player is
going<00:00:54.889> to<00:00:54.949> anticipate<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.609> like<00:00:55.789> like<00:00:55.940> any

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
going to anticipate it like like any

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.939 
going to anticipate it like like any
skill<00:00:56.269> move<00:00:56.539> really<00:00:56.719> when<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.530> second<00:00:57.769> one<00:00:57.859> is

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
skill move really when the second one is

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.619 
skill move really when the second one is
you<00:00:58.010> need<00:00:58.100> quite<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.429> lot<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.609> power<00:00:58.850> on<00:00:59.569> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you need quite a lot of power on the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.079 
you need quite a lot of power on the
original<00:01:00.289> pass<00:01:00.499> so<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:00.949> once<00:01:01.639> you've<00:01:01.879> let

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
original pass so that once you've let

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.309 
original pass so that once you've let
the<00:01:02.179> ball<00:01:02.329> run<00:01:02.479> through<00:01:02.659> your<00:01:02.749> legs<00:01:02.899> there's

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
the ball run through your legs there's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.170 
the ball run through your legs there's
space<00:01:03.889> between<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.640> defendants<00:01:05.089> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
space between you and the defendants and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.609 
space between you and the defendants and
you<00:01:05.269> can<00:01:05.420> run<00:01:05.539> on<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.719> ball<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.110> get<00:01:06.259> away<00:01:06.500> if

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
you can run on the ball and get away if

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.859 
you can run on the ball and get away if
it's<00:01:06.829> too<00:01:07.039> soft<00:01:07.280> it'll<00:01:08.240> be<00:01:08.299> too<00:01:08.450> close<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
it's too soft it'll be too close to the

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.719 
it's too soft it'll be too close to the
defender<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.320> you'd<00:01:09.649> probably<00:01:09.799> catch<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.280> so

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
defender and you'd probably catch you so

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.010 
defender and you'd probably catch you so
letting<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.030> ball<00:01:11.180> run<00:01:11.360> through<00:01:11.570> your<00:01:11.750> leg<00:01:11.869> is

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
letting the ball run through your leg is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.539 
letting the ball run through your leg is
a<00:01:12.049> great<00:01:12.320> tip<00:01:12.530> what's<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.920> next<00:01:13.039> one<00:01:13.219> one<00:01:13.490> of

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
a great tip what's the next one one of

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.889 
a great tip what's the next one one of
the<00:01:13.610> ones<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.850> really<00:01:14.000> like<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.570> simple

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
the ones I really like is the simple

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.810 
the ones I really like is the simple
spin<00:01:15.110> turn<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.500> use<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.829> quite<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.009> lot<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:16.700> you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
spin turn I use it quite a lot so as you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.639 
spin turn I use it quite a lot so as you
can<00:01:16.939> see<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.149> this<00:01:17.240> clip<00:01:17.509> I<00:01:17.689> originally<00:01:18.380> start

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
can see in this clip I originally start

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.380 
can see in this clip I originally start
to<00:01:18.740> turn<00:01:18.920> with<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.640> direction<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.180> ball

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
to turn with the direction of the ball

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.149 
to turn with the direction of the ball
so<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.689> guy's<00:01:20.810> turning<00:01:21.259> into<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.680> path<00:01:21.859> of<00:01:22.009> it

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
so the guy's turning into the path of it

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.980 
so the guy's turning into the path of it
and<00:01:22.430> then<00:01:22.789> as<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.060> get<00:01:23.240> halfway<00:01:23.479> around<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
and then as I get halfway around the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.569 
and then as I get halfway around the
turn<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> use<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.560> left<00:01:24.680> stick<00:01:24.859> to<00:01:25.159> spin<00:01:25.369> back

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
turn I use the left stick to spin back

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.190 
turn I use the left stick to spin back
the<00:01:25.759> other<00:01:25.850> way<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.210> go<00:01:26.630> off<00:01:26.719> into<00:01:26.869> space

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the other way and go off into space

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.800 
the other way and go off into space
again<00:01:28.100> here<00:01:28.640> you're<00:01:28.850> you're<00:01:29.149> relying<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
again here you're you're relying on the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.690 
again here you're you're relying on the
defending<00:01:30.380> player<00:01:30.409> reading<00:01:31.219> your<00:01:31.340> initial

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
defending player reading your initial

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.399 
defending player reading your initial
term<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.179> moving<00:01:32.840> round<00:01:33.020> into<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.320> position

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
term and moving round into a position

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.779 
term and moving round into a position
where<00:01:33.740> he<00:01:33.979> thinks<00:01:34.219> he'll<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.369> able<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.549> tackle

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
where he thinks he'll be able to tackle

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.370 
where he thinks he'll be able to tackle
you<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.149> obviously<00:01:35.539> you've<00:01:35.960> spun<00:01:36.170> away

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
you in and obviously you've spun away

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.660 
you in and obviously you've spun away
into<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.679> space<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.130> if<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.250> time<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:37.460> well

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
into the space and if you time it well

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.010 
into the space and if you time it well
it<00:01:37.789> can<00:01:37.909> work<00:01:38.030> really<00:01:38.060> nicely<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:38.750> what's<00:01:38.929> your

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
it can work really nicely so what's your

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.749 
it can work really nicely so what's your
next<00:01:39.140> tip<00:01:39.439> for<00:01:39.679> mixing<00:01:39.950> things<00:01:40.100> up<00:01:40.280> yeah<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
next tip for mixing things up yeah the

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.279 
next tip for mixing things up yeah the
next<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:41.090> why<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.689> bit<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> space<00:01:42.109> is

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
next one why you a bit of space is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.719 
next one why you a bit of space is
running<00:01:42.740> back<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.100> direction<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
running back in the direction that the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.279 
running back in the direction that the
past<00:01:43.939> has<00:01:44.090> come<00:01:44.240> from<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:45.140> can<00:01:45.229> see

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
past has come from so as you can see

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.230 
past has come from so as you can see
here<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.859> received<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.609> ball<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:46.909> then<00:01:46.999> I<00:01:47.090> head

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
here I received the ball and then I head

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.489 
here I received the ball and then I head
straight<00:01:47.390> back<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.990> direction<00:01:48.109> of<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
straight back in the direction of the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.800 
straight back in the direction of the
pass<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.729> come<00:01:49.909> from<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.420> defender

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
pass and was come from and the defender

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.109 
pass and was come from and the defender
has<00:01:50.929> followed<00:01:51.289> me<00:01:51.859> out<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.820> leaves<00:01:52.969> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
has followed me out and that leaves a

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.639 
has followed me out and that leaves a
little<00:01:53.270> bit<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> gap<00:01:53.659> behind<00:01:54.289> him<00:01:54.499> which

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
little bit of a gap behind him which

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.440 
little bit of a gap behind him which
hopefully<00:01:55.070> then<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.490> either<00:01:55.939> turn<00:01:56.240> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
hopefully then I can either turn and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.120 
hopefully then I can either turn and
head<00:01:56.600> towards<00:01:57.079> or<00:01:57.289> I<00:01:57.319> can<00:01:57.560> pass<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.890> off<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.100> a

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
head towards or I can pass it off to a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.830 
head towards or I can pass it off to a
teammate<00:01:58.520> who<00:01:58.640> can<00:01:58.850> maybe<00:01:59.030> play<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.359> back<00:01:59.539> into

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
teammate who can maybe play it back into

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.260 
teammate who can maybe play it back into
that<00:01:59.960> space<00:02:00.399> another<00:02:01.399> reason<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.759> really<00:02:02.149> like

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
that space another reason I really like

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.700 
that space another reason I really like
this<00:02:02.390> move<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.810> once<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.289> defending

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
this move is that once the defending

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.859 
this move is that once the defending
player<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.399> was<00:02:04.549> realized<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.179> tend<00:02:05.780> to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
player and was realized that you tend to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.989 
player and was realized that you tend to
buy<00:02:06.049> space<00:02:06.319> in<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.619> way<00:02:06.799> he<00:02:07.159> may<00:02:07.310> hold<00:02:07.789> his

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
buy space in this way he may hold his

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.670 
buy space in this way he may hold his
position<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.420> stop<00:02:08.630> following<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.020> out<00:02:09.200> and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
position and stop following you out and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.050 
position and stop following you out and
of<00:02:09.800> course<00:02:09.950> effectively<00:02:10.430> that<00:02:10.610> gives<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
of course effectively that gives you the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.460 
of course effectively that gives you the
initial<00:02:11.240> space<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.990> were<00:02:12.080> looking<00:02:12.320> for

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
initial space you were looking for

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.339 
initial space you were looking for
anyway<00:02:12.710> so<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.040> can

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
anyway so you can

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
anyway so you can
and<00:02:13.769> continue<00:02:14.249> with<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.400> attack<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.299> your

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and continue with your attack so your

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.849 
and continue with your attack so your
next<00:02:15.629> tip<00:02:15.749> is<00:02:15.840> actually<00:02:15.959> about<00:02:16.379> turning<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
next tip is actually about turning and

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.080 
next tip is actually about turning and
spinning<00:02:17.129> at<00:02:17.219> using<00:02:17.400> protect<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> ball<00:02:17.939> isn't

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
spinning at using protect the ball isn't

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.149 
spinning at using protect the ball isn't
it<00:02:18.239> yeah<00:02:18.840> um<00:02:19.079> it<00:02:19.230> works<00:02:19.409> in<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> similar<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
it yeah um it works in a similar way to

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.860 
it yeah um it works in a similar way to
running<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.849> into<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> ball<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
running back into the ball you know you

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.809 
running back into the ball you know you
want<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.230> defender<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.680> edge<00:02:23.129> around<00:02:23.249> you<00:02:23.609> so

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
want the defender to edge around you so

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.339 
want the defender to edge around you so
as<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.389> receive<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.749> pass<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.079> hold<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
as you receive the pass you hold the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.809 
as you receive the pass you hold the
left<00:02:25.469> trigger<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.099> your<00:02:26.280> body<00:02:26.549> between

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
left trigger to get your body between

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.089 
left trigger to get your body between
the<00:02:26.939> ball<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.329> defender<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.959> then<00:02:28.499> watch

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the ball and the defender and then watch

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.770 
the ball and the defender and then watch
the<00:02:29.310> defender<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.909> watch<00:02:30.120> his<00:02:30.269> movement<00:02:30.689> if

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the defender and watch his movement if

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.149 
the defender and watch his movement if
he<00:02:30.870> starts<00:02:31.139> to<00:02:31.260> head<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.620> your<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.799> or<00:02:32.010> your

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
he starts to head to your right or your

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.309 
he starts to head to your right or your
left<00:02:32.280> obviously<00:02:32.909> left<00:02:33.329> stick<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.930> spin<00:02:34.139> turn

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
left obviously left stick and spin turn

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.229 
left obviously left stick and spin turn
into<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.159> direction<00:02:35.340> where<00:02:35.639> the<00:02:35.670> gap<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:35.879> I

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
into the direction where the gap is I

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.819 
into the direction where the gap is I
find<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.659> move<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.260> effective<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.739> it's

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
find this move really effective and it's

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.199 
find this move really effective and it's
one<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> use<00:02:38.159> quite<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> lot<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.879> know<00:02:38.939> it's<00:02:39.060> good

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
one I use quite a lot you know it's good

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.539 
one I use quite a lot you know it's good
because<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.560> defending<00:02:40.950> player<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.340> quite

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
because if the defending player is quite

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.039 
because if the defending player is quite
impatient<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.269> really<00:02:42.540> confident<00:02:42.870> again

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
impatient and is really confident again

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.179 
impatient and is really confident again
of<00:02:43.169> coming<00:02:43.439> in<00:02:43.530> looking<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.859> ball<00:02:44.010> then

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
of coming in looking the ball then

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.399 
of coming in looking the ball then
eventually<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.599> start<00:02:45.870> protecting<00:02:46.139> he

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
eventually when you start protecting he

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.569 
eventually when you start protecting he
is<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.799> edge<00:02:46.919> around<00:02:47.040> one<00:02:47.310> where<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
is going to edge around one where the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.649 
is going to edge around one where the
other<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.299> time<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> go

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
other one and that's the time to go

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.300 
other one and that's the time to go
through<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.870> space<00:02:49.049> before<00:02:49.829> we<00:02:49.889> go<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.219> you've

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
through the space before we go if you've

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.159 
through the space before we go if you've
got<00:02:50.400> any<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:50.609> tips<00:02:50.760> yeah<00:02:51.359> I<00:02:51.389> use<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.840> first

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
got any more tips yeah I use the first

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.569 
got any more tips yeah I use the first
time<00:02:52.349> flick<00:02:52.650> quite<00:02:52.949> a<00:02:52.980> lot<00:02:53.129> too

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
time flick quite a lot too

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.159 
time flick quite a lot too
it's<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> little<00:02:54.269> bit<00:02:54.359> trickier<00:02:54.689> this<00:02:54.989> year

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
it's a little bit trickier this year

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.059 
it's a little bit trickier this year
because<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.409> have<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> hold<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.919> right

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
because you have to hold the right

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
because you have to hold the right
trigger<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.579> then<00:02:57.060> flick<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.359> right<00:02:57.510> stick

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
trigger and then flick the right stick

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.939 
trigger and then flick the right stick
in<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.959> direction<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:58.500> want<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> turn

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
in the direction that you want to turn

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.709 
in the direction that you want to turn
and<00:02:59.730> there's<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.879> couple<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.180> ways<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.329> use<00:03:00.569> it

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
and there's a couple of ways to use it

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.449 
and there's a couple of ways to use it
but<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> way<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.139> I<00:03:01.199> really<00:03:01.469> like<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.829> here

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
but the way that I really like is here

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.220 
but the way that I really like is here
you<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.969> this<00:03:03.060> clip<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.359> I've<00:03:04.019> used

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
you can see in this clip that I've used

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
you can see in this clip that I've used
it<00:03:04.439> just<00:03:04.469> to<00:03:04.709> push<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.040> ball<00:03:05.159> out<00:03:05.219> of<00:03:05.370> my<00:03:05.459> feet

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
it just to push the ball out of my feet

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.670 
it just to push the ball out of my feet
and<00:03:05.939> set<00:03:06.299> up<00:03:06.449> a<00:03:06.540> shot<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.019> my<00:03:07.139> second<00:03:07.500> touch

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and set up a shot with my second touch

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.709 
and set up a shot with my second touch
and<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.730> works<00:03:08.909> quite<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.209> lot<00:03:09.419> you're<00:03:09.569> just

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
and that works quite a lot you're just

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.000 
and that works quite a lot you're just
creating<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.079> initial<00:03:10.469> space<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.889> that<00:03:10.919> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
creating that initial space so that you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.559 
creating that initial space so that you
can<00:03:11.159> get<00:03:11.310> into<00:03:11.609> your<00:03:11.730> strident<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.389> hit<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
can get into your strident and hit the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.809 
can get into your strident and hit the
ball<00:03:12.719> and<00:03:12.870> gone<00:03:13.079> but<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.889> course<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:14.219> can<00:03:14.430> use

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
ball and gone but of course you can use

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.849 
ball and gone but of course you can use
this<00:03:15.060> technique<00:03:15.449> to<00:03:15.750> try<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.439> turn<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
this technique to try to turn the

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.009 
this technique to try to turn the
defender<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.549> one<00:03:17.939> complete<00:03:18.209> motion<00:03:18.689> so<00:03:18.900> as

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
defender in one complete motion so as

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.809 
defender in one complete motion so as
the<00:03:19.109> balls<00:03:19.319> coming<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.769> say<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.459> want<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.639> turn

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
the balls coming in say you want to turn

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.219 
the balls coming in say you want to turn
to<00:03:20.939> the<00:03:21.060> left<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.509> can<00:03:21.659> see<00:03:21.780> here<00:03:22.019> you

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
to the left like you can see here you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.839 
to the left like you can see here you
just<00:03:22.290> hold<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:22.709> trigger<00:03:23.069> push<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.579> stick<00:03:23.759> in

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
just hold right trigger push to stick in

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.969 
just hold right trigger push to stick in
that<00:03:23.970> direction<00:03:24.169> and<00:03:25.169> go<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> space<00:03:25.769> I

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
that direction and go for the space I

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.129 
that direction and go for the space I
mean<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.250> doesn't<00:03:26.579> work<00:03:26.849> all<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.449> time<00:03:27.780> and

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
mean that doesn't work all the time and

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.330 
mean that doesn't work all the time and
I'll<00:03:28.319> see<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.530> wouldn't<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.769> fair<00:03:28.919> if<00:03:28.979> it<00:03:29.129> did

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
I'll see it wouldn't be fair if it did

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.610 
I'll see it wouldn't be fair if it did
but<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.150> find<00:03:30.479> that<00:03:30.569> we<00:03:30.750> move<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.139> first<00:03:31.379> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
but I do find that we move the first the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.719 
but I do find that we move the first the
method<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:31.949> mentioned<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.340> getting<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.579> ball

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
method I mentioned of getting the ball

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.099 
method I mentioned of getting the ball
out<00:03:32.759> of<00:03:32.849> your<00:03:33.000> feet<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.329> making<00:03:33.479> space<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:33.870> a

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
out of your feet and making space for a

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.960 
out of your feet and making space for a
shot<00:03:34.379> or<00:03:34.470> even<00:03:34.650> past<00:03:34.829> can<00:03:35.639> be<00:03:35.759> really

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
shot or even past can be really

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.369 
shot or even past can be really
effective<00:03:36.030> you've<00:03:36.720> got<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.079> timing

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
effective you've got to get the timing

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.749 
effective you've got to get the timing
right<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.889> because<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.430> seems<00:03:38.699> like

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
right on this because it seems like

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.649 
right on this because it seems like
there's<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> very<00:03:39.060> small<00:03:39.299> window<00:03:39.449> of

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
there's a very small window of

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.360 
there's a very small window of
opportunity<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.229> actually<00:03:40.560> hold<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.220> right

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
opportunity to actually hold the right

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.860 
opportunity to actually hold the right
trigger<00:03:41.400> down<00:03:41.729> and<00:03:41.970> flip<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> right<00:03:42.329> day<00:03:42.509> yeah

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
trigger down and flip the right day yeah

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.330 
trigger down and flip the right day yeah
I'm<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.229> I'm<00:03:43.319> holding<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.739> right<00:03:43.859> trigger<00:03:44.099> as

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
I'm so I'm holding the right trigger as

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.679 
I'm so I'm holding the right trigger as
the<00:03:44.459> board<00:03:44.639> is<00:03:44.729> coming<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.299> as

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
the board is coming in and then just as
