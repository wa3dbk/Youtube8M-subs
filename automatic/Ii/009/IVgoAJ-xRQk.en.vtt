about 18 centimeters which did the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
about 18 centimeters which did the
conversion<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.250> six<00:00:32.550> inches<00:00:32.910> something

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.500> which<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.710> Tokyo<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:36.300> pretty

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630

like that which for Tokyo it's pretty
crazy<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.320> last<00:00:37.590> year<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
crazy and like last year I think the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.790 
crazy and like last year I think the
most<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.360> got<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.620> stuck<00:00:41.040> was

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
most we got that actually stuck was

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
most we got that actually stuck was
maybe<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.600> six<00:00:45.600> centimeters<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:48.090> inches<00:00:48.120> or

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
maybe like six centimeters to inches or

00:00:48.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
maybe like six centimeters to inches or
something<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> fair<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> only

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
something to be fair this is the only

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.139 
something to be fair this is the only
place<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
place we can really go right now like it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
place we can really go right now like it
would<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> hell<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> trek<00:01:04.049> through<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
would be a hell of a trek through the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.679 
would be a hell of a trek through the
snow<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.610> anyplace<00:01:05.939> else<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.540> can

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
snow to get anyplace else and you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.890 
snow to get anyplace else and you can
tell<00:01:06.900> these<00:01:07.710> bicycles<00:01:08.330> these<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.479> employees

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
tell these bicycles these are employees

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:36.179 
tell these bicycles these are employees
bicycle
