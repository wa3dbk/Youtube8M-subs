00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.200
Hi Everyone! Kristina here. Welcome to Day
18 of the Holiday Card Series for 2014. Today

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.840
I'm using the Deck the Halls stamp set from
Lawn Fawn. This is a great builder stamp set.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.120
There's lots of fun pine needles and pine
cones, berries and thing like that. So I thought

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.390
I would create my own wreath. So I needed
a circular shape to use to add a penciled

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.600
circle onto my cardstock here. I just used
the top of a spray can and I just traced it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.879
with my pencil. Now I have circular shape
to use for my wreath. I'm starting out with

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.989
Simon Says Stamp Dark Chocolate ink. I'm going
to be stamping the pine cones first. I wanted

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.570
to stamp these because they're going to not
have very much overlap with the pine cones

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.930
and things like that. So, I wanted to make
sure that these are stamped first. I stamped

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
three of them. Just because three is an odd
number and always looks nice. Now, I'm going

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.580
to go in with some Forever Green ink from
Hero Arts. I'm taking one of the pine needles,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.100
little sprigs of pine needles, and you'll
notice that as I stamp this I'm making sure

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.970
that the pine needles are sort of facing in
a clockwise motion, meaning that the stems

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.020
are always to the right. I'm doing this because
if you look at a wreath, they all kind of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.810
have a path that it runs. It either runs clockwise
or counter clockwise. I want to make sure

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.880
that all of the pine needles go in the same
direction. I'm adding all of these in Forever

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.710
Green. Now, I'm using one of the other smaller
pine needle stamps with Green Apple ink from

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.310
Simon Says Stamp. I'm going to fill in the
rest of this wreath here. For the most part,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.130
what I discovered is that I first had one
of them pointing up and then I had another

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.450
one pointing down. As long as I have that
then it started to fill out the rest of the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.920
wreath. You'll notice here I have one going
that direction and then I'll have another

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.640
going the other direction. One going into
the circle and then one going out of the circle.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.599
As long as I sort of kept that same pattern
it made sure that the wreath was nice and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.599
full and I didn't have any gaps. So, the darker
green pine needle also goes for that. I made

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.980
sure that I covered up its stem with a lighter
green. Then I took the little berry stamp.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.549
It's just this little itty bitty stamp that
has three dots on it and I'm using some Lipstick

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.700
Red ink from Simon Says Stamp and I'm just
adding these little berries to different areas

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.060
on the wreath. If you have areas that are
kind of blank and they need something there

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.670
putting the berries there is a really good
option. I'm just filling in some areas with

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.290
those berries. This really fills out the wreath
and makes sure it fills complete and then

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.370
I am going to be heat setting this. Mostly
because I'm going to be embossing over the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.650
top and I don't want any embossing powder
sticking to any of the ink that's not completely

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.040
dry. These particular types of ink that I
used here does dry to the touch rather quickly

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.579
and it's not going to smudge, but some of
that moisture sort of stays behind so I wanted

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.900
to make sure that it was completely dry. I
erased my pencil circle with an eraser. Now

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.029
I'm going to take the Deck the Halls greeting
from that stamp set and I'm stamping it in

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:42.980
VersaMark ink right over the center of this
wreath. I'm going to be using some Metallic Gold embossing

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.809
powder. I just thought it would look really
elegant and really nice over the center of

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:52.590
this wreath. The embossing powder that I'm
using today is from WOW Embossing Powders.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.159
This is Rich Pale Gold. I really love this
gold embossing powder in particular because

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:06.159
it really smoothes out. Once it's melted it
has a really smooth surface and texture. Some

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.939
gold powders that I've had in the past have
a gritty texture. I'm not entirely sure why.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.049
But when I found this embossing powder I really
fell in love with it, because it's such a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.360
nice embossing powder. It's nice and smooth.
I just heat set that until it was melted and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.360
then I trimmed it down so it was about 3.75x3.75
square. The cardstock I'm using today for

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.970
the card base is Lipstick Red. It's that same
red...or actually. I'm sorry. This is Schoolhouse

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.970
Red from Simon Says Stamp. It's a little bit
of a deeper red. This is going to be a 4.25

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.280
square card. So that's how it looks. I'm also
going to be adding some gold around the outside

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.280
edge of the card. So I'm opening the card
and I'm going to be kind of pressing the edges

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.530
of the card into this VersaMark pad. So, I'm
holding it at a little bit of an angle. Making

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.250
sure that I get a little bit more VersaMark
on the edges. If you wanted a very even edge

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.910
and made sure that everything was exact width
you could hold your cardstock straight up,

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.220
but I didn't want any of that VersaMark on
the back of the card. So I decided to hold

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.110
it at an angle. So now I'm applying that same
gold embossing powder. I'm going to be able

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.990
to use a brush to brush off any areas where
the embossing powder is sticking, so I'm not

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.820
worrying about it sticking at this point.
I'm just sprinkling it on and making sure

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.650
that it coats each area. So after I tapped
that off really really well, because it likes

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.530
to stick, I took a flat brush. This is a dry
brush and I just brushed away some of that

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.750
embossing powder. Some areas just a little
bit too thick for my liking so I just narrowed

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.370
them down a little bit. Then I melted that
with my heat gun. It gives it a really nice

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.860
gold edge. It's almost like it's been painted
with gold ink. I think its super super pretty.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.620
I took my wreath piece and put it on some
foam adhesive and then put that directly onto

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.470
this card front here. I want to make sure
that it's completely centered so I am going

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.090
to take my time getting that centered before
I really press down and use my fingertips

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.930
to really adhere that down onto the card base.
So that is the card for today. This is super

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.240
simple and easy. I really think you could
mass produce this card over and over again

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.440
without much trouble. Just make sure you do
each step in batches. Like stamp all your

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.760
pine cones on all 10 pieces of cardstock all
at once and then stamp all your pine needles.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Do everything in batches and I think you could
make a lot of this card. So I hope you guys

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.440
enjoyed. I will be back on Monday with a brand
new card video. It will be Day 19 in the card

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.540
