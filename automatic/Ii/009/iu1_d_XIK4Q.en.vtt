00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
bit you can just tell by the large stump
right<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.880> weight<00:01:42.150> behind

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
right there that there is weight behind

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
right there that there is weight behind
it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.130 
it
just<00:01:43.409> remove<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.860> plastic<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.240> check<00:01:45.990> out

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
just remove the plastic and check out

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
just remove the plastic and check out
the<00:01:46.320> electric<00:01:46.710> scooter<00:01:47.009> besides<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> first

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the electric scooter besides the first

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.700 
the electric scooter besides the first
impression<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.380> heavy

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
impression of it being pretty heavy

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
impression of it being pretty heavy
the<00:01:49.920> second<00:01:50.250> impression<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> thought<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the second impression is I thought it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.499 
the second impression is I thought it
would<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> longer<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.369> short<00:01:53.700> now

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
would be longer it is pretty short now

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
would be longer it is pretty short now

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
outside and write it for the first time

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
outside and write it for the first time
and<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.200> happens<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.549> my
