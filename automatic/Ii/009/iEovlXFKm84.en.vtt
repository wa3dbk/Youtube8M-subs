00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
so we at the freescale technology forum

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.110 
so we at the freescale technology forum
here<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.689> Orlando<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.549> you're<00:00:05.549> showing<00:00:05.940> a

processors<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.789> really<00:01:20.969> make<00:01:21.179> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
processors that will really make the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.209 
processors that will really make the
snap<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.319> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.679> cortex<00:01:23.069> a8

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
snap right now this is the cortex a8

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.760 
snap right now this is the cortex a8
processor<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.539> when<00:01:24.929> cortex<00:01:25.229> a9<00:01:25.530> comes

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
processor but when cortex a9 comes

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
processor but when cortex a9 comes
around<00:01:26.039> you'll<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.459> see<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:26.819> snap<00:01:27.090> like

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
around you'll really see these snap like

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
around you'll really see these snap like
this<00:01:27.719> very<00:01:28.560> quick<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:28.979> fast<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.549> how<00:01:29.640> about

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this very quick very fast but how about

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
this very quick very fast but how about
their<00:01:30.000> quote<00:01:30.270> thanks<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> eight<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.350> say<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
their quote thanks to eight you say it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
their quote thanks to eight you say it's
going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.069> fast<00:01:32.280> enough<00:01:32.399> for<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.969> whole

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
going to be fast enough for a whole

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.929 
going to be fast enough for a whole
range<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.170> consumers<00:01:34.709> oh<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.069> you<00:01:35.399> yeah<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
range of consumers oh you you yeah I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
range of consumers oh you you yeah I
think<00:01:36.060> we're<00:01:36.299> gonna<00:01:36.390> say<00:01:36.569> he'll<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.899> very<00:01:37.049> fast

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
think we're gonna say he'll be very fast

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.849 
think we're gonna say he'll be very fast
so<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.609> think<00:01:39.479> most<00:01:39.750> believe<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> cortex<00:01:40.590> a9

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
so I think most believe that cortex a9

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:41.949 
so I think most believe that cortex a9
is<00:01:41.069> really<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.399> they<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.909> with

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
is really what they want to go out with

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.109 
is really what they want to go out with
that's<00:01:42.959> the<00:01:43.109> multi-core<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.609> really<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that's the multi-core and really you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
that's the multi-core and really you
know<00:01:45.259> faster<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.289> owe<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.399> things<00:01:47.549> we

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
know faster I owe a lot of things we

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
know faster I owe a lot of things we
learn<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.390> processors<00:01:48.929> they<00:01:49.110> were

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
learn from these processors they were

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.399 
learn from these processors they were
you<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:51.060> designed<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.259> not

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you know they were designed well but not

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.789 
you know they were designed well but not
really<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.819> netbook<00:01:54.509> type

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
really for you know netbook type

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
really for you know netbook type
processing<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.459> now<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:57.149> eight<00:01:57.390> they've

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
processing so now with eight they've

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.330 
processing so now with eight they've
kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> learned<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.379> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> lessons<00:01:58.739> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
kind of learned a lot of lessons and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.660 
kind of learned a lot of lessons and
have<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.319> processor<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
have all that in the processor so you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
have all that in the processor so you
work<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.149> canonical<00:02:03.689> yes<00:02:03.989> so<00:02:04.379> you<00:02:04.439> actually

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
work at canonical yes so you actually

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.300 
work at canonical yes so you actually
see<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.840> prototypes<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.409> totally<00:02:07.799> top-secret

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
see the prototypes is totally top-secret

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.690 
see the prototypes is totally top-secret
prototype<00:02:08.670> yes<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.450> xe9<00:02:10.069> super<00:02:11.069> designs<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
prototype yes I xe9 super designs and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.699 
prototype yes I xe9 super designs and
it's<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.030> amazing<00:02:12.239> though<00:02:12.540> yes<00:02:12.900> no<00:02:13.260> Superman

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it's just amazing though yes no Superman

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.860 
it's just amazing though yes no Superman
is<00:02:13.829> up<00:02:13.980> come<00:02:14.160> around<00:02:14.400> no<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> lot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
is up come around no you like it a lot

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.220 
is up come around no you like it a lot
and<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:18.389> here<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.690> explain<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.049> little

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and so right here can explain a little

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.559 
and so right here can explain a little
bit<00:02:19.380> since<00:02:20.190> 10<00:02:20.819> 4<00:02:21.060> 9<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.750> 10

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
bit since 10 4 9 for 10

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.229 
bit since 10 4 9 for 10
unarmed<00:02:23.290> okay<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.040> has<00:02:24.129> happened<00:02:24.609> between

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
unarmed okay that has happened between

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.170 
unarmed okay that has happened between
1910<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:25.900> 10.4<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.069> with<00:02:27.340> 10.4<00:02:27.969> that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
1910 and 10.4 so with 10.4 that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.000 
1910 and 10.4 so with 10.4 that
specifically<00:02:28.689> it's<00:02:29.109> actually<00:02:29.319> optimized<00:02:29.920> for

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
specifically it's actually optimized for

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160 
specifically it's actually optimized for
armed<00:02:30.280> g7<00:02:30.819> now<00:02:30.969> so<00:02:31.480> taking<00:02:31.749> advantage<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.079> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
armed g7 now so taking advantage of a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.379 
armed g7 now so taking advantage of a
lot<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.469> arm<00:02:32.620> v7<00:02:32.829> instruction<00:02:33.549> set<00:02:33.760> that

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
lot of the arm v7 instruction set that

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.780 
lot of the arm v7 instruction set that
will<00:02:35.139> be<00:02:35.230> used<00:02:35.379> actually<00:02:35.950> what<00:02:36.609> we're<00:02:36.700> going

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
will be used actually what we're going

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.000 
will be used actually what we're going
to<00:02:36.879> have<00:02:36.939> here<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.540> another<00:02:38.079> version<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
to have here is another version it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.559 
to have here is another version it's
seven<00:02:39.790> dollar<00:02:39.969> 4<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.510> 7<00:02:41.310> 710<00:02:42.389> that<00:02:43.389> will<00:02:43.480> become

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
seven dollar 4 of 7 710 that will become

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.270 
seven dollar 4 of 7 710 that will become
around<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.019> there<00:02:44.739> is<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.829> different<00:02:45.159> arm

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
around so there is a different arm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.449 
around so there is a different arm
version<00:02:45.670> coming<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.510> boon<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.920> mean

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
version coming of a boon to but you mean

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.729 
version coming of a boon to but you mean
seven<00:02:48.849> depends<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.480> guess<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:49.840> 1004<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.650> have

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
seven depends you guess so 1004 you have

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.659 
seven depends you guess so 1004 you have
1004<00:02:51.159> for<00:02:51.430> x86<00:02:51.730> 1004<00:02:52.569> yeah<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.409> arm<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.459> going

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
1004 for x86 1004 yeah but arm is going

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.349 
1004 for x86 1004 yeah but arm is going
to<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.969> a<00:02:55.859> 10-10<00:02:56.859> dot<00:02:57.040> 710<00:02:57.879> that's<00:02:58.090> seven

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
to have a 10-10 dot 710 that's seven

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.479 
to have a 10-10 dot 710 that's seven
personally<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.870> July<00:02:59.169> yeah<00:02:59.680> July<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
personally in July yeah July is going to

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.089 
personally in July yeah July is going to
be<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:02.109> this<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.379> 0<00:03:02.469> at<00:03:02.769> 44<00:03:03.549> or<00:03:04.090> x86<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.949> can

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
be so this is 0 at 44 or x86 and you can

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.309 
be so this is 0 at 44 or x86 and you can
see<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.459> 1004<00:03:06.939> but<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.689> ARM<00:03:07.900> version<00:03:07.989> is

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
see a lot of 1004 but the ARM version is

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.110 
see a lot of 1004 but the ARM version is
going<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:08.500> come<00:03:08.620> out<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.919> like<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.000> know<00:03:10.030> a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
going to come out and like you know a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.869 
going to come out and like you know a
little<00:03:10.299> bit<00:03:10.419> after<00:03:10.659> so<00:03:11.049> that's<00:03:11.260> 7<00:03:11.590> 10<00:03:11.949> dot<00:03:12.129> 707

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
little bit after so that's 7 10 dot 707

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.699 
little bit after so that's 7 10 dot 707
so<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.419> netbook<00:03:13.930> edition<00:03:14.219> optimized<00:03:15.219> for

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
so this is netbook edition optimized for

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.979 
so this is netbook edition optimized for
like<00:03:17.709> 2d<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.459> 2d<00:03:18.969> version<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.419> so<00:03:19.780> yeah

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
like 2d the 2d version of that so yeah

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.470 
like 2d the 2d version of that so yeah
fast<00:03:20.349> nappy<00:03:20.859> yeah<00:03:21.280> how<00:03:21.489> about<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.909> RAM<00:03:22.269> how

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
fast nappy yeah how about the RAM how

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.929 
fast nappy yeah how about the RAM how
much<00:03:22.629> RAM<00:03:22.900> would<00:03:23.139> you<00:03:23.260> recommend<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.760> has

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
much RAM would you recommend so this has

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.210 
much RAM would you recommend so this has
only<00:03:25.090> 512<00:03:25.840> Meg's<00:03:26.049> right<00:03:26.469> here<00:03:26.680> yeah<00:03:26.889> about<00:03:27.069> it

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
only 512 Meg's right here yeah about it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.339 
only 512 Meg's right here yeah about it
so<00:03:27.400> one<00:03:27.549> gigahertz<00:03:27.819> part<00:03:28.389> definitely

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
so one gigahertz part definitely

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.129 
so one gigahertz part definitely
recommend<00:03:29.949> they<00:03:30.250> dig<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:31.239> memory<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.989> this

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
recommend they dig a memory but this

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.050 
recommend they dig a memory but this
one's<00:03:32.319> really<00:03:32.650> really<00:03:32.979> well<00:03:33.129> with<00:03:33.340> only<00:03:33.430> 512

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
one's really really well with only 512

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.390 
one's really really well with only 512
max<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.900> actually<00:03:35.229> you<00:03:35.409> can<00:03:35.530> see<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:36.069> device

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
max and actually you can see this device

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.789 
max and actually you can see this device
here<00:03:36.989> you've<00:03:37.989> already<00:03:38.109> seen<00:03:38.379> you<00:03:38.590> probably

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
here you've already seen you probably

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.259 
here you've already seen you probably
seen<00:03:39.009> in<00:03:39.129> other<00:03:39.280> places<00:03:39.549> in<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.879> conference

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
seen in other places in the conference

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.929 
seen in other places in the conference
but<00:03:40.389> this<00:03:40.569> is<00:03:40.689> the<00:03:40.810> follow-on<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.280> sharp

browser palette or ram and processing

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.640 
browser palette or ram and processing
speed<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.330> see<00:04:30.450> chromium<00:04:30.870> loaded

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
speed so you can see chromium loaded

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.900 
speed so you can see chromium loaded
really<00:04:31.830> quick<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.520> connected

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
really quick and so that it connected

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.060 
really quick and so that it connected
that's<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.900> know<00:04:34.020> connects<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> web<00:04:34.860> so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
that's you know connects to the web so

that's<00:04:45.900> pretty<00:04:46.199> awesome<00:04:46.259> then<00:04:46.620> how<00:04:46.710> about<00:04:46.800> I

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
that's pretty awesome then how about I

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.040 
that's pretty awesome then how about I
makes<00:04:47.250> 53<00:04:47.759> are<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.060> last<00:04:48.599> thing<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.930> I've

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
makes 53 are you last thing that I've

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.779 
makes 53 are you last thing that I've
done<00:04:49.289> yes<00:04:49.680> so<00:04:50.069> I<00:04:50.099> think<00:04:50.220> that's<00:04:50.430> what<00:04:50.699> you're

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
done yes so I think that's what you're

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.120 
done yes so I think that's what you're
going<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.970> see<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.120> lot<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.449> folks<00:04:51.930> these<00:04:52.590> babies

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
going to see a lot of folks these babies

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.550 
going to see a lot of folks these babies
with<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.240> some<00:04:54.419> degrees<00:04:54.780> those<00:04:55.440> are

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
with I have some degrees those are

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.110 
with I have some degrees those are
definitely<00:04:55.680> going<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.009> be<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.430> bus<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.000> run

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
definitely going to be a bus and run

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.260 
definitely going to be a bus and run
faster<00:04:57.780> ram<00:04:57.930> multi-core<00:04:58.819> other<00:04:59.819> things<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.240> I

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
faster ram multi-core other things so I

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.939 
faster ram multi-core other things so I
think<00:05:00.389> we'll<00:05:01.080> see<00:05:01.289> a<00:05:01.319> lot<00:05:01.410> of<00:05:01.470> designs<00:05:01.800> with

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
think we'll see a lot of designs with

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.879 
think we'll see a lot of designs with
the<00:05:02.039> time<00:05:02.160> it's<00:05:02.310> 53<00:05:02.669> cool<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:04.410> if<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.650> can<00:05:04.770> see
