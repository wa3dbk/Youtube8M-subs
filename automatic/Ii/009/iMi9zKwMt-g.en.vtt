00:00:02.206 --> 00:00:03.347
- My name is Rob Grimm.

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:04.789
I am a commercial photographer

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:08.956
and I specialize in food,
beverage, and product photography.

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:13.841
I started out as a product photographer.

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.532
I was working in another photo studio.

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.096
That's where I apprenticed
and that was here in St. Louis

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.932
where I really kinda was
full time in one studio

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:22.488
and had a chance to dig in

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.576
and really apprentice in one place.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:26.051
And coming up through them

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:28.383
and being able to be
introduced to their clients,

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:30.124
that's where I got my
first taste, if you will,

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:31.791
of food photography.

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.444
The overall goal in
effective food photography

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:41.499
is to evoke appetite appeal in the viewer.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.458
Food is one of the most
photographed objects.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.848
Go down a grocery aisle.

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:49.852
You'll see thousands and
thousands and thousands of images.

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:53.583
We're selling food so we have
to make them feel hungry.

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.619
You instantly have to go (sharply exhales)

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.926
I want that, that looks good.

00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.376
So I think one of the greatest things

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:01.438
that a food photographer can do,

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:03.792
outside of having their equipment,

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.682
is understand that they
have to evoke emotion

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:09.023
in their viewer, so they
need to pick up some tools

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:11.558
and some props and some techniques

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:15.308
that are gonna convey
that to their audience.

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.412
Almost every art buyer, art director,

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:22.745
they almost all come

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.853
at "Wow, his stuff is bold and graphic."

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.698
At the same time, it
gives it appetite appeal.

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:31.388
It really kind of makes
people want to draw into it.

00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:33.293
So I think what I've been able to do

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:37.304
in my approach to the
food is kinda boil it down

00:01:37.304 --> 00:01:41.471
to a simplicity that really
makes the food heroic.

00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:45.891
My culinary skills have
gotten a lot better

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.040
since I've been shooting food photography

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.890
and I've had an opportunity

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.391
to be around some incredible chefs

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.710
and some incredible food
stylists who have mad skills

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.804
when it comes to working with food.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:58.021
So I've just always loved cooking.

00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.036
I love being in the kitchen.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.424
My approach, could that
be called obsessive?

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.635
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.689
I've definitely a perfectionist.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.814
I guess (laughs) I'm a little bit in tune

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:16.314
with the details, can you say?

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.736
I would absolutely describe myself

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.976
as a businessman and an artist.

00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:22.416
When I went off to college,

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:23.793
I went into the business school

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.482
and I spent a little time
in the business school

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:29.602
before actually shifting
gears and going to get my BFA.

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:33.011
So I did spend time kind of understanding

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.255
the foundations of business

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.655
and without question that has helped me

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.405
maintain presence in this market.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:41.744
I got into teaching recently.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.154
I've always done lecturing.

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:46.479
I've always had students
come through the studio

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.704
for, I don't know, 15 years.

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:49.753
They bring a class through,

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.277
I sit down with them for a couple hours

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:54.328
and talk to them about
what I do, how I do it,

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:57.388
how you can actually be
a professional artist.

00:02:57.388 --> 00:03:00.482
And I've always wanted
to kind of share that.

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.634
Just in the last couple
years I've started to change

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.485
what I was doing in terms
of just lecturing students

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:06.353
and going out and actually doing workshops

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:10.520
and working on a much
broader, educational platform.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:14.721
My dad was an artist and an art teacher.

00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:19.149
He was a ceramicist, a
jewelry maker, a photographer.

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.409
I mean, growing up with him was amazing.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.810
In fact, some of my earliest memories,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.961
which are some of my
most formative memories,

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.863
I was probably five years old

00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:30.066
sitting on my dad's lap
at the potter's wheel.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.124
And he's running the pedal
on the potter's wheel,

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:33.344
had one hand around my waist

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:35.524
and the other helping me make a pot.

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:36.690
It was very cool.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.433
Great way to grow up.

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:40.718
I have never met a student of
his, former student of his,

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.215
who didn't say that my father

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:44.850
had a huge impact on them personally.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.615
And he had thousands of students.

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:51.466
That's really a rewarding thing
to hear about your father.

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:54.463
And I think that just coming
from a line of teachers,

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.003
I have had a grandmother
that was a teacher,

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.611
a great-grandfather that
was a teacher, a father,

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:02.425
there's a lineage of
education in my family.

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:04.350
So now, I've got the bug.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.097
And I very much feel my father

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:08.617
kinda channeling through me and I love it.

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:11.950
