in<00:00:04.430> the<00:00:04.670> previous<00:00:05.150> tutorial<00:00:05.779> we<00:00:05.810> taught<00:00:06.260> our

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
in the previous tutorial we taught our

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.549 
in the previous tutorial we taught our
robot<00:00:06.980> to<00:00:07.130> spin<00:00:07.520> around<00:00:07.640> like<00:00:08.000> this<00:00:08.450> but<00:00:09.410> we

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
robot to spin around like this but we

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.730 
robot to spin around like this but we
want<00:00:09.799> to<00:00:09.920> make<00:00:10.070> it<00:00:10.250> stop<00:00:10.670> and<00:00:10.969> to<00:00:11.900> press

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
want to make it stop and to press

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.709 
want to make it stop and to press
forward<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:13.460> push<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:13.880> toy<00:00:14.059> out<00:00:14.090> of<00:00:14.300> the<00:00:14.510> ring

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
forward and push the toy out of the ring

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.220 
forward and push the toy out of the ring
to<00:00:15.080> remind<00:00:15.800> you<00:00:16.369> what<00:00:16.849> our<00:00:17.060> program<00:00:17.599> does<00:00:17.630> we

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
to remind you what our program does we

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.849 
to remind you what our program does we
starts<00:00:18.740> here<00:00:19.310> at<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:19.760> green<00:00:20.600> triangle<00:00:21.020> it

choosing 4 which is less than in other
words<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:26.689> will<00:01:26.990> stop<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.159> less<00:01:28.460> than<00:01:28.640> a

words this will stop if it's less than a
certain<00:01:29.150> amount<00:01:29.680> put<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.860> 30<00:01:31.369> inches<00:01:31.880> which<00:01:32.150> is

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
certain amount put in 30 inches which is

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.999 
certain amount put in 30 inches which is
about<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.780> length<00:01:32.960> of<00:01:33.110> my<00:01:33.850> sumo<00:01:34.850> arena<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.009> so

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
about the length of my sumo arena and so

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.830 
about the length of my sumo arena and so
this<00:01:37.250> will<00:01:37.400> mean<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:38.810> happens<00:01:39.200> now<00:01:39.530> is

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
this will mean that what happens now is

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
thirty inches or 75 centimeters then it

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.710 
thirty inches or 75 centimeters then it
hops<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.489> loop<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.540> does

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
hops out of the loop and it does

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.100 
hops out of the loop and it does
whatever<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.379> after<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.629> we<00:02:22.629> don't<00:02:22.810> have

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
whatever is after this we don't have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.780 
whatever is after this we don't have
anything<00:02:23.379> after<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.370> let's<00:02:24.580> put

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
anything after this so let's put

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.089 
anything after this so let's put
something<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.390> or<00:02:26.260> get<00:02:26.470> rid<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
something in or get rid of the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.309 
something in or get rid of the
documentation<00:02:28.000> window<00:02:28.180> by<00:02:28.629> closing<00:02:29.019> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
documentation window by closing the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.720 
documentation window by closing the
content<00:02:29.799> editor<00:02:29.950> by<00:02:30.310> clicking<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.849> here<00:02:30.879> and

content editor by clicking up here and
we<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:34.090> use<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:35.410> move<00:02:35.709> tank<00:02:36.160> command<00:02:36.310> after

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
we can use the move tank command after

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.280 
we can use the move tank command after
this<00:02:38.730> since<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.970> will<00:02:40.209> theoretically<00:02:40.870> at

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
this since this will theoretically at

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.589 
this since this will theoretically at
least<00:02:41.560> if<00:02:41.860> everything<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.310> gone<00:02:42.519> right<00:02:42.790> be

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
least if everything is gone right be

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.420 
least if everything is gone right be
pointing<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.409> direction<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:45.099> our<00:02:45.670> toy

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
pointing in the direction of our toy

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.089 
pointing in the direction of our toy
when<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.579> sees<00:02:48.940> something<00:02:48.970> less<00:02:49.840> than<00:02:50.099> 30

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
when it sees something less than 30

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.580 
when it sees something less than 30
inches<00:02:51.400> 75<00:02:52.030> centimeters<00:02:52.540> it'll<00:02:53.049> go<00:02:53.200> straight

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
inches 75 centimeters it'll go straight

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.520 
inches 75 centimeters it'll go straight
towards<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.190> toy<00:02:54.660> at<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.750> moment<00:02:56.140> it'll<00:02:56.349> go

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
towards the toy at the moment it'll go

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.599 
towards the toy at the moment it'll go
one<00:02:56.829> rotation<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.609> speed<00:02:57.879> 50<00:02:58.359> speed<00:02:58.690> 50s<00:02:59.170> okay

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
one rotation of speed 50 speed 50s okay

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.069 
one rotation of speed 50 speed 50s okay
but<00:03:00.609> we'll<00:03:00.849> need<00:03:01.030> more<00:03:01.090> than<00:03:01.480> one<00:03:01.690> rotation

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
but we'll need more than one rotation

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.910 
but we'll need more than one rotation
because<00:03:02.799> that's<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.640> very<00:03:04.120> short<00:03:04.269> distance<00:03:04.989> in

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
because that's a very short distance in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.240 
because that's a very short distance in
the<00:03:06.160> case<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.579> my<00:03:07.480> particular<00:03:08.079> sumo<00:03:08.709> arena

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the case of my particular sumo arena

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.550 
the case of my particular sumo arena
I've<00:03:09.370> probably<00:03:09.609> put<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.090> st.<00:03:10.599> nine<00:03:10.840> rotations

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
I've probably put in st. nine rotations

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.960 
I've probably put in st. nine rotations
and<00:03:12.000> we'll<00:03:13.000> try<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.569> see<00:03:14.019> if<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.349> works

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
and we'll try and see if that works

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
and we'll try and see if that works
before<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.120> download<00:03:16.629> for<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.989> first<00:03:17.230> time<00:03:17.560> we

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
before we download for the first time we

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.750 
before we download for the first time we
just<00:03:17.980> check<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> couple<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.790> things<00:03:20.579> motors<00:03:21.579> are

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
just check a couple of things motors are

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.000 
just check a couple of things motors are
B<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.090> C<00:03:22.389> that's<00:03:22.810> okay<00:03:23.319> that's<00:03:23.709> where<00:03:23.889> they

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
B and C that's okay that's where they

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.750 
B and C that's okay that's where they
are<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> ayah<00:03:24.519> but<00:03:24.849> our<00:03:26.760> ultrasonic

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
are in the ayah but our ultrasonic

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.740 
are in the ayah but our ultrasonic
sensor<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.510> port<00:03:28.840> three<00:03:29.230> good<00:03:29.799> that's

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
sensor is in port three good that's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.750 
sensor is in port three good that's
where<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.139> if<00:03:32.560> we<00:03:32.769> wanted<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.220> correct<00:03:33.519> that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
where it is if we wanted to correct that

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.050 
where it is if we wanted to correct that
we've<00:03:34.000> got<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:35.250> click<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.370> three<00:03:36.760> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
we've got that we click in three and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.970 
we've got that we click in three and
that's<00:03:37.299> where<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.630> will<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.980> looks

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that's where it will be and we looks

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.610 
that's where it will be and we looks
okay<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:42.790> we'll<00:03:43.030> download<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.989> yayabot

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.559 

learning<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:50.939> excellent<00:03:51.939> pushes<00:03:52.450> it

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
learning all excellent pushes it

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.560 
learning all excellent pushes it
straight<00:03:52.930> out<00:03:52.959> good<00:03:53.379> work
