00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello electric guys that such 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.770
 welcome to a new video that by 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 popular request has brought you to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 help them and explain how to get a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.290
 body 10 in case you are 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.969
 vegetarian or vegan is to say that no 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.080
 you can include any animal feed in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.059
 your diet in the case of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 vegetarian or no food that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 comes from animals in the case of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.090
 Vegans such as the dairy 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.550
 eggs and so on clear this concept yes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.550
 you seem to start this new video 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 it is true that if we focus on the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 fitness world one person eyelash 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.030
 the vegan is much more limited than 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.920
 a person who is not by a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 partnership action because you can not access 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 to all types of proteins, especially 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 proteins of animal origin therefore in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 this case we will have to replace the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.150
 proteins of animal origin by proteins 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.589
 of vegetable origin there are excellent 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.449
 proteins of vegetable origin and I'll tell you 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.180
 which is a little bit later on without 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.010
 However, these will never become the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 same quality as proteins that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.079
 come for example from meat the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.729
 fish or eggs and if we apply it to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.519
 the diet of an athlete this what 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.409
 would limit quite a bit at the time of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.510
 muscle development since an athlete 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.940
 requires a quantity of proteins and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.369
 amino acids much greater than that of a 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.020
 person who does not exercise 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.830
 usual way since process of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.810
 Musculation is a continuous process 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.549
 tissue destruction and regeneration 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650
 muscle so without these proteins 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.119
 of a high biological value will be much 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.580
 harder to get an increase 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.490
 considerable of our muscle mass 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.280
 so a vegetarian and a vegan yes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.979
 that can go for a body 10 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.170
 first they will have to combine 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 masterfully food for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.119
 get the full chain of 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.030
 essential amino acids because of another 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.520
 way would be practically impossible and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 for this the person requires some 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.619
 very high notions of nutrition that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.180
 I imagine that it will not be the case of many of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.770
 you who are seeing right now this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 video but do not worry at all 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 because then I'm going to put the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.490
 solution on a tray that as you know 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 I build you absolutely for 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.110
 everything and second until the idea that the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.420
 development of muscle growth 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.070
 will be nothing like a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.110
 person that in this case is not 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.420
 vegetarian or ghana but do not 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.269
 worry because I'm going to give you the formula 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.360
 so that you get as close as possible to 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.130
 a body 10 looks though another you believe 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
 found this is the first supplement 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.700
 sports for vegetarians and vegans 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.519
 that combines the best sources of 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.140
 100% vegetable protein is called 100% in 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.150

 essential and non- essential amino acids 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.430
 that otherwise being vegetarian 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.470
 Vegan is practically impossible 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 get with almost 2 kilos of protein 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.069

 vegans has gone up 10% and I did not 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.799
 I would miss absolutely nothing because 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.590
 it is almost impossible to be at the same level 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.530
