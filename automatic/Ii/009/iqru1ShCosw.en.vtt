speed<00:00:13.110> boost<00:00:13.440> at<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.130> cost<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> grip<00:00:14.820> so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
speed boost at the cost of grip so

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.700 
speed boost at the cost of grip so
pretty<00:00:15.269> much<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.480> ISIL<00:00:15.990> has<00:00:16.109> done<00:00:16.260> loss<00:00:16.470> out

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
pretty much what ISIL has done loss out

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.269 
pretty much what ISIL has done loss out
of<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.210> 210<00:00:19.170> miles<00:00:19.410> an<00:00:19.619> hour<00:00:19.740> three

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of it way to it 210 miles an hour three

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
of it way to it 210 miles an hour three
times<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.000> complete<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> lap<00:00:21.689> under<00:00:22.160> 128<00:00:24.439> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
times and complete the lap under 128 so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.429 
times and complete the lap under 128 so
losing<00:00:25.769> grip<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> shot<00:00:26.640> speed<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
losing grip but it shot speed so out of

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:39.740 
losing grip but it shot speed so out of
those<00:00:28.800> five<00:00:29.189> times<00:00:29.609> did<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> previously<00:00:38.750> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
those five times did it previously the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
those five times did it previously the
often<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> free<00:00:40.469> fast<00:00:40.680> ones<00:00:41.129> long<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.120> 128

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
often with a free fast ones long so 128

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
often with a free fast ones long so 128
so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> only<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.500> scraped<00:00:43.800> through<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.129> on

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so I only just scraped through that on

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.680 
so I only just scraped through that on
the<00:00:44.579> last<00:00:45.059> hole<00:00:45.390> by<00:00:45.600> 127<00:00:46.940> whatever<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:50.219> same

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the last hole by 127 whatever that same

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.139 
the last hole by 127 whatever that same
track<00:00:51.690> again<00:00:51.989> grips<00:00:52.440> reduce<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> I'm

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
track again grips reduce but I do I'm

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.369 
track again grips reduce but I do I'm
not<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.110> around<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
not actually really going around a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.180 
not actually really going around a
corner<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:55.739> fast<00:00:56.100> anyway<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> far<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
corner is very fast anyway so far and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.580 
corner is very fast anyway so far and
pretty<00:01:03.030> cool<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.229> one

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.800 

left<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.250> brain<00:01:13.520> -<00:01:13.760> really<00:01:14.270> really<00:01:14.480> really

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
left the brain - really really really

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.320 
left the brain - really really really
really<00:01:15.790> really<00:01:16.790> really<00:01:17.360> light<00:01:18.080> there<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:20.150> get

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
really really really light there to get

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.190 
really really really light there to get
that<00:01:20.390> first<00:01:20.780> one<00:01:21.140> out<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.280> way<00:01:23.200> this

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
that first one out of the way this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:33.149 
that first one out of the way this
should<00:01:24.470> be<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.860> second<00:01:25.280> one

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.340 

so<00:01:33.670> I'm<00:01:33.790> really<00:01:34.120> really<00:01:34.300> slow<00:01:34.870> around<00:01:34.900> these

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
so I'm really really slow around these

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:47.140 
so I'm really really slow around these
corners<00:01:35.680> I'm<00:01:36.240> slow<00:01:37.240> rounded<00:01:37.540> corners<00:01:37.870> anyway

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.109 

my<00:01:48.150> tops<00:01:48.420> both<00:01:48.720> encouraged<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> bit

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:09.130 

my<00:01:52.390> hope<00:01:52.630> village<00:01:52.990> will<00:01:53.109> be<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.380> third<00:01:53.679> one

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.280 

now<00:02:09.680> that<00:02:09.860> time<00:02:10.160> was<00:02:10.430> I'm<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.600> sure<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
now that time was I'm not sure on a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.100 
now that time was I'm not sure on a
dirty

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.480 

I<00:02:23.140> don't<00:02:23.380> know<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:23.740> be<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> slower

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
I don't know if this would be a slower

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.140 
I don't know if this would be a slower
Natomas<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:25.420> more<00:02:26.130> fabien<00:02:27.130> around<00:02:27.580> about<00:02:27.820> us<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
Natomas or more fabien around about us I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.830 
Natomas or more fabien around about us I
quote<00:02:28.450> much<00:02:28.690> anything<00:02:29.110> cool<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:30.600> your<00:02:31.600> backs

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
quote much anything cool like your backs

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.740 
quote much anything cool like your backs
much<00:02:32.050> faster<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.050> was<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.530> first

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
much faster I think that was the first

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.850 
much faster I think that was the first
strike<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.370> first<00:02:39.550> straight<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.770> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
strike the first straight up to the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.790 
strike the first straight up to the
first<00:02:42.040> he<00:02:42.190> came<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.520> think<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.800> got

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
first he came I think that's where I got

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400 
first he came I think that's where I got
that<00:02:44.850> no<00:02:45.850> doubt<00:02:46.120> at<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> BT<00:02:46.630> Istanbul<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.350> I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
that no doubt at the BT Istanbul and I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.550 
that no doubt at the BT Istanbul and I
we<00:02:47.590> struggled<00:02:48.070> over<00:02:48.810> whilst<00:02:49.810> one<00:02:50.050> twenty<00:02:50.380> four

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
we struggled over whilst one twenty four

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.260 
we struggled over whilst one twenty four
point<00:02:50.770> nine<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.550> we've<00:02:51.700> moved<00:02:51.910> up<00:02:52.120> a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
point nine now so we've moved up a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.530 
point nine now so we've moved up a
little<00:02:52.390> bit<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.950> your<00:02:54.160> leaderboard<00:02:54.670> should

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
little bit so your leaderboard should

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.790 
little bit so your leaderboard should
reflect<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.200> other<00:02:59.320> people<00:02:59.650> have

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
reflect that at the other people have

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.949 
reflect that at the other people have
done<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:02.580> moves<00:03:03.580> now<00:03:03.880> squad<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.540> white<00:03:04.690> down

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
done that moves now squad and white down

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.290 
done that moves now squad and white down
anyway<00:03:05.320> so
