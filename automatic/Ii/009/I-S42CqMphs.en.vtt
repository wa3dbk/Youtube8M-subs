we're it's very high intense so what I
recommend<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:59.420> getting<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.579> blank<00:01:02.579> sheet<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
recommend is getting a blank sheet of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
recommend is getting a blank sheet of
paper<00:01:03.710> cutting<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> half<00:01:05.659> now<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.830> works

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
paper cutting it in half now this works

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
paper cutting it in half now this works

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
magically if you have only four tests

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
magically if you have only four tests
because<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> section<00:01:12.420> 1<00:01:12.900> 2<00:01:13.140> 3<00:01:13.729> 4<00:01:14.729> for

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because you have a section 1 2 3 4 for
