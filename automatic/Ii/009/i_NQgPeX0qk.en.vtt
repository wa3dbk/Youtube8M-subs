00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.229 
and it wears off so it's pretty obvious
if<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.050> have<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.320> take<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.800> if<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.910> look<00:02:38.090> at

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
if you have to take one if you look at

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.670 
if you have to take one if you look at
inside<00:02:38.810> but<00:02:39.560> an<00:02:39.680> outside<00:02:41.050> it's<00:02:42.050> probably<00:02:42.290> no

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
inside but an outside it's probably no

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.100 
inside but an outside it's probably no
difference<00:02:43.630> seriously<00:02:44.630> we<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.620> sleep

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
difference seriously we can sleep

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.040 
difference seriously we can sleep
only<00:02:48.110> say<00:02:48.740> it's<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:50.000> not<00:02:50.420> much<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.720> a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
only say it's that's not much of a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.460 
only say it's that's not much of a
difference<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.580> if<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.240> are<00:02:53.480> not<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.990> really

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
difference so if you are not a really

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.940 
difference so if you are not a really
diehard<00:02:54.950> menu<00:02:55.610> fan<00:02:55.819> in<00:02:55.970> your<00:02:56.000> pool<00:02:56.650> then<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
diehard menu fan in your pool then I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.320 
diehard menu fan in your pool then I
suggest<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.550> go<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:59.180> original<00:02:59.870> big<00:03:00.680> ones<00:03:00.920> and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
fan of manual go for the original ones

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.240 
fan of manual go for the original ones
okay<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.900> fake<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:12.260> cause<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.530> these<00:03:12.800> 90

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
okay and the fake one cause of these 90

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.840 
okay and the fake one cause of these 90
things<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:15.069> with<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.220> origin<00:03:16.580> one

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
things to this is with the origin one

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.960 
things to this is with the origin one
especially<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.110> same<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:19.220> unbelievable

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
especially the same it's unbelievable

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.210 
especially the same it's unbelievable
how<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.420> guys<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.590> believe<00:03:22.190> that

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
how you guys get this I believe that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.690 
how you guys get this I believe that
from<00:03:22.519> Sri<00:03:22.760> Lanka<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.540> fake<00:03:23.810> ones<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:25.400> this

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
from Sri Lanka of a fake ones and this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.940 
from Sri Lanka of a fake ones and this
is<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.940> real<00:03:26.090> one<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.660> fake<00:03:26.870> ones<00:03:27.080> the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
is the real one and the fake ones the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.100 
is the real one and the fake ones the
color<00:03:28.239> there<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.390> bit<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.900> color

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
color there is a bit of a color

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.040 
color there is a bit of a color
difference<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.800> real<00:03:31.610> one<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.390> bit<00:03:32.569> darker

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
difference a real one is a bit darker

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.199 
difference a real one is a bit darker
and<00:03:33.290> less<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.620> quantum<00:03:34.069> bit<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.760> that's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
and less a quantum bit like that that's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.259 
and less a quantum bit like that that's
about<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.540> hope<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.950> helps<00:03:37.010> don't<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.940> scan

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
about it hope this helps don't be scan

about it hope this helps don't be scan
if<00:03:38.569> someone<00:03:39.260> sells<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.190> something<00:03:40.640> like<00:03:40.790> this

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
if someone sells you something like this

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
for price like what 40 pounds do not buy

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.600 
for price like what 40 pounds do not buy
it<00:03:46.880> because<00:03:47.150> fake<00:03:48.019> one<00:03:48.230> only<00:03:48.530> costs<00:03:48.830> about<00:03:48.950> 10

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
it because fake one only costs about 10

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.990 
it because fake one only costs about 10
pounds<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.180> discuss<00:03:50.750> about<00:03:50.930> 40<00:03:51.410> pounds<00:03:52.000> so

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
pounds and discuss about 40 pounds so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.270 
pounds and discuss about 40 pounds so
that's<00:03:53.299> about<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.989> hope<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.070> video

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
that's about it and hope this video

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.590 
that's about it and hope this video
