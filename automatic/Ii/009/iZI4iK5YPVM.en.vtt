00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 99 weeks happened here is who tv today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.649
 it's on 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:20.310
 terrex advanced exercise for 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:22.500
 home first exercises difficult too 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.760
 Calling is a complex exercise one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 my dearest directly for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.390
 advanced because they are many 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 involve muscle groups and above all 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.759
 something really bad on the pump is what 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.700
 we do is we go with you 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.230
 But you should walk one foot in the bend 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.590
 you the bend on knee height 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.440
 we connect one 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 exclusive push up with a single 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.320
 Looks like this again for you 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 the note how do I get here now 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.030
 with the foot the ferry into the fabrics 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.280
 purely without knotting in the room that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 quite simple who right hand left foot 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 over cross 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 purely so also here I would sometimes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 imagine eight to twelve repetition 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 for the very tough guys also 15 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 as I said we do so halfway 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.900
 preppy with a push up and then comes 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.360
 an exclusive jump up a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.520
 a lot of muscle fibers and goes well 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.590
 on the pump I 'll do it once in front 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.180
 version before and once to the side with it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 you see what is important to us that we 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.509
 not in the hollow cross rush not in the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 stretched joint ends up taking me 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.250
 just let's go so I could 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.990
 make controlled 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.640
 a wine is in the air and helps the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 Musculature I'm giving it out of here though 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.979
 it's so nice deep into the hollow cross 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.369
 stand up front foot pressure on the heel 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 off up so if to do it with vip 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.320
 She wanted to catch her bodyweight on many 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.799
 nice but not in the stretched out 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.799
 directed 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.700
 So that was the boulder half with 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.159
 push up again to check on dealers 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 helps stretch the foot backwards 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.009
 surround the musculature whether nicos tight 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.560
 both are deep down in the back 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.800
 put pressure on the heel 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 upwards so front view and once 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.660
 The sides do not have sides 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.030
 put in the room again right hand 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.760
 left foot over cross 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 Just a once in a controlled way 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:36.390
 version hand comes close to the feet of one 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.440
 in the air helps surrounding muscles 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 not an acid push up here but 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.420
 robust legs parallel blue message 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.269
 up with far forward as possible 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.739
 exclusively press upwards 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.010
 controlled variant now with the 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.530
 Therapy captive body weight too 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 a lot of stretched elbow joint 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.370
 land easily but already wanted 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.590
 high voltage thus begin the nature 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
 kreuth rustles and also shoulder and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.370
 triceps stuck 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 Exercise number one terex advanced 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.290
 goes well on the bomb
