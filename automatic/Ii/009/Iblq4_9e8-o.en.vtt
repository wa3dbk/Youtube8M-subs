what<00:02:18.500> he<00:02:18.650> always<00:02:18.680> told<00:02:19.070> me<00:02:19.190> he<00:02:19.310> said<00:02:19.460> who<00:02:19.580> cares

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
what he always told me he said who cares

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.430 
what he always told me he said who cares
who<00:02:20.150> cares<00:02:20.360> they<00:02:20.630> don't<00:02:20.780> mean<00:02:20.960> anything<00:02:20.990> but

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
who cares they don't mean anything but

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
who cares they don't mean anything but
every<00:02:21.650> fourth<00:02:21.890> year<00:02:22.160> right<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.570> guess

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
every fourth year right so I guess

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.840 
every fourth year right so I guess
that's<00:02:24.140> approach<00:02:24.530> i'm<00:02:24.740> taking<00:02:25.100> i'm<00:02:25.340> going<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's approach i'm taking i'm going to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.020 
that's approach i'm taking i'm going to
take<00:02:25.970> his<00:02:26.120> approach<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.590> obviously

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
