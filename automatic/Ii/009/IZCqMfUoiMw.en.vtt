00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
whenever I bike after a rain I am like

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
whenever I bike after a rain I am like
keenly<00:00:28.470> aware<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> seeing<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.490> oil

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
keenly aware of seeing all the oil

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.720 
keenly aware of seeing all the oil
slicks<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.019> street<00:00:31.259> and<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.699> know

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
slicks on the street and as we know

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.290 
slicks on the street and as we know
storm<00:00:33.210> water<00:00:33.449> washes<00:00:34.199> all<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.650> that<00:00:35.059> into<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
storm water washes all of that into the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
storm water washes all of that into the
system<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.839> then<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.500> able<00:00:37.769> to<00:00:38.010> go

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
system and then if it's not able to go

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
system and then if it's not able to go
to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> treatment<00:00:38.550> plant<00:00:38.820> goes<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.330> out<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to the treatment plant goes right out to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.920 
to the treatment plant goes right out to
our<00:00:40.410> waterways<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.540> as<00:00:42.540> more<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.870> more

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
our waterways and as more and more

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.350 
our waterways and as more and more
people<00:00:43.140> come<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.769> live<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.339> because<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
people come and live here because it is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
people come and live here because it is
a<00:00:45.390> beautiful<00:00:45.570> place<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.290> it<00:00:46.559> becomes

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
a beautiful place I think it becomes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.200 
a beautiful place I think it becomes
more<00:00:46.979> and<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.159> important<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.000> take

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
more and more important that we take

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990 
more and more important that we take
steps<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.320> protect<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.040> great<00:00:50.489> environment

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
steps to protect this great environment

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.079 
steps to protect this great environment
that<00:00:51.150> we<00:00:51.269> have<00:00:52.220> about<00:00:53.220> two-thirds<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
that we have about two-thirds of the

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.030 
that we have about two-thirds of the
city<00:00:54.330> is<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.720> call<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> combined<00:00:55.530> sewer

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
city is what we call a combined sewer

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.579 
city is what we call a combined sewer
system<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:56.820> means<00:00:57.089> storm<00:00:57.989> water<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
system and that means storm water and

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.540 
system and that means storm water and
sewage<00:00:58.920> flow<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.790> same<00:01:00.119> pipe

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
sewage flow into the same pipe

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.580 
sewage flow into the same pipe
from<00:01:02.000> there<00:01:02.210> flow<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.989> treatment<00:01:03.379> plan

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
from there flow to the treatment plan

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.320 
from there flow to the treatment plan
for<00:01:03.980> treatment<00:01:04.370> that's<00:01:04.820> one<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.180> great

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
for treatment that's one of the great

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.810 
for treatment that's one of the great
things<00:01:05.690> about<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:06.050> combined<00:01:06.409> sewer<00:01:06.710> system<00:01:07.130> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
things about a combined sewer system the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.520 
things about a combined sewer system the
bad<00:01:08.030> thing<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.300> when<00:01:08.630> there's<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.900> large<00:01:09.140> storm

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
bad thing is when there's a large storm

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.380 
bad thing is when there's a large storm
event<00:01:09.890> there's<00:01:10.400> not<00:01:10.580> enough<00:01:10.790> room<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
event there's not enough room for the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.270 
event there's not enough room for the
sewage<00:01:11.750> or<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.170> storm<00:01:12.440> water<00:01:12.680> in<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.979> system

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
sewage or the storm water in the system

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.540 
sewage or the storm water in the system
and<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.000> spills<00:01:14.360> out<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:16.070> ship<00:01:16.310> canal

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
and so it spills out the ship canal

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.249 
and so it spills out the ship canal
water<00:01:16.790> quality<00:01:17.090> project<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.810> happening

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
water quality project is happening

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.130 
water quality project is happening
because<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.509> overflow<00:01:20.509> points<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
because the overflow points in the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.990 
because the overflow points in the
combined<00:01:21.530> sewer<00:01:21.800> system<00:01:22.280> along<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.790> ship

combined sewer system along the ship

doing<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.690> safe<00:01:59.929> mode<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.740> putting<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.369> in

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
doing it in a safe mode is putting it in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.910 
doing it in a safe mode is putting it in
air<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.850> be<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:02.119> forever<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.780> mean<00:02:03.710> we<00:02:03.890> can't

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
air so be there forever I mean we can't

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.100 
air so be there forever I mean we can't
really<00:02:04.700> go<00:02:04.880> into<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.360> district<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:05.989> was

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
really go into this district that was

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.669 
really go into this district that was
built<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.800> know<00:02:06.920> hundreds<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.700> years<00:02:07.940> ago<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
built you know hundreds of years ago and

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.199 
built you know hundreds of years ago and
separate<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.890> storminess<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.940> sewer

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
separate the storminess and the sewer

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.050 
separate the storminess and the sewer
waters<00:02:11.690> would<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.800> be<00:02:12.920> astronomical<00:02:13.730> costs

yet<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> facility<00:02:15.760> over<00:02:16.760> at<00:02:16.849> West

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
gets it at the right rate so all we're

and we need to do everything we can to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.910 
and we need to do everything we can to
