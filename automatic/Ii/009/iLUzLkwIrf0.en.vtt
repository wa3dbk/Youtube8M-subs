there<00:06:04.809> was<00:06:04.929> a<00:06:04.959> slight<00:06:05.259> spin<00:06:05.709> on<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.009> ice<00:06:06.159> so

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
there was a slight spin on the ice so

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.079 
there was a slight spin on the ice so
that<00:06:07.209> it's<00:06:07.990> going<00:06:08.469> to<00:06:08.619> be<00:06:08.740> an<00:06:09.429> under<00:06:09.580> rotated

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
uses the back inside edge right there

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.309

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
and it should be an outside edge so that

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.589

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
again is an edge call on the element and

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.419 
again is an edge call on the element and
it<00:06:19.779> has<00:06:20.019> to<00:06:20.259> receive<00:06:20.589> a<00:06:20.619> negative<00:06:20.889> grade<00:06:21.309> of
