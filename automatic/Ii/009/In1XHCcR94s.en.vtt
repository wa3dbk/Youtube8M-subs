will<00:00:50.770> up<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.300> 178<00:00:52.300> degree<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.380> it<00:00:53.500> will<00:00:53.620> be<00:00:53.739> very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
will up to 178 degree so it will be very

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.430 
will up to 178 degree so it will be very
very<00:00:54.130> wired<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:57.070> power<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.760> can<00:00:58.420> see<00:00:58.660> the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
very wired and the power you can see the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.900 
very wired and the power you can see the
power<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:01.059> battery<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.629> inside<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.680> pad<00:01:03.520> part

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
power the battery is inside the pad part

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.020 
power the battery is inside the pad part
so<00:01:04.660> the<00:01:04.839> power<00:01:05.050> could<00:01:05.290> be<00:01:05.530> about<00:01:06.250> nine<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:07.000> ten

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
so the power could be about nine to ten

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.870 
so the power could be about nine to ten
hours<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:08.350> will<00:01:08.440> be<00:01:08.500> very<00:01:08.800> doable<00:01:09.040> durable

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
hours it will be very doable durable

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.230 
hours it will be very doable durable
