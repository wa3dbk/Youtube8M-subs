this one has covered every single one of
them<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.890> think<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.640> found<00:00:29.910> every<00:00:30.390> single<00:00:30.660> biome

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
them I think I found every single biome

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.790 
them I think I found every single biome
or<00:00:31.470> every<00:00:32.099> single<00:00:32.309> new<00:00:32.489> biome<00:00:33.649> within<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
or every single new biome within that

let's teleport to the next one as you
can<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.320> megataiga<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> can

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
can see this is megataiga and you can

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
can see this is megataiga and you can
see<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> coordinates<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.229> getting

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
see by the coordinates it's getting

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.929 
see by the coordinates it's getting
close<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.520> thousand<00:01:17.939> thousand<00:01:18.950> yet<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
close to a thousand thousand yet but you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.359 
close to a thousand thousand yet but you
got<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.240> megataiga<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.530> always<00:01:22.799> nice

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
got some megataiga which is always nice

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
got some megataiga which is always nice
it's<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.509> large<00:01:24.810> megataiga<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's actually a large megataiga it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.359 
it's actually a large megataiga it
extends<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.400> beyond<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> thousand<00:01:29.009> thousand

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
extends way beyond the thousand thousand

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
extends way beyond the thousand thousand
but<00:01:29.729> part<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:31.170> part

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
but part of it you know or a good part

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.569 
but part of it you know or a good part
of<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> within<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.880> radius<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.750> yeah<00:01:34.650> all

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
within the thousand thousand uh well

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.460 
within the thousand thousand uh well
within<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.939> only<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.470> three

within it's actually only like three

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
within it's actually only like three
hundred<00:01:55.590> blocks<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.130> spawn<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.790> which

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hundred blocks from spawn or so which

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.520 
hundred blocks from spawn or so which
you<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.640> it's<00:01:59.640> whatever<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.409> you

you know it's it's whatever but if you
head<00:02:01.740> north<00:02:01.770> from<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.090> there's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
head north from this one there's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.910 
head north from this one there's
actually<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:05.000> sunflower<00:02:06.000> planes<00:02:06.920> right

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
actually a bit of sunflower planes right

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.309 
actually a bit of sunflower planes right
here<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.690> flour<00:02:10.020> planes

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
here as you can see some flour planes

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.310 
here as you can see some flour planes
then<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> got<00:02:11.039> some

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
then you got some

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.440 
then you got some
swamp<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.980> swamp<00:02:14.370> m<00:02:14.730> which<00:02:15.420> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
swamp and I think that swamp m which is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
yeah so you got Mesa Mesa plateau that a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.160 
yeah so you got Mesa Mesa plateau that a
desert<00:02:38.280> surrounding<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.750> there's<00:02:40.020> some

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
desert surrounding it now there's some

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
desert surrounding it now there's some
forest<00:02:40.740> hills<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.760> stuff<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.670> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
forest hills and stuff like that it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.470 
forest hills and stuff like that it
that's<00:02:45.390> pretty<00:02:45.510> cool<00:02:45.860> alright<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.330> see<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's pretty cool alright and see the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.660 
that's pretty cool alright and see the
coordinates<00:02:48.990> it's<00:02:49.230> pretty<00:02:49.830> well<00:02:50.100> close<00:02:50.460> to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
coordinates it's pretty well close to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.640 
coordinates it's pretty well close to
the<00:02:50.760> border<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.090> thousand<00:02:51.690> thousand<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:52.350> it's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the border of thousand thousand but it's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.270 
the border of thousand thousand but it's
within<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.970> meets<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.570> criteria<00:02:55.280> all

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
within it so it meets the criteria all

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.010 
within it so it meets the criteria all

really close to spawn it's like four

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.710 
really close to spawn it's like four
hundred<00:04:09.810> blocks<00:04:10.730> away<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.420> it's

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
hundred blocks away you know it's

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.290 
hundred blocks away you know it's
there's<00:04:13.650> more<00:04:13.950> deep<00:04:14.220> ocean<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.850> just<00:04:15.120> the

just a halt yeah there will be a

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.790 
just a halt yeah there will be a
overview<00:04:52.199> map<00:04:52.550> with<00:04:53.960> I'm<00:04:54.960> gonna<00:04:55.139> try<00:04:55.409> to<00:04:55.530> put<00:04:55.770> a

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
overview map with I'm gonna try to put a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950 
overview map with I'm gonna try to put a
map<00:04:56.039> legend<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.330> know<00:04:57.449> show<00:04:57.690> where<00:04:57.870> all

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
map legend to you know show where all

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.710 
map legend to you know show where all
the<00:04:58.080> different<00:04:58.849> biomes<00:04:59.849> are<00:05:00.860> but<00:05:02.180> I'm<00:05:03.180> not

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
the different biomes are but I'm not

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.450 
the different biomes are but I'm not
yeah<00:05:04.380> I'll<00:05:04.470> probably<00:05:04.740> do<00:05:05.069> that<00:05:06.349> yeah<00:05:07.349> so<00:05:07.710> seed

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
yeah I'll probably do that yeah so seed

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.600 
yeah I'll probably do that yeah so seed
is<00:05:08.639> in<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:10.199> description<00:05:10.319> it's<00:05:10.979> on<00:05:11.159> top<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
is in the description it's on top of the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.809 
is in the description it's on top of the
video<00:05:12.319> it'll<00:05:13.319> be<00:05:13.440> on<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.560> overlain<00:05:14.069> overview

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
video it'll be on the overlain overview

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.300 
video it'll be on the overlain overview
map<00:05:15.000> it'll<00:05:15.479> be<00:05:15.630> pretty<00:05:16.380> much<00:05:16.590> everywhere<00:05:16.919> so

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
map it'll be pretty much everywhere so

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.089 
map it'll be pretty much everywhere so
you<00:05:18.270> shouldn't<00:05:18.539> miss<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.050> yeah<00:05:19.889> I<00:05:19.919> think
