00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.320 

I'm<00:00:09.980> gonna<00:00:10.190> see<00:00:10.430> one<00:00:10.610> of<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.820> techniques<00:00:11.210> I

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
I'm gonna see one of the techniques I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.600 
I'm gonna see one of the techniques I
might<00:00:11.480> show<00:00:11.720> you<00:00:11.780> later<00:00:12.050> is<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.160> keep<00:00:13.310> the<00:00:13.430> rod

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
might show you later is to keep the rod

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.359 
might show you later is to keep the rod
tip<00:00:13.640> very<00:00:14.150> low<00:00:14.360> into<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:14.870> water<00:00:15.110> and<00:00:16.070> that's<00:00:16.160> a

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
tip very low into the water and that's a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.359 
tip very low into the water and that's a
technique<00:00:16.760> for<00:00:16.910> manipulating<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.689> fly<00:00:18.369> so

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
technique for manipulating the fly so

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.680 
technique for manipulating the fly so
that<00:00:19.520> might<00:00:19.700> fly<00:00:19.820> could<00:00:19.970> stay<00:00:20.390> under<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
that might fly could stay under the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.400 
that might fly could stay under the
surface

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
surface

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:41.200 
surface
anything<00:00:21.770> else<00:00:39.670> it's<00:00:40.670> gonna<00:00:40.789> blow<00:00:40.999> on<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
anything else it's gonna blow on the

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.479 
anything else it's gonna blow on the
line<00:00:41.499> but<00:00:42.499> if<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:42.710> keep<00:00:42.859> here<00:00:43.069> you<00:00:43.280> know<00:00:43.399> you

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
line but if you keep here you know you

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.149 
line but if you keep here you know you
can<00:00:43.699> cast<00:00:43.969> where<00:00:44.389> you<00:00:44.479> want<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.929> keep<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.979> rod

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
can cast where you want to keep it rod

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.209 
can cast where you want to keep it rod
tip<00:00:46.429> and<00:00:46.879> kind<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.210> me<00:00:47.299> in<00:00:47.359> the<00:00:47.420> water<00:00:48.100> then<00:00:49.100> you

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
tip and kind of me in the water then you

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.709 
tip and kind of me in the water then you
might<00:00:49.399> have<00:00:49.549> a<00:00:49.579> little<00:00:49.760> bit<00:00:49.909> of<00:00:50.030> drag<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.569> there

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
might have a little bit of drag in there

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.090 
might have a little bit of drag in there
perhaps<00:00:50.899> with<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.379> water<00:00:51.589> but<00:00:51.829> you're<00:00:51.920> not

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
perhaps with the water but you're not

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.259 
perhaps with the water but you're not
going<00:00:52.249> to<00:00:52.309> have<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.519> wind<00:00:52.729> blowing<00:00:52.850> in

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
going to have the wind blowing in

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.129 
going to have the wind blowing in
completely<00:00:53.719> out<00:00:57.249> a<00:00:58.539> lot<00:00:59.539> of<00:00:59.569> people<00:00:59.749> when<00:01:00.019> they

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
completely out a lot of people when they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.910 
completely out a lot of people when they
think<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.589> King<00:01:01.159> Cod<00:01:01.369> I<00:01:01.399> first<00:01:02.229> wanna<00:01:03.229> tell<00:01:03.499> ya

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
think of King Cod I first wanna tell ya

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.350 
think of King Cod I first wanna tell ya
there's<00:01:04.159> no<00:01:04.280> Brio<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.729> line<00:01:04.909> is<00:01:05.059> attached<00:01:05.330> to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
there's no Brio the line is attached to

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.420 
there's no Brio the line is attached to
the<00:01:05.659> tip<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:05.990> rod<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:06.590> like<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.250> you're

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
the tip of the rod there like so you're

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.300 
the tip of the rod there like so you're
just<00:01:07.640> tapping<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.830> way<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.100> kind<00:01:10.130> of

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
just tapping and in a way it kind of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.140 
just tapping and in a way it kind of
upsets<00:01:10.700> me<00:01:10.910> because<00:01:11.830> you're<00:01:12.830> casting<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.580> can

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
upsets me because you're casting I can

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.350 
upsets me because you're casting I can
guess<00:01:14.360> pretty<00:01:14.720> much<00:01:14.840> anywhere<00:01:15.200> at<00:01:15.350> lunch

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
guess pretty much anywhere at lunch

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.700 
guess pretty much anywhere at lunch
which<00:01:17.360> if<00:01:17.690> there's<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.020> lot<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.290> wind

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.110 

nothing<00:01:27.710> wrong<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.340> beam<00:01:28.550> I<00:01:28.670> think<00:01:28.940> the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
nothing wrong with that beam I think the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.780 
nothing wrong with that beam I think the
only<00:01:29.560> reason<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.590> few<00:01:30.890> other<00:01:31.070> ways<00:01:31.220> because

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
only reason that few other ways because

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.460 
only reason that few other ways because
I<00:01:32.090> don't<00:01:32.270> want<00:01:32.390> people<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.810> think<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.170> counter

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
I don't want people to think to counter

00:01:33.470 --> 00:04:15.860 
I don't want people to think to counter
is<00:01:33.650> that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.089 

this<00:04:16.320> period<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.739> gonna<00:04:16.919> be<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.220> think

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.439 

maybe<00:04:22.099> later<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.460> we<00:04:22.610> might<00:04:22.939> be<00:04:23.060> able<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.210> find

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
maybe later on we might be able to find

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.279 
maybe later on we might be able to find
a<00:04:23.509> place<00:04:23.689> where<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.930> can<00:04:24.080> show<00:04:24.319> you<00:04:24.379> how<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.590> cast

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
a place where I can show you how to cast

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:59.279 
a place where I can show you how to cast
I<00:04:27.289> really<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:44.449> you<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.659> 20<00:04:44.870> feet<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.229> mine

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.920 

mine<00:05:00.289> is<00:05:00.819> and<00:05:01.819> you<00:05:01.940> do<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.569> fish<00:05:02.750> can

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
mine is and you do that so the fish can

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.189 
mine is and you do that so the fish can
see<00:05:03.169> use<00:05:03.349> it<00:05:03.879> mostly<00:05:04.879> sometimes<00:05:05.449> ok<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:05.870> let's

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
see use it mostly sometimes ok so let's

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.570 
see use it mostly sometimes ok so let's
see<00:05:06.379> we<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.830> full<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:07.099> other<00:05:07.250> set<00:05:07.550> of

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
see we have that full the other set of

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.689 
see we have that full the other set of
courage<00:05:07.969> yeah<00:05:08.210> if<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.110> keep<00:05:09.379> my<00:05:09.469> /<00:05:10.159> mine<00:05:10.430> off

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
courage yeah if I can keep my / mine off

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.689 
courage yeah if I can keep my / mine off
the<00:05:10.909> water<00:05:11.090> okay<00:05:11.479> there's<00:05:12.020> no<00:05:12.199> drag<00:05:12.500> my<00:05:13.430> pike

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
the water okay there's no drag my pike

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.020 
the water okay there's no drag my pike
is<00:05:13.909> taking<00:05:14.270> place

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.510 

for<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.210> couple<00:05:17.420> seconds<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.440> found<00:05:19.010> naturally

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
for a couple seconds we found naturally

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.560 
for a couple seconds we found naturally
with

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
with

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.770 
with
if<00:05:21.410> my

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.440 

you<00:05:27.200> feel<00:05:27.380> like<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:28.010> mine<00:05:28.340> would<00:05:28.610> be<00:05:28.640> on<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
you feel like that mine would be on the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.510 
you feel like that mine would be on the
current<00:05:29.840> fly<00:05:30.680> on<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:30.950> other<00:05:31.070> side<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.340> the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
current fly on the other side of the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.310 
current fly on the other side of the
current<00:05:31.880> they're<00:05:32.630> moving<00:05:32.960> at<00:05:33.020> two<00:05:33.200> different

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
current they're moving at two different

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.780 
current they're moving at two different
speeds<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:34.550> funny<00:05:35.030> stuff<00:05:35.300> is<00:05:35.450> happening<00:05:36.790> so

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
speeds and funny stuff is happening so

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.430 
speeds and funny stuff is happening so
when<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:37.970> show<00:05:38.270> us<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:38.630> play<00:05:38.780> anglers<00:05:39.140> like<00:05:39.290> the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
when I show us and play anglers like the

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.350 
when I show us and play anglers like the
places<00:05:39.830> with<00:05:40.010> big<00:05:40.220> currents<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:40.820> holes<00:05:41.210> on

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
places with big currents and holes on

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.720 
places with big currents and holes on
the<00:05:41.420> other<00:05:41.540> side<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:42.590> can<00:05:42.920> cast<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.430> keep<00:05:43.610> you

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
the other side I can cast and keep you

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.120 
the other side I can cast and keep you
there<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:45.110> it's<00:05:45.260> impossible<00:05:45.530> to<00:05:45.890> do<00:05:46.010> with
