00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
actually cooking it from room

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.539 
actually cooking it from room
temperature<00:02:49.230> doesn't<00:02:50.160> matter<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
temperature doesn't matter about the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.349 
temperature doesn't matter about the
angle<00:02:50.849> just<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:51.480> your<00:02:51.630> goose<00:02:52.489> onto<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:54.060> tray

next<00:02:55.049> step<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.650> hot<00:02:56.579> don't<00:02:57.299> start<00:02:57.569> with

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
next step is this hot don't start with

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.970 
next step is this hot don't start with
cold<00:02:57.840> water<00:02:58.049> because<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> take<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.739> long

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
cold water because going to take a long

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.199 
cold water because going to take a long
time<00:02:59.099> for<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.310> cold<00:02:59.519> water<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> heat<00:02:59.940> up<00:02:59.970> in

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
time for that cold water to heat up in
