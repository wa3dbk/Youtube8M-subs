canceled me calling in my my veto which
i<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.009> actually<00:01:29.780> contributed<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
i think actually contributed to the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.679 
i think actually contributed to the
nuclear<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> see

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
nuclear and it's right here as you see

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
nuclear and it's right here as you see

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the MP to run off because one of my

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.660 
the MP to run off because one of my
worst<00:01:36.810> things<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.619> EMP<00:01:38.009> goes<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
worst things is when an EMP goes up and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
worst things is when an EMP goes up and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
advanced warfare I done a video talking

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.970 
advanced warfare I done a video talking
about<00:02:19.300> opinions<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:19.870> advanced<00:02:20.200> warfare<00:02:20.770> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
about opinions on advanced warfare and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.190 
about opinions on advanced warfare and
it<00:02:21.820> seemed<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.060> everyone<00:02:22.630> sort<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.930> had<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
it seemed like everyone sort of had the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.540 
it seemed like everyone sort of had the
same<00:02:23.230> opinions<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> game<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.370> first

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
same opinions on the game with the first

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.040 
same opinions on the game with the first
release<00:02:24.820> they<00:02:25.030> really<00:02:25.390> enjoyed<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.720> they

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
release they really enjoyed it they

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.140 
release they really enjoyed it they
really<00:02:26.350> liked<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.820> usually

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
really liked it and it's it's usually

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.790 
really liked it and it's it's usually
the<00:02:28.210> honeymoon<00:02:28.600> period<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.200> always<00:02:29.470> see<00:02:29.710> it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
the honeymoon period and I always see it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.080 
the honeymoon period and I always see it
every<00:02:30.100> year<00:02:30.220> with<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.400> call<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.610> duty<00:02:30.640> but<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
every year with a call of duty but it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.430 
every year with a call of duty but it
seemed<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.510> dropped<00:02:31.750> off<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.960> lot<00:02:32.260> quicker

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
seemed like it dropped off a lot quicker

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.370 
seemed like it dropped off a lot quicker
with<00:02:33.190> Vance<00:02:33.490> warfare<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.090> year<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:35.200> think

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
with Vance warfare this year and I think

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.960 
with Vance warfare this year and I think
that's<00:02:35.530> because<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.920> XO<00:02:36.220> movements<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that's because of the XO movements the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.210 
that's because of the XO movements the
bugs<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.870> such<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.650> don't<00:02:38.830> think<00:02:39.010> many

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
bugs and such and I don't think many

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.190 
bugs and such and I don't think many
people<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.610> sort<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.970> justify<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.840> three

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
people can sort of justify the three

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.710 
people can sort of justify the three
years<00:02:41.470> development<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.610> game<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
years development on this game and the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600 
years development on this game and the
the<00:02:43.990> issues<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.320> arose<00:02:44.770> with<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.190> game<00:02:45.430> on

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the issues that arose with this game on

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.060 
the issues that arose with this game on
launch<00:02:46.050> glitches<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.740> weapon

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
launch glitches and so on and weapon

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.010 
launch glitches and so on and weapon
balance<00:02:48.459> don't<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:49.630> people<00:02:49.750> can<00:02:49.990> really

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
balance don't think people can really

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.710 
balance don't think people can really
understand<00:02:50.709> where<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.100> extra<00:02:51.580> year<00:02:51.790> when<00:02:52.000> an

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
understand where that extra year when an

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.270 
understand where that extra year when an
i<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.410> don't<00:02:53.650> understand<00:02:54.070> whether<00:02:54.190> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
i for one I don't understand whether it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.970 
i for one I don't understand whether it
actually<00:02:54.310> year<00:02:54.730> when<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> see<00:02:56.830> people

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
actually year when but I see people

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.220 
actually year when but I see people
moaning<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.850> they're<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.660> same<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.020> game

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
moaning and they're the same the game

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.510 
moaning and they're the same the game
