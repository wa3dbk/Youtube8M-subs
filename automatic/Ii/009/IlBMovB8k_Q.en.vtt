00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.840
 in the pinilla ski resort it 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.549
 It will become the perfect setting for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.220
 another extreme sports are going to 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.560
 practice the mountain descent 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.680
 bike 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.990
 luismi this bicycle how much it costs 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.130
 well about six thousand euros six thousand euros 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.110
 it's like a motocross bike in 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.779
 miniature but all lightened to the maximum 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.410
 the discs the suspensions and from 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.240
 when this hobby today this because 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.279
 I believe that all of almost tiny 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.169
 that when I have the money that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.300
 you work and you have more 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:38.270
 economic possibilities because it 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.760
 turns yes but that does not think that 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.150
 he will think it would not count you have stones 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.250
 you have curves that against peralta das that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.380
 you can fall at any time but 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.210
 Come on , that's what I say, you go out, you 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.800
 you dress and you only think about going down and 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.990
 enjoy with friends there is fog 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.820
 right now and it rains or is that too 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.130
 makes the floor more slippery 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.540
 that prevents you from continuing this sport in 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.860
 concrete this summer we carry all the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.160
 summer praying for him to make a day 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.160
 common 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.479
 I'm not almost 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.820
 this is a cervical protector everything 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.369
 we can wear is little knee pads 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 shin guards the breastplate as you have seen 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.549
 before espalier the cervical protector and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 integral helmet at the end we go much more 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.630
 armored what it looks like 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.520
 and what is that insurance 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.270
 by manufacturing 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.640
 I see that you are renting a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.700
 lesson has already been among some others 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.630
 I had an accident one two years ago 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
 well in a jump and I was broken a helmet 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.009
 of motorcycle and because I had protection and cough 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.360
 He had no Whiplash I was a 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.549
 weeks and that is that the collar 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.369
 milks like now all this 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.439
 equipment how much is the rent and 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.399
 completely with bicycle and is the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.399
 occupation is 100 euros 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:07.090
 there are more mouths and also refreshment 27 euros 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.049
 and one and a half euro more 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.549
 this extra insurance is important 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.549
 it is supposedly the backing of above 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 we always have accidents the sport of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 accident risk 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.269
 the girl of the group for now good because 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.920
 it's my first season very well 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.409
 pretty good I like it a lot and it's super 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.409
 funny adrenaline 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:49.230
 it's like everything is a risky sport and 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.349
 always in all sports smoking that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.760
 they tell you with my mother that I'm crazy and 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:00.019
 my friends and 38 so enjoy and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.019
 way thank you very much 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.980
 now we are pulling her 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.750
 we think we 're a couple of crazies 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.599
 we splurged on the slopes there 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.730
 kill us and it's really not like that is a 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.010
 sport the other and it's one more sport 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.110
 pretty hard both for physical and for 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.110
 concentration by technique 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.030
 you know them from competitions you've 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.030
 arrived 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.360
 fixed in their fields of Spain sir 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.300
 blows you've had many many had 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 broken part of the ankle clavicle hand 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.450
 and as they say mothers in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.950
 Carmelites 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.950
 every time I have gone faster 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.990
 what happened now 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.659
 and I go down this way and that is new 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:47.430
 I do not know if this is too much clue for 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:47.430
 the one that does look good 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.119
 the difficulty is in tension between 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.490
 trees and not overcome those potholes these 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.389
 curves and above all the slope and the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.389
 speed so that they go down 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.730
 Hello 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.050
 you are waiting in fact for your 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.050
 comrades who are coming exact 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.960
 very steep slope with stones and 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.960
 a lot of pine 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.720
 it has already happened 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.020
 blow 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.300
 with this it's over and now I see 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.069
 harvest 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.599
 to counterweight 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.559
 so what you see is what you do 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:23.839
 have a close up of your face and the 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.839
 face is static and then the body 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:36.370
 we have to work again
