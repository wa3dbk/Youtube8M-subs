00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.300
 found above the Lord of the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.820
 contracts where you talk about what is the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.410
 gate so good here in this part in 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.539
 this part sorry for the right so I 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.890
 we are not going to talk to him and good and 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.510
 remember that this character has a 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.949
 reputation which we have to raise 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.850
 by means of what they are then 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.079
 contracts or playing crucible in an event 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.519
 there appears not you called 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.129
 iron banner so good you're going to 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.170
 have to go play to get some 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.699
 how many points ok now here 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.379
 find the six contracts these are 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.580
 they are replacing every so often each 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.060
 Once you finish them all the period 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.560
 I think you appear more but good 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.630
 rewards of the event we have several 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.480
 here as you can see we have two for 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.720
 after 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.170
 the pair of gloves snyder a weapon 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.410
 Main we have several icons shaders 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.990
 and then what a band does not give a 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.640
 for an object is good for what it is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 your guardian and design dependencies 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.410
 titan there was hunter in the first part 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.290
 we have what are the boots these go up 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.030
 up to 309 defense have light 24 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.820
 remember that all the armors that are 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.550
 find here will go up to 33 light 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.990
 it has intellect and strength and the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.490
 improvement that it has is that it allows you 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.100
 bring more bullets for rifles 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.440
 automatic and unlocks at level 3 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.450
 of the iron standard now the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640
 second boots because they have intellect 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.220
 they have discipline carries more ammunition 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.130
 for the explorer and good fuses 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.190
 unlocks to level 3 of the action of 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.210
 iron now we have the gloves these 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.950
 they climb up to 347 defense 33 light 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.570
 will rise will also have intellect and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.040
 discipline of the improvements that they have 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.480
 these gloves is that it increases the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 Refill speed of the rifles 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.680
 automatic and also causing harm 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.210
 melee reduces the time of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.750
 recovery of your grenades 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.480
 and it locks at level 4 of the standard the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.610
 next is to approach watson you have to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.920
 call have intellect have 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390
 discipline and the improvements that they have 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 It is increasing the charging speed 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.200
 of the explorer's rifles when causing 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.420
 damage with a grenade reduces time 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.660
 of recovery from your body to body 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.550
 case and good and it locks at level 4 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.750
 iron standard now we have what 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.110
 which is the sniper which then has 272 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 of attack will go up to 331 have three 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.520
 bullets in the charger has sun damage and 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.110
 good of the improvements that it has is that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 the casualties of accuracy with this weapon 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.520
 they make whites explode which 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.470
 makes it a little good one of the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.650
 best in the diet and that killing 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.310
 a good person a little monkey is not a 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.140
 enemy if there are several together obviously 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.150
 it's going to cause too much damage to 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.100
 they good you can also find what 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.730
 that is more ammunition for this weapon what 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.400
 which is obviously 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.650
 Well, well, because if you play for 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 for example crucible good will 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.760
 serve that when you put a person you go 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.640
 to find or going to drop some bullets that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.799
 it is not so likely that they are crucible 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 but in the campaign like that it's going to happen to you 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.090
 but hey it unlocks at level 4 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.989
 extend iron we now have what 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.569
 is the main weapon that is a the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.660
 automatic and also has three good 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.200
 will go up to 331 attack the charger is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.060
 of 66 bullets I think it goes up to 77 I think 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.950
 of the improvements it has is that the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.060
 last half of each charger cause 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.129
 additional damage 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.379
 this weapon has more stability and 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.840
 good unlocks at level 5 of 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.989
 standard of iron and good in the part 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.650
 down we have some then and know the 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.000
 emblems of which the truth is not not 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.560
 my brother to all the attention to me but 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.090
 good is what at level one of 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.099
 iron banner 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.620
 we have the white shader that is blocked 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.810
 at level 2 we have the second as 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.660
 emblem which is unlocked at the level 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.310
 three we have then the band the sorcerer 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.060
 good in this on this occasion 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.160
 obviously I have 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:32.040
 but but there is a fucking robe for a 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.020
 towel for the titan and what is a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.690
 coat for him 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.849
 the hunter and well on this side we have 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.800
 other shader which then crashes 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.599
 level 5 and go on par is down 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.550
 we have some implementers which 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.340
 obviously it gives you like that the possibility 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.849
 to earn something better and worth a speck of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.500
 light and good until the little ones all nenes 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.599
 so well I hope you liked it 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.159

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.099
 means the iron standard that 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.009
 it brings and what it does is to 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.659
 unlocking things you did not like 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.039

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.710
