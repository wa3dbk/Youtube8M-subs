00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.699
 let's make a very rich dessert that 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.189
 let's elaborate with an ajillo to go to 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.989
 be a chair filled with cake 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.329
 Almendra Souza will bring cream from Iraq 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.360
 and we are going to cover it with a reduction of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.400
 liquor coffee think you'll see what it is with 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.480
 a kind of tiramisu filloa version 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.430
 because it has a very rich flavor 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.530
 that remembers a little bit that flavor of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.960
 coffee tiramisu and the first thing 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.079
 we have to do is prepare our 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.109
 filloa we have 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.480
 and the dough prepared with milk and eggs 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.149
 flour you can check the ingredients 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.399
 remember that they are for four people and 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.490
 once it is whipped and rested it is 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.250
 mass what we are going to do is pour it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.409
 on the pan with the fire a little 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.659
 high to get to do our 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.510
 first filloa 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.870
 we will leave 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.370
 that set and then we turn it around 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.930
 and let's leave it thickens a little 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.690
 because we have it at very minimum fire and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.700
 this gives us time to do other things 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.260
 we have the almond cake you know 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.450
 What is a typical Santiago cake? 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.430
 cake that we have here in galicia and that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.010
 it's so rich and that people like it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.710
 both use it for those desserts 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.510
 express and what we are going to do is the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.940
 we have crumbled a little tense in the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.470
 we have removed a little piece of cake and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.440
 we have crumbled and we have left 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.430
 made little friends to add a 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.500
 small amount of coffee liqueur 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 small amount do not pass that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.510
 It is also not convenient to put a quantity 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.340
 excessive alcohol and it remains a very 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.340
 Strong is preferable to buy 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.170
 accompany her after a shot of coffee 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.120
 nice cool next to the pancake 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.890
 we put that small amount of liquor 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.350
 coffee and we're going to add the cream 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.260
 the cream is already whipped cream 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.630
 feiraco nata gallega and let's mix it 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.630
 with our almond cake crumbs 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.390
 soaked in coffee liqueur we are going to move a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.160
 bit 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.990
 and we have our fill ready 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.180
 for the chair 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.010
 let's leave it here ready 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
 we have the row to turn it around if 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.790
 we make it to fire stronger you have to 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.520
 go quickie and if we can not cook them to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.290
 very slow fire we turn it over or with 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.240
 your hands or if you will not go through 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.220
 turn by hand what we do is with 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.410
 a slotted spoon with a tongue 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.290
 we put in and we turn it around 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.020
 we have our filloa we leave a 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.510
 a little more 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.190
 so that it has just been cooked and we had it 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.380
 to a saucer 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.360
 we have our filloa here and now there's 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.200
 that fill it you know we can 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.420
 fold it 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.599
 that is, we can make a canutillo 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.519
 with it we can fold it into triangles 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.230
 or we can make packets in this case 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.090
 what we are going to do is a little packet 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.819
 let's put the prettiest side always 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.810
 on the outside we are going to place the cream 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.849
 mounted the cream that I have not told you 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.200
 we have also put after mounting 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.930
 a little icing sugar so it's 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.079
 sweetest good we're going to fold 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.329
 let's double this row already has the 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.579
 cream filling with the cake of santiago 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.620
 soaked with the coffee liqueur we make 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.750
 a fold we can make a double is 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.409
 lateral first we close first by the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.480
 sides and now we make a small 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.950
 packet 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 we turn around we have here our 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.140
 chair and now let's prepare 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.230
 quickly a reduction of brown liquor 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.540
 as we make it very simple we take the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.700
 pan we put the fire a little high 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.700
 and we throw the coffee liquor 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.870
 and a little sugar 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.680
 I'm going to get alcohol very fast like that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.680
 that you have no problem 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.069
 there is not going to be a thing a figure very 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.020
 borracha vale is going to be left with that 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.360
 puntito a liquor coffee but let's 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.940
 get it reduced a lot 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.410
 alcohol and that thick we are going to raise the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.580
 fire 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.710
 you have to be careful that we do not know 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 burn but we are reducing to that 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.560
 Caramelito is going to look like a candy 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.780
 of coffee liqueur 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.580
 You can use certain liquors to 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.110
 make these accompaniments of the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.919
 desserts that were always a point a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.540
 little bit different and we also use 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.580
 the liquors in the kitchen that is always 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.160
 interesting that they are not relegated 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.290
 always then to that shot to finish the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.030
 food but also have a presence 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.070
 in the kitchen 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.289
 let's do then finally the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.089
 Placed fixed how it is reduced 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.279
 and it remains a sort of 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:22.249
 coffee liqueur candy we let 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:25.849
 temper a little bit of nothing and what 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.619
 let's do to finish everything is 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:32.059
 having a little bit of that idea of 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:34.899
 tiramisu let's put a little bit of 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.899
 cocoa powder 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.220
 there we have it, you know some taps 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:47.970
 to the colander and we already have that capita 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:52.740
 cocoa this is pure cocoa would not bring 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:55.639
 sugar or fat and finally our 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.659
 candy 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.659
 coffee liqueur 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.099
 and you already have a dessert 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.419
 easy to do and I'm sure it's going 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.419
 to triumph in your guests
