00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 Hello 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 good before starting and introduction 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.020
 First, I want to say that it is a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 honor is being your teacher 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.470
 wherever you are accessing the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 Youtube site if she studies clash. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
 touch this html course 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 If you downloaded, you 're watching TV. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 human such device on your cell phone 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
 It's cool, we'll start 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.989
 learning html is right what it is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.950
 interesting and an issue that I want 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.690
 dealing with you here is really this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.440
 question of my teaching method is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.030
 folks 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
 So, for example, how did you see today? 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 I'm an extrovert guy so I like 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120
 to be teaching and always commenting 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.079
 sometimes I do some kind of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.760
 Just kidding 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.850
 Okay, but it's not to be in that business. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.329
 I'm on the right track then I hope you 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.980
 like my teaching method that you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.769
 come on is learning html and not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 getting only these videotapes in this course 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.909
 of html that you so fear 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 Ok that you come is always accessing 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.250
 a study clÃ©s 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
 really exploring this fantastic 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 markup language 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 Okay, so speaking a little bit about the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.330
 The course is going to have us going. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 see in reality what it is and html 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 Where should we use it? 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.079
 If you 're already without this course, it's because 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 you must have knowledge about the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.439
 you want html and you should already have a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 Notion at least 11 you want 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.549
 use it is either by indication of 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.729
 a friend because you want to learn to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799
 create sites is independent of the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 its ok then we will have 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.340
 an introduction html folks going on 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.100
 this introduction of the course to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.619
 people are going to be seeing what the html is 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.070
 to which you must apply the html 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.509
 I basically touched it, we'll go 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.610
 making the necessary tools not 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.560
 is developing html are very 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 simple and you 're sure to be 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 liking this language because it is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.860
 easy to understand and very simple to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.009
 be understood why are you going to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.189
 get 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.760
 is learning by seeing how she 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:18.579
 works and is assimilating quickly 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.620
 its main aspects ok later 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.120
 from the concept of tags that is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 a little thing that is a good thing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780
 feature of html because it is the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.829
 markup language 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.500
 We'll be seeing one later. 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.959
 attribute of these tags are we going 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 develop an html page soon in 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.120
 followed 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.940
 We will then work with the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.329
 html elements themselves that in the case will be 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.790
 texts and images links for you to click 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.810
 link and take you to another page 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.980
 touch lists there are tables and forms 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.230
 if you want to make a 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.720
 contact your site or put some 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.150
 referral form 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.889
 Okay, we 'll go to the layout later. 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.450
 It 's a very good match that is 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.450
 It's just the question of you 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 interacting with the assembly of your site 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.879
 in itself 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.480
 You'll have a simple design but 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.010
 very intuitive that will be healed 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.980
 majority of your doubts about the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.109
 development of a web project doc 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.180
 then you can see I even put that 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:21.099
 the title as html css is the combination 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.720
 perfect where we 're really is 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.609
 interact a little bit with the sheets of 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 style nor css 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.440
 and you will really see that it is a 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.290
 need that can not be left there 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.180
 side and finally to end the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.510
 course we are already seeing the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.489
 html5 and its main news 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.949
 all right then html5 is what it is he 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.930
 is the html in a newer version only 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.870
 this and has introduced some new 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.859
 tags some new concepts that are well 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.290
 interesting 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.940
 Okay, so you'll learn it too. 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.609
 in html course 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.019
 Okay, I'll ask you after 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.209
 finishing the course be not only in not 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.099

 also share spread the word 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.660
 because this is knowledge is a 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.910
 Free knowledge is okay then as 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.190
