hey what's crackin peeps I'm glad to see
you<00:01:05.680> back<00:01:05.860> for<00:01:06.040> yet<00:01:06.190> another<00:01:06.250> minecraft

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
you back for yet another minecraft

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.660 
you back for yet another minecraft
invention<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:07.990> as<00:01:08.410> you<00:01:08.470> guys<00:01:08.770> just<00:01:09.070> saw<00:01:09.250> this

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
invention so as you guys just saw this

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.740 
invention so as you guys just saw this
was<00:01:09.910> my<00:01:10.240> take<00:01:10.660> on<00:01:10.870> a<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> particle<00:01:12.880> kinda<00:01:13.540> a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
was my take on a on a particle kinda a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.050 
was my take on a on a particle kinda a
particle-based<00:01:14.680> magical<00:01:15.520> barrier<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
particle-based magical barrier and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.600 
particle-based magical barrier and
vanilla<00:01:16.810> minecraft<00:01:16.960> so<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.280> red<00:01:18.430> cell

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
vanilla minecraft so the red cell

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.950 
vanilla minecraft so the red cell
mechanics<00:01:19.119> behind<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.479> are<00:01:19.690> very

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
mechanics behind this are very

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.230 
mechanics behind this are very
straightforward<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.160> as<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.369> see<00:01:21.520> here<00:01:21.760> we

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
straightforward so as you see here we

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.660 
straightforward so as you see here we
just<00:01:22.450> have<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.600> simple<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.740> clip<00:01:24.010> for<00:01:24.460> tech

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
just have a simple for clip for tech

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.440 
just have a simple for clip for tech
clock<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.470> there's<00:01:26.979> just<00:01:27.640> about<00:01:27.760> three

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
clock and so there's just about three

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.700 
clock and so there's just about three
different<00:01:28.570> components<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.410> this<00:01:29.530> whole

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
different components to this whole

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.520 
different components to this whole
device<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.790> first<00:01:31.000> part<00:01:31.210> part<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.930> when

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
device so the first part part is when

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.160 
device so the first part part is when
you<00:01:32.650> get<00:01:32.740> close<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.490> portal<00:01:33.790> itself<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
you get close to the portal itself you

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.690 
you get close to the portal itself you
might<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.470> heard<00:01:35.710> like<00:01:36.190> this<00:01:36.490> like

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
might have heard like this like

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.359 
might have heard like this like
whispering<00:01:37.420> portal<00:01:37.930> sound<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
whispering portal sound this is the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.550 
whispering portal sound this is the
command<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.759> do<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.030> its<00:01:40.210> place<00:01:40.869> on<00:01:41.080> portal<00:01:41.500> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
command to do it its place on portal a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.700 
command to do it its place on portal a
portal<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.060> nearest<00:01:43.360> player<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.990> then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
portal to the nearest player and then

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.719 
portal to the nearest player and then
the<00:01:45.160> coordinates<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.930> maximum<00:01:46.930> value<00:01:47.380> ah

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the coordinates of it maximum value ah

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.560 
the coordinates of it maximum value ah
the<00:01:48.729> frequency<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.990> or<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.580> pitch<00:01:51.760> it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
the frequency of it or the pitch it's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.210 
the frequency of it or the pitch it's
very<00:01:52.780> low<00:01:53.050> so<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:53.409> point<00:01:53.650> one<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:53.830> then<00:01:54.159> the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
very low so it's point one and then the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220 
very low so it's point one and then the
minimum<00:01:54.550> value<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.270> zero<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:55.780> if<00:01:55.930> you're<00:01:56.080> far

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
minimum value is zero so if you're far

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.750 
minimum value is zero so if you're far
enough<00:01:56.320> away<00:01:56.560> you're<00:01:57.220> not<00:01:57.400> going<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> be<00:01:57.730> able

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
enough away you're not going to be able

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.230 
enough away you're not going to be able
to<00:01:58.000> hear<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.400> that's<00:02:00.580> how<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> sounds

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
to hear it and so that's how the sounds

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.930 
to hear it and so that's how the sounds
work<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.659> then<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.530> portable<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.490> for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
work and then for the portable for for

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.759 
work and then for the portable for for
the<00:02:04.030> portal<00:02:04.420> particles<00:02:05.310> for<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.490> let<00:02:07.150> me<00:02:07.240> just

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
the portal particles for the let me just

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.650 
the portal particles for the let me just
break<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.830> couple<00:02:09.250> blocks<00:02:09.399> right<00:02:09.670> here<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:10.330> for

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
break a couple blocks right here so for

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.830 
break a couple blocks right here so for
these<00:02:10.780> particles<00:02:11.290> right<00:02:11.560> here<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:13.480> see<00:02:13.690> how

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
these particles right here I you see how

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.130 
these particles right here I you see how
we<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.440> almost<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.459> jail<00:02:15.820> cell<00:02:16.269> type

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
we had like almost these jail cell type

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.740 
we had like almost these jail cell type
poles<00:02:17.709> made<00:02:18.459> out<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.850> these<00:02:18.970> portal<00:02:19.299> particles

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
poles made out of these portal particles

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.600 
poles made out of these portal particles
and<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.250> commands<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
and so the commands for this as I you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.240 
and so the commands for this as I you
want<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.850> summon<00:02:25.090> particles<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.890> particle

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
want to summon particles the particle

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.949 
want to summon particles the particle
names<00:02:27.430> are<00:02:27.610> portal<00:02:27.910> choose<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.540> coordinates

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
names are portal choose the coordinates

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.070 
names are portal choose the coordinates
of<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.860> want<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.100> set<00:02:30.310> your<00:02:30.430> height<00:02:30.670> 22<00:02:31.269> but

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
of it and want to set your height 22 but

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.610 
of it and want to set your height 22 but
you<00:02:32.170> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> set<00:02:32.560> your<00:02:32.650> x<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.190> z<00:02:33.430> 20<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:35.260> it's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
you want to set your x and z 20 so it's

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.259 
you want to set your x and z 20 so it's
just<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.160> form<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.519> straight<00:02:36.790> line<00:02:36.850> and

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
just going to form a straight line and

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.990 
just going to form a straight line and
then<00:02:37.870> most<00:02:38.200> importantly<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:39.250> want<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.760> set

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
then most importantly you want to set

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.590 
then most importantly you want to set
your<00:02:40.239> speed<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.070> 0.01<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.120> isn't<00:02:43.450> going

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
your speed to 0.01 so this isn't going

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.030 
your speed to 0.01 so this isn't going
to<00:02:43.660> make<00:02:43.750> them<00:02:43.900> fly<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.260> over<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.650> place<00:02:44.860> like

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
to make them fly all over the place like

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890 
to make them fly all over the place like
they<00:02:45.220> usually<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.720> just

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
they usually do and then you can just

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.330 
they usually do and then you can just
summon<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.709> 250<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.790> these<00:02:49.739> particles<00:02:50.739> just<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
summon in 250 of these particles just to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100 
summon in 250 of these particles just to
make<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.519> fill<00:02:51.940> up<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.299> look<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.630> pole<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
make it fill up and look like a pole and

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.710 
make it fill up and look like a pole and
then<00:02:53.799> we<00:02:54.430> also<00:02:54.760> had<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.840> wall<00:02:56.380> type

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
then we also had like this wall type

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.480 
then we also had like this wall type
particle<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.900> along<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> pulse<00:02:59.709> the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
particle to along with the pulse the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.180 
particle to along with the pulse the
swall<00:03:00.730> part<00:03:01.000> particle<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:02.410> was<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.710> town<00:03:02.890> or<00:03:03.160> a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
swall part particle it was the town or a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.430 
swall part particle it was the town or a
particle<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.690> was<00:03:04.810> set<00:03:04.960> for<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.230> whole

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
particle and it was set for this whole

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.400 
particle and it was set for this whole
region<00:03:05.830> its<00:03:06.490> height<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.850> too<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.810> X<00:03:08.110> was

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
region its height was too and it's X was

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.670 
region its height was too and it's X was
too<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:08.890> not<00:03:09.190> its<00:03:09.550> Y<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.290> made<00:03:11.530> it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
too but not its Y so this just made it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.780 
too but not its Y so this just made it
flat<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:13.270> think<00:03:14.020> this<00:03:14.200> particle<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.310> in

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
flat and I think this particle and in

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.420 
flat and I think this particle and in
particular<00:03:16.540> did<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.810> very<00:03:16.930> good<00:03:17.080> job<00:03:17.230> at<00:03:17.650> making

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
particular did a very good job at making

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.910 
particular did a very good job at making
it<00:03:18.700> seem<00:03:19.000> flat<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:20.200> like<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.410> surface

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it seem flat and just like a surface

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.180 
it seem flat and just like a surface
very<00:03:21.700> nice<00:03:21.970> uh<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.990> speed<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.470> was<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.920> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
very nice uh the speed of it was one and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.150 
very nice uh the speed of it was one and
it<00:03:25.030> was<00:03:25.090> 250<00:03:26.020> particles<00:03:26.590> every<00:03:26.860> time<00:03:27.010> this

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
it was 250 particles every time this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.910 
it was 250 particles every time this
went<00:03:27.370> off<00:03:27.490> so<00:03:28.180> that's<00:03:28.750> how<00:03:28.990> this<00:03:29.410> portal<00:03:29.800> right

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
went off so that's how this portal right

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.100 
went off so that's how this portal right
here<00:03:30.190> was<00:03:30.340> made<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.360> can<00:03:31.540> see<00:03:31.720> we're

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
here was made and you can see we're

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.780 
here was made and you can see we're
getting<00:03:32.260> close<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.980> sounds<00:03:33.340> are<00:03:33.490> meeting

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
getting close so the sounds are meeting

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.700 
getting close so the sounds are meeting
made<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.720> get<00:03:34.900> further<00:03:35.050> away<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.440> you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
made and we get further away and you

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.900 
made and we get further away and you
can't<00:03:35.920> hear<00:03:36.130> them<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> that's<00:03:37.810> how<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.020> works

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
can't hear them so that's how that works

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.790 
can't hear them so that's how that works
next<00:03:39.910> things<00:03:40.180> next<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:41.200> smoke<00:03:41.470> grenade

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
next things next the smoke grenade

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.940 
next things next the smoke grenade
mechanics<00:03:42.550> if<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.290> think<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.830> have<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
mechanics if I just I think I have a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.010 
mechanics if I just I think I have a
couple<00:03:45.160> back<00:03:45.400> here<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.300> just<00:03:46.330> give<00:03:46.600> myself<00:03:46.780> a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
couple back here if I just give myself a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.580 
couple back here if I just give myself a
smoke<00:03:47.260> grenade<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.910> what<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:50.410> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
smoke grenade so what this is is this is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.250 
smoke grenade so what this is is this is
basically<00:03:51.130> just<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.670> silver<00:03:52.270> spit<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.660> silver

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
basically just a silver spit a silver

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.700 
basically just a silver spit a silver
fish<00:03:53.470> egg<00:03:54.030> rename<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.240> smoke<00:03:55.480> grenade<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.960> so

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
fish egg rename the smoke grenade and so

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.590 
fish egg rename the smoke grenade and so
what's<00:03:56.890> going<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.070> happen<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.610> when<00:03:58.150> we<00:03:58.300> right

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
what's going to happen is when we right

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.810 
what's going to happen is when we right
click<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.080> going<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.380> summon<00:03:59.740> a<00:03:59.890> silver<00:04:00.610> fish

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
click it's going to summon a silver fish

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.880 
click it's going to summon a silver fish
with<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.240> name<00:04:01.390> smoke<00:04:01.690> grenade<00:04:01.990> but<00:04:02.740> then

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
with the name smoke grenade but then

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.830 
with the name smoke grenade but then
what's<00:04:03.130> going<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.370> happen<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.940> these<00:04:04.480> three

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
what's going to happen is these three

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.800 
what's going to happen is these three
command<00:04:05.170> blocks<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.630> make<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
command blocks I it's going to make a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.550 
command blocks I it's going to make a
particle<00:04:08.290> cloud<00:04:08.500> around<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.630> entity<00:04:11.140> with

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
particle cloud around to the entity with

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.250 
particle cloud around to the entity with
the<00:04:11.650> name<00:04:11.860> smoke<00:04:12.340> grenade<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.840> silverfish

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
the name smoke grenade so the silverfish

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.690 
the name smoke grenade so the silverfish
has<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.710> name<00:04:14.860> smoke<00:04:15.160> grenade<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.580> it's

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
has the name smoke grenade and it's

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.520 
has the name smoke grenade and it's
going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.420> at<00:04:17.170> the<00:04:17.320> same<00:04:17.470> time

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
going to do that and at the same time

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.490 
going to do that and at the same time
it's<00:04:17.980> just<00:04:18.160> going<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.460> give<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:19.500> silverfish

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
it's just going to give the silverfish

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.190 
it's just going to give the silverfish
it's<00:04:20.859> going<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.100> give<00:04:21.190> its<00:04:21.370> lowest<00:04:21.820> level<00:04:22.200> 255

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
it's going to give its lowest level 255

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.030 
it's going to give its lowest level 255
and<00:04:24.040> just<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.880> can't<00:04:25.120> move<00:04:25.270> anywhere<00:04:25.540> and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and just so I it can't move anywhere and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.220 
and just so I it can't move anywhere and
blindness<00:04:27.040> or<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.550> mean<00:04:27.850> invisibility<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.900> know

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
blindness or I mean invisibility I know

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.600 
blindness or I mean invisibility I know
it<00:04:29.410> doesn't<00:04:29.560> really<00:04:29.740> help<00:04:29.920> much<00:04:30.070> since<00:04:30.490> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
it doesn't really help much since you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.570 
it doesn't really help much since you
can<00:04:30.760> see<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.060> for<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.300> split<00:04:31.600> second<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:32.580> just

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
can see it for a split second but just

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.690 
can see it for a split second but just
to<00:04:33.670> be<00:04:33.820> safe<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:34.330> feel<00:04:35.050> like<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.770> invisibility

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
to be safe I feel like the invisibility

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.980 
to be safe I feel like the invisibility
helps<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.850> way<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> get<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.810> to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
helps and the way that you get it to

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.260 
helps and the way that you get it to
detect<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.680> there<00:04:42.100> are<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:44.580> both<00:04:45.580> of<00:04:45.880> the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
detect if there are if both of the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.330 
detect if there are if both of the
silverfish<00:04:46.780> are<00:04:47.110> here<00:04:47.320> if<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.860> lay<00:04:48.010> one<00:04:48.310> down

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
silverfish are here if I lay one down

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.460 
silverfish are here if I lay one down
right<00:04:48.760> here<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.750> can<00:04:50.020> see<00:04:50.050> it's<00:04:50.290> right

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
right here so you can see it's right

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.130 
right here so you can see it's right
there<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.240> one<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.360> these<00:04:52.480> competitors<00:04:52.960> in

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
there and one of these competitors in

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.900 
there and one of these competitors in
the<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:53.380> gate<00:04:53.590> went<00:04:54.100> off<00:04:54.190> this<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:54.820> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
the and gate went off this is just the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.760 
the and gate went off this is just the
test<00:04:55.120> for<00:04:55.330> entities<00:04:55.720> with<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.290> name<00:04:56.440> smoke

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
test for entities with the name smoke

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.190 
test for entities with the name smoke
grenade<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:58.090> specific<00:04:58.690> coordinates

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
grenade and that specific coordinates

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.470 
grenade and that specific coordinates
and<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.310> it's<00:05:00.460> hooked<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:00.790> an<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.360> gate

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
and so it's hooked up to an and gate

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.720 
and so it's hooked up to an and gate
once<00:05:01.870> both<00:05:02.080> of<00:05:02.290> these<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:02.560> turned<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:02.950> what's

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
once both of these are turned on what's

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.830 
once both of these are turned on what's
going<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.030> happen<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.620> it's<00:05:05.620> going<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
going to happen is it's going to I and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.180 
going to happen is it's going to I and
it's<00:05:07.840> going<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.110> set<00:05:08.320> block<00:05:08.560> an<00:05:08.740> iron<00:05:08.979> door

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
it's going to set block an iron door

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.670 
it's going to set block an iron door
right<00:05:09.430> here<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.000> right<00:05:10.030> here<00:05:10.180> now<00:05:11.140> how<00:05:11.380> this

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
right here and right here now how this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.920 
right here and right here now how this
on<00:05:11.950> how<00:05:12.700> this<00:05:12.880> kind<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.270> magical

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
on how this kind of magical

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.790 
on how this kind of magical
actually<00:05:14.800> worked<00:05:15.009> was<00:05:15.820> on<00:05:16.560> what<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.650> have

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
actually worked was on what we have

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.629 
actually worked was on what we have
right<00:05:17.979> here<00:05:18.039> is<00:05:18.479> just<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.750> simple<00:05:20.639> barrier

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
right here is just a simple barrier

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.580 
right here is just a simple barrier
reset<00:05:22.060> and<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:22.419> what<00:05:22.570> this<00:05:22.660> is<00:05:22.720> going<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:23.110> do<00:05:23.229> if

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
reset and so what this is going to do if

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.379 
reset and so what this is going to do if
I<00:05:23.889> just<00:05:24.100> hit<00:05:24.280> all<00:05:24.430> these<00:05:24.610> make<00:05:24.940> sure<00:05:25.090> they're

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
I just hit all these make sure they're

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.590 
I just hit all these make sure they're
all<00:05:25.419> activated<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.669> as<00:05:27.759> you<00:05:27.880> can<00:05:27.970> see<00:05:28.150> here<00:05:28.360> and

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
all activated so as you can see here and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.120 
all activated so as you can see here and
kind<00:05:28.870> of<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:28.990> checkered<00:05:29.229> pattern<00:05:29.500> we<00:05:29.919> have

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
kind of a checkered pattern we have

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.430 
kind of a checkered pattern we have
these<00:05:30.370> iron<00:05:30.699> doors<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.300> did<00:05:31.840> not<00:05:31.990> come<00:05:32.169> up<00:05:32.320> with

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
these iron doors I did not come up with

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.620 
these iron doors I did not come up with
this<00:05:32.530> technique<00:05:32.949> I<00:05:33.190> found<00:05:33.850> this<00:05:33.970> out<00:05:34.180> through

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
this technique I found this out through

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.150 
this technique I found this out through
the<00:05:34.900> youtubes<00:05:35.259> not<00:05:35.560> sure<00:05:35.740> who<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.039> original

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
the youtubes not sure who the original

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.420 
the youtubes not sure who the original
guys<00:05:36.639> but<00:05:37.120> kudos<00:05:38.050> whoever<00:05:38.380> found<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.800> works

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
guys but kudos whoever found it works

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.310 
guys but kudos whoever found it works
out<00:05:39.610> great<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.090> especially<00:05:40.389> in<00:05:40.690> game<00:05:40.720> mode<00:05:41.020> to

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
out great and especially in game mode to

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.850 
out great and especially in game mode to
to<00:05:42.310> where<00:05:42.550> it's<00:05:43.180> not<00:05:43.360> game<00:05:43.600> mode<00:05:43.750> 3<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.199> game<00:05:44.710> 0

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
to where it's not game mode 3 and game 0

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.529 
to where it's not game mode 3 and game 0
2<00:05:44.889> when<00:05:45.310> you<00:05:45.430> hold<00:05:45.580> an<00:05:45.729> item<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.300> can't

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
2 when you hold an item you can't

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.290 
2 when you hold an item you can't
actually<00:05:46.750> see<00:05:47.289> any<00:05:47.590> of<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> hitboxes<00:05:48.400> so<00:05:48.940> it

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
actually see any of the hitboxes so it

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.939 
actually see any of the hitboxes so it
does<00:05:49.570> look<00:05:49.810> like<00:05:49.840> there<00:05:50.229> is<00:05:50.259> absolutely

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
does look like there is absolutely

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.550 
does look like there is absolutely
nothing<00:05:51.250> right<00:05:51.699> here<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.810> I'm<00:05:53.229> very<00:05:53.289> happy

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
nothing right here and so I'm very happy

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.540 
nothing right here and so I'm very happy
with<00:05:53.889> that<00:05:54.099> and<00:05:55.740> so<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.099> yeah<00:05:57.250> that's<00:05:57.400> pretty

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
with that and so so yeah that's pretty

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.060 
with that and so so yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:57.880> it<00:05:58.720> set<00:05:58.930> blocks<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.380> iron<00:05:59.500> door<00:05:59.800> that

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
much it it set blocks the iron door that

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.760 
much it it set blocks the iron door that
just<00:06:00.400> kind<00:06:00.550> of<00:06:00.610> gets<00:06:00.759> rid<00:06:01.180> of<00:06:01.210> them<00:06:01.530> because<00:06:02.530> it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
just kind of gets rid of them because it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.920 
just kind of gets rid of them because it
updates<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.430> half<00:06:03.820> iron<00:06:04.120> doors<00:06:04.389> which<00:06:04.690> makes

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
updates the half iron doors which makes

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.510 
updates the half iron doors which makes
them<00:06:05.050> all<00:06:05.199> disappear<00:06:05.410> it's<00:06:05.979> just<00:06:06.190> kind<00:06:06.370> an

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
them all disappear it's just kind an

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.499 
them all disappear it's just kind an
easy<00:06:06.789> way<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.509> make<00:06:07.750> them<00:06:07.990> all<00:06:08.110> disappear<00:06:08.139> and

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
easy way to make them all disappear and

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.210 
easy way to make them all disappear and
this<00:06:10.509> is<00:06:10.660> just<00:06:10.810> going<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.229> set<00:06:11.470> this<00:06:11.770> piece<00:06:12.070> of

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
this is just going to set this piece of

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.770 
this is just going to set this piece of
redstone<00:06:12.370> right<00:06:12.789> here<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.449> a<00:06:13.479> piece<00:06:13.750> of

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
redstone right here and to a piece of

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.879 
redstone right here and to a piece of
air<00:06:14.229> that<00:06:14.560> disables<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.400> particles<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.889> it

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
air that disables the particles and it

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.159 
air that disables the particles and it
kind<00:06:18.099> of<00:06:18.159> gives<00:06:18.250> it<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.550> illusion<00:06:18.970> that<00:06:19.169> the

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
kind of gives it the illusion that the

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.420 
kind of gives it the illusion that the
that<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.130> UM<00:06:22.289> that<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.620> particles<00:06:24.070> kind<00:06:24.310> of

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
that the UM that the particles kind of

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.800 
that the UM that the particles kind of
faded<00:06:24.699> away<00:06:24.820> and<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.060> portals<00:06:25.419> shut<00:06:25.659> off

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
faded away and the portals shut off

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.719 
faded away and the portals shut off
because<00:06:26.500> you've<00:06:26.680> blinded<00:06:26.889> both<00:06:27.370> of<00:06:27.610> these

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
because you've blinded both of these

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.260 
because you've blinded both of these
guards<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.889> oops<00:06:29.889> let<00:06:30.460> me<00:06:30.580> just<00:06:30.789> lay<00:06:31.240> down

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
guards and oops let me just lay down

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.890 
guards and oops let me just lay down
another<00:06:31.690> one<00:06:31.870> of<00:06:31.990> these<00:06:33.000> you'll<00:06:34.000> see<00:06:34.270> all<00:06:34.510> all

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
another one of these you'll see all all

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.790 
another one of these you'll see all all
these<00:06:35.409> iron<00:06:36.039> doors<00:06:36.490> disappeared<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:37.440> so<00:06:38.440> now

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
these iron doors disappeared and so now

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.010 
these iron doors disappeared and so now
for<00:06:38.979> the<00:06:39.070> escape<00:06:39.370> manual<00:06:39.669> this<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.479> a<00:06:40.510> trap

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
for the escape manual this is a trap

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.320 
for the escape manual this is a trap
chest<00:06:41.380> right<00:06:41.590> here<00:06:41.620> and<00:06:42.130> if<00:06:42.400> I<00:06:42.490> just<00:06:42.669> break

behind<00:06:43.810> it<00:06:43.990> you<00:06:44.530> can<00:06:44.680> see<00:06:44.860> we<00:06:45.039> have<00:06:45.070> one

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
behind it you can see we have one

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.610 
behind it you can see we have one
command<00:06:45.820> block<00:06:46.030> and<00:06:46.300> it<00:06:46.750> is<00:06:46.930> just<00:06:47.289> to<00:06:47.409> fill

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
command block and it is just to fill
