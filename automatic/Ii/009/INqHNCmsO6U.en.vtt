00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
would plus seven against the Giants I
thought<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> would<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> nice<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.400> would<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thought it would be a nice it would be a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.890 
thought it would be a nice it would be a
very<00:01:38.729> close<00:01:39.180> game<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> pretty

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
very close game and it was a pretty

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
very close game and it was a pretty
sloppy<00:01:40.259> game<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> Giants<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.369> Giants

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
sloppy game for the Giants the Giants

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880 
sloppy game for the Giants the Giants
have<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:41.880> major<00:01:42.150> problems<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.990> special<00:01:43.680> teams

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
Giants at home I think they're going to
go<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> fourth<00:01:49.320> game<00:01:49.670> winning<00:01:50.670> streak
