00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
think this is about eight dollars which

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.450 
think this is about eight dollars which
i<00:05:10.170> think<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.410> really<00:05:10.560> really<00:05:10.770> cheap<00:05:11.010> I'm

wearing at my place today and it gives a

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.140 
wearing at my place today and it gives a
medium<00:05:13.440> coverage<00:05:13.800> which<00:05:14.250> i'm<00:05:14.430> liking<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150

next<00:05:15.480> thing<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.660> picked<00:05:16.020> up<00:05:16.170> was<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.950> room

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
next thing I picked up was the room

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.730 
next thing I picked up was the room
London<00:05:17.850> wake<00:05:18.210> me<00:05:18.510> concealer<00:05:19.170> in<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.530> color

London wake me concealer in the color
ivory<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.480> sounds<00:05:21.720> just<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.990> really<00:05:22.380> light

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
ivory and it sounds just a really light

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.320 
ivory and it sounds just a really light
one<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:22.980> i<00:05:23.250> just<00:05:23.430> thought<00:05:23.610> i<00:05:23.640> put<00:05:23.940> under<00:05:24.210> my

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
one so i just thought i put under my

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.570 
one so i just thought i put under my
eyes<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.810> brighten<00:05:25.200> them<00:05:25.530> up<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.980> hyper<00:05:26.310> only

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
eyes to brighten them up and hyper only

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.120 
eyes to brighten them up and hyper only
uses<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:26.940> bit<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.450> honestly<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.170> makes<00:05:28.380> you

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
uses a bit and honestly it makes you

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.520 
uses a bit and honestly it makes you
feel<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.610> mean<00:05:29.880> look<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:30.420> much<00:05:30.600> more<00:05:30.660> awake<00:05:31.230> and

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
feel I mean look so much more awake and

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.170 
feel I mean look so much more awake and
I<00:05:31.860> think<00:05:32.160> that's<00:05:32.310> definitely<00:05:32.520> something<00:05:32.940> I'm

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
I think that's definitely something I'm

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.820 
I think that's definitely something I'm
gonna<00:05:33.330> be<00:05:33.510> needing<00:05:33.840> for<00:05:34.200> those<00:05:34.350> days<00:05:34.590> where

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
gonna be needing for those days where

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.310 
gonna be needing for those days where
I'm<00:05:34.890> gonna<00:05:34.980> be<00:05:35.070> cramming<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.850> stuff<00:05:36.090> so<00:05:36.420> some

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
I'm gonna be cramming and stuff so some

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.690 
I'm gonna be cramming and stuff so some
of<00:05:37.350> that<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.590> then<00:05:37.800> picked<00:05:38.040> up<00:05:38.160> two<00:05:38.400> things<00:05:38.640> that

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
of that I then picked up two things that

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.000 
of that I then picked up two things that
aren't<00:05:39.300> really<00:05:39.420> necessary<00:05:39.750> for<00:05:40.200> uni<00:05:40.620> but<00:05:40.830> I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
aren't really necessary for uni but I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.740 
aren't really necessary for uni but I
pick<00:05:41.190> them<00:05:41.310> up<00:05:41.400> anyway<00:05:41.640> but<00:05:42.300> this<00:05:42.420> is<00:05:42.630> the

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
pick them up anyway but this is the

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.080 
pick them up anyway but this is the
Rimmel<00:05:43.110> match<00:05:43.320> perfection<00:05:43.680> bronzing<00:05:44.490> powder

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
Rimmel match perfection bronzing powder

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.330 
Rimmel match perfection bronzing powder
and<00:05:45.600> this<00:05:46.170> looks<00:05:46.350> like<00:05:46.500> that<00:05:46.770> it's<00:05:47.040> just<00:05:47.190> your

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
and this looks like that it's just your

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.790 
and this looks like that it's just your
normal<00:05:47.670> bronze<00:05:48.120> it's<00:05:48.690> got<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:49.110> little<00:05:49.530> bit<00:05:49.710> of

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
normal bronze it's got a little bit of

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.580 
normal bronze it's got a little bit of
shimmer<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.250> it<00:05:50.400> but<00:05:50.580> it's<00:05:50.700> more<00:05:50.910> Matt<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.720> would

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
shimmer to it but it's more Matt I would

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.290 
shimmer to it but it's more Matt I would
say<00:05:52.710> a<00:05:52.740> rather<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.220> shimmery<00:05:53.610> it's<00:05:54.150> not

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
say a rather the shimmery it's not

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.910 
say a rather the shimmery it's not
completely<00:05:54.870> matte<00:05:55.290> but<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.530> just<00:05:55.740> thought<00:05:55.860> that

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
completely matte but I just thought that

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.160 
completely matte but I just thought that
would<00:05:56.280> be<00:05:56.310> good<00:05:56.550> for<00:05:56.790> contouring<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.570> during

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
would be good for contouring and during

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.050 
would be good for contouring and during
the<00:05:58.350> time<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:58.860> now<00:05:59.250> in<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.460> early<00:05:59.700> months<00:05:59.820> i'm
