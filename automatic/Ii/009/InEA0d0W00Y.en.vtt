 coca crops and that of this group that 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.210
 is neither more nor less than the group let's say 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.039
 the biggest drug cartel that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.800
 there are in the world the farc and right now 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.620

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.370
 the narco Timoshenko will 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.630
 they lifted 110-120 arrest warrants and 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.700
 It is strutting between Caracas and havana 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.650
 mountains of colombia where has the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.750
 largest drug trafficking business that 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.660
 there are in the world and where they murder 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.540
 kidnap flip makes recruitment 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.280
 of minors puts anti-personnel mines is 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.800
 a tragedy what happens to colombia 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.870
 with this that has ridden Juan Manuel 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.930
 saints - privileging a handful of 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.430
 gangsters and 78 thousand peasants who 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.830
 they recruited by force and today they want 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.530
 kneeling to 47 million Colombians 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.840
 it's a great tragedy while 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.460
 persecutes the opposition permanently 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.680
 that democratically has support 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.680
 majority in this country now 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.860
 exactly will be 118 capture orders 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.660
 they are like a person responsible for 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.920
 multiple crimes among which 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.750
 find as you have quoted 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.330
 some is also homicide 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.330
 aggravated kidnapping extortive rebellion 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.820
 terrorism as it is allowed to leave the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.610
 country as it is allowed to reach the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.490
 habana as you are allowed to give your your 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.070
 opinion on this peace process that already 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.290
 quite uncomfortable has a certain part 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.510
 of the Colombian population the fact of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.270
 who sits in one at a table and you're 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 listen to the requests that are 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.800
 making the terrorists of the farc 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.230
 Juan Manuel Santos laugh at the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.330
 narcoterrorists of the FARC because they 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.150
 he promised the Colombians that he had 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.550
 signed that peace process and if what 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.680
 we reelected him because he would be 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.720
 solved this problem with the narco 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.420
 terrorist of the part then of hostage 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.580
 of them because it does exactly what 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.370
 the affable if it is a sadness because 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.530
 the FARC do not represent any sector 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.840
 of the Colombian people is why the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.820
 called the international community to 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.090
 the most serious thing that is happening in 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.250
 colombia a president hostage of the group 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.010
 greatest narcoterrorist there is in the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.990
 world the third most terrorist group 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.240
 rich in the world and the most 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.810
 big drug cartel a 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.540
 kneeling president and hostage this 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.160
 narco-terrorist group when every 47 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.530
 millions of Colombians worried 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.600
 we see how we have been subjected to all 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.760
 these privileges that they have given to the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.820
 narcoterrorists of the farc and goes by 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.910
 very bad way the nation not in vain the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.830
 surveys talk about support in less 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.350
 from 30 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.140
 management of Juan Manuel Santos all 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.330
 product of this great deception this evil 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.420
 called the peace process where they are 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.920
 giving a lousy message not only to the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.200
 Colombian nation to young people 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.600
 Colombians be a terrorist and 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.760
 drug trafficker do that is what he 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.220
 privileged Colombia well and let's say that 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.680
 that is doing a very serious damage to 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.110
 this nation and that's why the concern of 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
 us and the call we make to the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.310
 international community to the agencies 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.110
 international so that they take care 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.080
 about the tragedy that is living 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.000
 Colombia with the merit that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.160
 is doing juan manuel santos al 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.650
 peace narcoterrorism senator for 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.940
 many sectors of the opposition this 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.350
 represents another concession to the group 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.269
 terrorist of the FARC as you have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 said he has qualified the president 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.700
 saints even as a hostage of the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.200
 narco-terrorists but for others who 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.090
 they show a little more optimistic with 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.980
 these peace dialogues is a sign of 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.180
 that these dialogues are in their stage 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.490
 end what part are as headquarters 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 performed 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.930
 but let's say there is not a single sample 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.479
 of the will of peace of the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.840
 narcoterroristas of the farc all the 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.270
 Colombians we want peace peace is a 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.740
 fundamental value of the human being and what 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.289
 They seem to have played with that word 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.090
 because they have made 47 believe here 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.380
 millions of Colombians who signing 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.840
 something in Havana, the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.310
 problems of Colombians by God 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.610
 these are democracy here there is not a 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.160
 rising of a group that has the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.319
 support from civil society against a 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.110
 dictatorship this is a democracy that with 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.150
 all difficulties has advanced but 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.340
 agua manuel saints it occurred to him that 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.560
 everything was to sign something with the 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.539
 narcoterrorists I neither hostage of them not 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.120
 there is only one sign of will for peace 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.060
 in the narco-terrorists of the farc all 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.610
 otherwise permanent crimes have 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.130
 increased the production of cocaine the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.319
 last data talks about 40 percent 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.960
 more of crops and with this that just 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.060
 pass where Juan Manuel Santo hostage 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.759
 las farc has suspended publications 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.889
 with glyphosate that is the only thing that can 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.330
 control the cocaine crops 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.870
 as the procurator said 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.449
 in action in this country the next six 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.919
 months we will be washing in cocaine is 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.110
 a tragedy what is happening to 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.300
 Colombia with all the privileges that 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.530
 are being given to narco-terrorism
