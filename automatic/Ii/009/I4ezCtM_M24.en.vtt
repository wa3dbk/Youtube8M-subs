00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello everybody now but let's see how dear our have changed the size of a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.469
 object of scene 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.699
 some baby manipulations 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.800
 leaves a little bit in order for you to have an exact notion of how cheese 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.929
 problem was able to spoil and objects because 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.060
 so come on 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.220
 this object that you also be born my body is that standard object because 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.269
 already appears in the scene right away when you start blender 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.120
 we'll fill this object a little bit for this that will put us in the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.770
 Canberra view by pressing the 0 key you will do politics you will 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.530
 clearer movement that will make us with this object is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.950
 manipulations 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.990
 come on 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.150
 first let's change the size of this object 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
 if you hit the perfect key 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.340
 moves towards chile 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.620
 you see that kraft object and decreases the increase is only moves with the side 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.280
 north right he comments leap left 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 until the moment that they hit you by choice by entering mudge they have decreased 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.160
 in reality the more you move away from the world central movement 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.330
 until the next owl session that it decreases 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.760
 if the setrans pass next to the other side it increases again except direction 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.220
 being the object of an inquiry the mother what is unusual that this morning 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.350
 click with the button I will say everything left mouse left forgiveness 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.509
 and it keeps 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.090
 the size you chose is like this 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.390
 I grew a little 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.730
 left-click does not also have to choose what you want 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.620
 that he 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.130
 I'm going back to center 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.200
 object cent direction 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.060
 r click here left button and it does not have size 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.730
 chosen 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.400
 this is the command to increase or decrease the shape object. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 global now we are going to increase the object 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.939
 toward kisses xix and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.780
 event 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.039
 many first stopped in kick 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.020
 and I fear that this vlt attention presses the key f 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.390
 followed by the letter y 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.189
 the duct to cleidson 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.340
 while moving mawston 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.999
 he is walking 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.859
 holder of the saints will fulfill 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.969
 if you tighten up case 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.409
 f again 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.529
 eo and 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.649
 and back to the size more or less says it was a cube 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.619
 the same key is that following up to sort 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.090
 moving 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.000
 Indians of this sense downtown of Rio de Janeiro everything he will come 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 rectangle on this resignation 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.719
 came back is finally fuels 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.099
 towards the center held france have the format yes it was a cube 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.559
 Let's build a building now. 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.489
 the letter f followed by the leader letter 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.719
 and it makes movement 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.689
 up growth see only 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.219
 he turned an object 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.869
 similar to a building 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.949
 What I have is that again with the goalkeeper 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.459
 a beast 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.859
 It's okay, this more or less 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.889
 wanted to show in terms of 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.259
 movement 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.579
 using the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.980
 is that simply how did he grow up great-grandson and then followed by lep 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.589
 button 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.909
 stay connected in Chile keep an event of that format 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.889
 chased and xix 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 he wants the sides of the strait is not 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.360
 following the key 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.329
 left mouse click 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.949
 I marked that format 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.329
 if you put whoever this is followed by the singer, this is not going to do 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.489
 Good afternoon, see you there. 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 left button it stays that size 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.529
 It is made 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.879
 event 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.839
 and makes kills wider 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.059
 watch 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.409
 topeka 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.930
 moving lou 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.439
 jumped from me 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.609
 besides this moment that I'm making you sure 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.249
 the central button of the evil of tight in it makes a rigid movement of routine 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.609
 mobile you change any side the camera screen 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.719
 always holding 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.979
 the middle key of the movement that she sewed 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.159
 and then the school happens he goes away 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.259
 let's go to the next 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.110
 so that the cut is clear 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.409
 center of the model is widely used in kramer applications 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.469
 pet up clavero book that can initial 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.559
 or even finish 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.840
 the frontal mission 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.430
 7 topix view is with the prediction lula federal the fame ours but the owner 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.919
 that the clear 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.590
 but decreased because the size that works well xi 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.009
 it's not sea 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.199
 A little lower is not our part. 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.559
 this is where I wanted to show the use of chaib key indicated 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.219
 size loop 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.699
 what is personal thanks 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.930
 not next 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.960
 tutors and students, let's study a little bit like 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.729
 does everyone already have to change the ways what I had in command the latter is 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.710
 a new command made a local clinic
