the<00:00:35.579> reverse<00:00:36.149> light<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.670> there's

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
the reverse light thing that if there's

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.590 
the reverse light thing that if there's
the<00:00:39.120> crankshaft<00:00:39.510> position<00:00:39.870> sensor<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> thing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the crankshaft position sensor the thing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
the crankshaft position sensor the thing
that<00:00:42.720> I<00:00:42.750> couldn't<00:00:43.079> find<00:00:43.290> searching<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that I couldn't find searching on the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
that I couldn't find searching on the
internet<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.429> day<00:00:44.609> for<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.879> week<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.420> said<00:00:45.960> can

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
internet all day for a week I said can

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.060 
internet all day for a week I said can
have<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.000> it's<00:00:48.000> broken<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.769> I'll

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
have one but it's broken so I think I'll

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
have one but it's broken so I think I'll
just<00:00:50.250> um<00:00:51.289> cut<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.589> piece<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> plastic

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
just um cut off this piece of plastic

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
just um cut off this piece of plastic
here<00:00:53.429> and<00:00:54.260> electrical<00:00:55.260> tape<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> other

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
here and electrical tape up to the other

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.500 
here and electrical tape up to the other
one<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.019> right<00:00:58.109> one

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
one if it's the right one

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.440 
one if it's the right one
so<00:01:00.510> anyways<00:01:00.809> yeah<00:01:01.019> here's<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> new<00:01:01.499> shifter

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.070 

this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> old<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> old<00:01:09.690> one<00:01:09.900> went

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
this is the old one the old one went

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.950 
this is the old one the old one went
something<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.560 

a<00:01:20.049> little<00:01:20.560> bit<00:01:20.680> dusty

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.460 

but<00:01:24.170> turns<00:01:24.380> great<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:26.690> think<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.380> little

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
but turns great I think it's a little

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.969 
but turns great I think it's a little
more<00:01:27.650> flimsy<00:01:27.979> than<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.430> used<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.790> be<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:31.030> mean<00:01:32.030> I

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
more flimsy than it used to be I mean I

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.840 
more flimsy than it used to be I mean I
gotta<00:01:33.979> have<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.160> get<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> new<00:01:34.490> one<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.760> those

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
gotta have to get a new one of those

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.250 
gotta have to get a new one of those
balls<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.390> think<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.990> goes<00:01:36.170> inside<00:01:36.500> there<00:01:38.260> one

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
balls I think that goes inside there one

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.940 
balls I think that goes inside there one
of<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.440> night<00:01:39.650> I<00:01:40.040> think<00:01:40.940> still<00:01:41.240> works<00:01:43.270> third

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
of the night I think still works third

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:55.060 
of the night I think still works third
fourth<00:01:45.950> fifth<00:01:48.190> gear<00:01:51.280> reverse<00:01:53.920> angles<00:01:54.920> are

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
fourth fifth gear reverse angles are

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.279 
fourth fifth gear reverse angles are
nice<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.400> perfect<00:01:58.360> here<00:01:59.360> one<00:01:59.600> it's<00:02:00.110> almost

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
nice and perfect here one it's almost

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.340 
nice and perfect here one it's almost
straight<00:02:01.210> no<00:02:02.210> chance<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.780> accidentally

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
straight no chance of it accidentally
