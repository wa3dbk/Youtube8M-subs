a gear high wide ratio transmission so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330 
a gear high wide ratio transmission so
it's<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.630> even<00:02:43.750> ideally<00:02:44.290> suited<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:44.920> the

as<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:05.380> race<00:04:05.590> bike

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
as the race bike

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.420 
as the race bike
and<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.640> weighs<00:04:06.850> more<00:04:07.180> than<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.540> race<00:04:07.690> bike<00:04:08.170> so

out<00:04:11.290> because<00:04:12.180> 32<00:04:13.180> different<00:04:13.330> classes<00:04:13.900> bike

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
out because 32 different classes bike

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.310 
out because 32 different classes bike
rotate<00:04:15.700> owners<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.900> thing<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.230> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
rotate owners and that thing is a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.990 
rotate owners and that thing is a
monster<00:04:17.350> compared<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.670> thing<00:04:18.880> is

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
monster compared to this this thing is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.030 
monster compared to this this thing is
like<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> pussycat<00:04:19.660> in<00:04:20.079> comparison<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:20.859> then

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
like a pussycat in comparison and then

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.180 
like a pussycat in comparison and then
this<00:04:21.489> thing<00:04:21.760> did<00:04:22.180> five<00:04:23.050> six<00:04:23.470> seconds<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:24.040> lap

quicker<00:04:24.250> than<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> Aprilia<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.500> these<00:04:27.340> things

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
quicker than the Aprilia so these things

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.000 
quicker than the Aprilia so these things
don't<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:27.910> compare<00:04:28.360> but<00:04:29.080> both<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.680> them

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010
