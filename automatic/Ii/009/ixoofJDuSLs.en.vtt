00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.510
 Small steel in Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.119
 It is 1959 that we started operation in town Noshiro city of wood 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.270
 A company that specializes in the design and manufacture of wood processing machines and automatic labor-saving machines 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.269
 Results of meeting all user needs 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.269
 This leads to also have your rights to patent 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 It can be said that flexible and large number of technical powers support steel in the province 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:09.070
 Keisei 21 year president of Shonai had a request from a construction company in Noshiro City 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.790
 When we want to make board of house building materials using rice husk 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 It was 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.890
 It is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.180
 I also fix big with this, but 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.320
 Cherry blossoms are also handmade a little 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.710
 I 'm getting lobs like this 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 Buddha whether Hey do not Ikeda to eat with oak wood 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 Cosmetic one if 4+ or not say the problem is whether Sukaffure information 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.439
 It can not be improved 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.720
 The more interesting material is discarded from the day 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.720
 Trial and error of Shonai began 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:00.600
 It was the unexpected was a strong repulsive force with the chaff itself 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.600
 I think the compression method and the adhesive are the points 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:21.439
 I was satisfied with the success of the rice husk board by the prototype 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.430
 First of all, what about the technology of the press of that original future? 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:30.319
 After all that 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:35.280
 In our night of tier was Irasshai with a high degree of technology, such as not Look at that example to other 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:40.819
 I will come to the woman who asked me this way 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.819
 I think the Fu say that I wish it was the president's who in the making close 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.370
 2010 parrot lost 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.740
 Rice husk eco board with excellent tearability is patented 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.740
 The production line is also patent pending 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:10.980
 Also it called a batch with a production system to that press in a mold die 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:17.970
 I decided to go with the batch production method, but 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.990
 It seems that the production amount is already decided with one mold by all means 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.200
 For example Well 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.650
 I think probably not Japan, but 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:33.140
 If Kana is Well Anou while pressing the two molds 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:39.709
 Back to automatically until it put given the chaff This Well repeated this an expensive form 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:46.909
 Round-and-round blue wandering makes it possible to increase production efficiency as much as possible 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:47.670
 It is said that the Maruha member of this time that I thought a little 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.510
 Layer of machine 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.510
 It sounds too good to be 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.310
 wh 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:06.720
 Making Well Speaking of making things if Well the old days 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.140
 Now that that China and the fact that the production of those cheap good to say so to product production 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.990
 Or 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:18.030
 It was possible to be done in such a country and go down from now on 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.030
 I think we should be headed to make this create imagine 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:39.510
 Expect body and head first 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:43.100
 So let's start making things from Akita etc. 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.260
 think global open and local 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.260
 Let's aim at glocal entry
