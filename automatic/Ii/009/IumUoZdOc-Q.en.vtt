00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
that it didn't try out my mouth and it

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.670 
that it didn't try out my mouth and it
was<00:02:45.640> quite<00:02:45.880> moisturizing<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:47.050> lips<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
was quite moisturizing to lips and it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.460 
was quite moisturizing to lips and it
gave<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.040> brilliant<00:02:49.440> pigmentation<00:02:50.440> and

wish they had more shades this is shade
5<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.910> dark<00:03:16.270> shade<00:03:16.750> oh<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.910> guess<00:03:18.910> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
5 and this is dark shade oh I guess the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.820 
5 and this is dark shade oh I guess the
only<00:03:19.270> negative<00:03:19.959> about<00:03:20.200> their<00:03:20.380> products<00:03:20.709> is

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
only negative about their products is

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.280 
only negative about their products is
that<00:03:21.010> their<00:03:21.160> packaging<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.030> quite<00:03:22.270> flimsy<00:03:22.600> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
that their packaging is quite flimsy and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.490 
that their packaging is quite flimsy and
the<00:03:24.160> palette<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.670> easily<00:03:25.540> broken<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.290> guess

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the palette is easily broken but I guess

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.260 
the palette is easily broken but I guess
that's<00:03:26.530> what<00:03:26.860> you're<00:03:26.980> paying<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.370> your<00:03:28.060> paper

product<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.260> not<00:03:29.440> really<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.860> packaging<00:03:30.370> so

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
product and not really the packaging so

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.310 
product and not really the packaging so

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
I don't really mind that the packaging

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.560 
I don't really mind that the packaging
falls<00:03:32.560> apart<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.250> it's<00:03:34.240> not<00:03:34.390> very
