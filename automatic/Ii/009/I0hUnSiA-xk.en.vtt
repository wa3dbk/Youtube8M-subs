00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello today you are the beginning and the end of the beginning 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.590
 August 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.469
 here I will present you what ideas I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.250
 stole from the Romanians and Russian made such 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.260
 the last 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.240
 last generation well swore for 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.380
 mating magician well that's how they all 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.380
 this cover 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 now now take a closer look like this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:44.660
 called feeder trough is how she 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:48.590
 standing on top like this is covered with a film 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.090
 here they come bees out 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.600
 plank so they floated 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.140
 but so open the film and give and rub a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.470
 then sometimes of course ants come up with 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.520
 it is hard to fight 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.150
 that's where we are located 3 frames 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.570
 small length of this top bar 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.940
 frames one hundred fifty six millimeters 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.350
 if you multiply these one hundred fifty six 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.190
 mm 3 then it turns out 468 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.310
 just about the length 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.200
 which frame has normally that is from 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.020
 of these three frames we collect one frame 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.530
 just docked together now I am you 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.550
 will show 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 using a zigzag 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:51.910
 device framed that time under can 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.530
 it turns out so long well why am I 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.140
 wanted to make such a long and narrow 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.340
 frame because in small volume 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 bees and easier to group and create 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 such a warm climate 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.670
 take these two frames means one 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.930
 side of the frame rests on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.459
 hive shoulder on the wall on the other hand 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.890
 such a thing is put 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.220
 2 frame is placed on this side as 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.580
 continuation on the other hand 2 frames 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 this tablet is put again 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.630
 and already 3 frame 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:40.280
 becomes next to the second frame so on 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:44.440
 this tablet and here it becomes already on 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.239
 shoulder rests on the wall of the hive like this and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.970
 so in such a way in such a way of mine 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:55.819
 we put a superstructure into the warehouse after 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.769
 blooming gardens for rape 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.600
 we have a plantation of rapeseed for color 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.819
 We ask to immunity after their bees 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.590
 rebuild this we brood already sow 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.220
 and together with the flow it is desirable her immediately 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 take so as not to cut the brood trying 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.440
 there to push into this frame and well, and so the whole 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 further down there you can see there it is not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.250
 Now you do not wait 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:33.290
 then do not like the feeder is very comfortable 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.950
 top down there you can see it is harmful there 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.829
 lattice with such a lattice practically 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.260
 kiss all the bottom open i'll be so and even 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:49.549
 and wintering it allows you to get rid 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.030
 moisture is very good from moisture 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.660
 from there it's already a proven price method 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.640
 it's worth it all summer and all winter 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.590
 if necessary, you can take there 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.549
 polystyrene long piece to the whole 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.069
 on all this 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.040
 on this whole nucleus under the bottom put and 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.480
 all of these holes will close for example 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.269
 handling you rockets yes yes yes amide unless 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.019
 do not know what is in Russia and Romania 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:26.139
 called you rockets when set fire to these 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:31.610
 fuse one more thing here i'm 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:34.370
 calculated thus these volumes 44 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.020
 volume what if you pull out all of this 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.060
 nucleus can be put frame 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.690
 pillars and at this moment the forest for example for 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.200
 give us a creation otvodka or to catch 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.380
 swarm 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.130
 but it is not very justified itself because 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.199
 which is very very tight this framework 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.050
 not enough for them a place is me here by 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.380
 mine did 35 or even thirty four 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.300
 millimeter wide framed urn 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.660
 not enough places so from this idea 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.280
 I will not get rid of I will do universal 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.650
 so the light of the nucleus and yes make just for 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 mating uterus 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.470
 but when you look at the second frame 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.470
 then there is 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.550
 here already once under probably you and here 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.740
 and the womb of Nuk Nuk Nuk Nuk here it is 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:41.810
 she is beautiful 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.810
 neighbors run away here's another 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:57.990
 and there articles slutty on video 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.990
 thread when it is 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.949
 Here is a brief all 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.520
 Where 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:08.940
 Well, here's another quick show 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.860
 zigzag device which 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:19.860
 it becomes so to frame on they they here 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:25.050
 these edges leaning on the neighboring 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:32.750
 the framework that is hanging on between the ordinary 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.750
 frames everywhere hang these mount all
