 and prepares his end of career 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.330
 but he decided to deform a duet with the young in order to be able to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.400
 quietly finish his career still enjoys a little public 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.720
 wider a little more juvenile so I finally ended up his career 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 slowly 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.630
 on the ground ten people 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.350
 pending the answer to participate in the poll 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.400
 so I have to say that is that I have to respect the law of discrimination 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.440
 positive in France that makes me obliged to hire a young person 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.350
 difficulty that has not yet succeeded in integrating the professionals of the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.950
 music 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.539
 it is a track in the capital of niger they seek in the province I have 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.530
 wrong to find it the long time

 for that she herself 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.420
 the two French have a good time and that means 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.469
 people like the great composer of the 20th century 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.330
 m the musical culture you already have that brought us this surplus 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.140
 housing to start his disagreement 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.850
 you were a lot of things estimated on Saturday that m france has not for me 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.850
 it is the synthesis of all the visits of the 20th century 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.299
 the world 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.069
 the visit to canada and the opportunity to hear their interpretations of 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.189
 several classics 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.349
 but also to discover their original compositions 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.979
 really original 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.679
 for example this musical version of the account the frog of the fable of the 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.629
 fountain good good good 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.890
 the world 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.639
 but for me 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.699
 it is not so 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.189
 the day here is the little bit I think what is written the party 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.419
 and two of them relative to each other we pass 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.200
 we also have a little game of Gaulle 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.609
 he was in the alps last week we're at home this week 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.349
 in a context of hardware by all cars a little extreme 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.089
 post office that promise us a lot of music dumas men 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.089
 jazz far from serious 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.999
 our activists 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.309

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.650

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.420
 jean-pierre le gauche 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.830

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.329
 between bets and the voice with only 20 years tournament 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.990
 delays in the army for his tenderness his track 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.259
 der standard and again this humor 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.999
