concrete specifically what this is is is
to<00:00:13.840> create<00:00:13.990> an<00:00:14.259> HCl<00:00:14.710> so<00:00:14.920> we're<00:00:15.040> gonna<00:00:15.160> get<00:00:15.280> a

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
to create an HCl so we're gonna get a

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.670 
to create an HCl so we're gonna get a
little<00:00:15.490> into<00:00:15.790> just<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.570> raw<00:00:16.779> material<00:00:17.349> some

big proponents of creatine monohydrate

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.220 
big proponents of creatine monohydrate
because<00:00:26.470> it's<00:00:26.800> cheap<00:00:27.099> it<00:00:27.699> works<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.930> best

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
because it's cheap it works and the best

explain<00:00:37.750> briefly<00:00:37.930> what<00:00:38.350> creates<00:00:38.710> in<00:00:38.860> HCl<00:00:39.400> is<00:00:39.610> a

explain briefly what creates in HCl is a

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.180 
explain briefly what creates in HCl is a
creatine<00:00:40.269> HCl<00:00:40.659> is<00:00:40.780> just<00:00:40.930> creatine<00:00:41.470> bonded<00:00:42.070> to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
creatine HCl is just creatine bonded to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.439 
creatine HCl is just creatine bonded to
hydrochloric<00:00:42.760> acid<00:00:43.150> or<00:00:43.360> HCL<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:45.250> guess<00:00:46.030> from

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
hydrochloric acid or HCL I guess from

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.359 
hydrochloric acid or HCL I guess from
what<00:00:46.540> I'm<00:00:46.780> reading<00:00:47.049> they<00:00:47.739> did<00:00:47.949> that<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.250> make

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:48.369 
what I'm reading they did that to make

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:50.789 
what I'm reading they did that to make
it<00:00:48.430> more<00:00:48.580> soluble<00:00:49.269> in<00:00:49.510> water<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:50.379> allow<00:00:50.619> it<00:00:50.769> to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
it more soluble in water to allow it to

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.439 
it more soluble in water to allow it to
be<00:00:50.949> absorbed<00:00:51.809> better<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:54.299> confusing<00:00:55.299> thing

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
be absorbed better the confusing thing

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.119 
be absorbed better the confusing thing
about<00:00:55.479> it<00:00:55.809> is<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.110> you're<00:00:56.260> actually<00:00:56.379> bonding

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
about it is is you're actually bonding

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.500 
about it is is you're actually bonding
it<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.400> an<00:00:57.489> acid<00:00:58.229> and<00:00:59.610> very<00:01:00.610> strong<00:01:00.970> acid<00:01:01.479> and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
it to an acid and very strong acid and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.240 
it to an acid and very strong acid and
their<00:01:01.720> idea<00:01:02.049> is<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.379> they're<00:01:02.920> gonna<00:01:03.010> lower

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
their idea is that they're gonna lower

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.359 
their idea is that they're gonna lower
the<00:01:03.460> ph<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.000> your<00:01:04.180> intestines<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.799> by<00:01:06.010> doing

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
the ph and your intestines but by doing

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.000 
the ph and your intestines but by doing
so<00:01:06.580> most<00:01:07.030> times<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:08.200> know<00:01:08.320> when<00:01:08.440> creatine

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
so most times you know when creatine

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.980 
so most times you know when creatine
monohydrate<00:01:09.220> ends<00:01:09.640> enters<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.210> stomach

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
monohydrate ends enters your stomach

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.620 
monohydrate ends enters your stomach
acid<00:01:11.550> some<00:01:12.550> of<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.730> does<00:01:12.850> get<00:01:13.030> broken<00:01:13.240> down<00:01:13.360> in

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
acid some of it does get broken down in

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.110 
acid some of it does get broken down in
Korea<00:01:13.960> into<00:01:14.290> creatinine<00:01:14.860> well<00:01:15.460> when<00:01:15.610> your<00:01:15.730> pH

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
Korea into creatinine well when your pH

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.230 
Korea into creatinine well when your pH
is<00:01:16.150> going<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.510> be<00:01:16.600> lowered<00:01:18.240> hypothetically

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
is going to be lowered hypothetically

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.850 
is going to be lowered hypothetically
more<00:01:19.870> of<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.080> creatine<00:01:20.470> should<00:01:20.710> be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
more of this creatine should be

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.340 
more of this creatine should be
converted<00:01:21.340> into<00:01:21.460> correct<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.030> also<00:01:22.290> okay<00:01:23.290> so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
converted into correct and also okay so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.800 
converted into correct and also okay so
but<00:01:24.310> are<00:01:24.400> there<00:01:24.520> any<00:01:24.550> problems<00:01:25.180> with<00:01:25.390> creatine

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
but are there any problems with creatine

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.420 
but are there any problems with creatine
monohydrate<00:01:26.050> now<00:01:26.500> I've<00:01:26.770> never<00:01:26.980> read<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.310> I've

study<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.409> show<00:01:50.620> creatine<00:01:51.070> hydrochloride

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
study to show creatine hydrochloride

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.860 
study to show creatine hydrochloride
versus<00:01:51.909> creatine<00:01:52.300> monohydrate

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
versus creatine monohydrate

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.590 
versus creatine monohydrate
and<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:54.100> venture<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.760> guess<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.180> they<00:01:55.330> did

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
and I venture to guess that if they did

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.180 
and I venture to guess that if they did
they'd<00:01:55.810> still<00:01:56.080> find<00:01:56.290> increase<00:01:56.620> in<00:01:56.770> menageries

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
they'd still find increase in menageries

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.000 
they'd still find increase in menageries
but<00:01:57.340> yeah<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.729> think<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.570> case<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.799> Creed<00:01:59.799> in

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
but yeah I think it's a case of Creed in

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.289 
but yeah I think it's a case of Creed in
being<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.220> really<00:02:00.430> good<00:02:00.549> supplement<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.210> then

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
being a really good supplement and then

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.820 
being a really good supplement and then
I<00:02:01.330> think<00:02:01.540> people<00:02:01.659> trying<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> create<00:02:02.530> another

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
I think people trying to create another

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.770 
I think people trying to create another
form<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.520> make<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.790> seem<00:02:03.940> better<00:02:04.210> you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
form of it to make it seem better you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.210 
form of it to make it seem better you
know<00:02:04.870> they're<00:02:05.020> they're<00:02:05.290> recommending<00:02:05.920> here

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
know they're they're recommending here

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.339 
know they're they're recommending here
to<00:02:06.729> take<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.210> supplement<00:02:07.600> one<00:02:07.750> hour<00:02:07.900> prior<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
to take the supplement one hour prior to

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.550 
to take the supplement one hour prior to
training<00:02:09.239> well<00:02:10.239> with<00:02:10.390> pre<00:02:10.599> attend

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
training well with pre attend

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.050 
training well with pre attend
you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.099> take<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.430> primary<00:02:12.790> train<00:02:12.970> it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you can take this primary train it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.490 
you can take this primary train it
doesn't<00:02:13.239> really<00:02:13.330> matter<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:14.050> not<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.380> it's

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
doesn't really matter it's not so it's

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.020 
doesn't really matter it's not so it's
not<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> nervous<00:02:15.010> system<00:02:15.310> stimulant<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.910> not

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
not a nervous system stimulant it's not

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.790 
not a nervous system stimulant it's not
something<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.390> take<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.750> oh<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.410> feel<00:02:17.620> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
something you take it oh and you feel it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.920 
something you take it oh and you feel it
it's<00:02:17.980> got<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.130> build<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.360> your<00:02:19.480> systems

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
it's got to build up into your systems

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's got to build up into your systems
and<00:02:20.140> build<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:20.590> muscles<00:02:20.890> usually

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and build up in your muscles usually

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.880 
and build up in your muscles usually
takes<00:02:21.430> three<00:02:21.670> four<00:02:21.880> or<00:02:21.970> five<00:02:22.090> days<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.050> it's

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
takes three four or five days so it's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.290 
takes three four or five days so it's
really<00:02:24.130> irrelevant<00:02:24.400> when<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> take<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.209> I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
really irrelevant when you take it I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.309 
really irrelevant when you take it I
mean<00:02:25.390> there's<00:02:25.599> been<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:25.870> people<00:02:25.989> say<00:02:26.260> you

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
mean there's been some people say you

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.540 
mean there's been some people say you
need<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.500> take<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> post-workout<00:02:27.250> when<00:02:27.459> your

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
need to take a post-workout when your

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.520 
need to take a post-workout when your
insulin<00:02:27.760> sensitivity<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.720> increased<00:02:28.750> with

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
insulin sensitivity is increased with

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.870 
insulin sensitivity is increased with
carbohydrates<00:02:30.190> you've<00:02:30.489> been<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> little

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
carbohydrates you've been a little

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.110 
carbohydrates you've been a little
better<00:02:30.940> absorption<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:32.010> taking<00:02:33.060> taking<00:02:34.060> this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
better absorption but taking taking this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.570 
better absorption but taking taking this
one<00:02:34.330> hour<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.800> know<00:02:35.920> before<00:02:36.220> your<00:02:36.310> workout

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
one hour you know before your workout

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.830 
one hour you know before your workout
really<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.569> more<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really is I think it's more of a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.900 
really is I think it's more of a
marketing<00:02:38.230> thing<00:02:38.260> than<00:02:38.530> anything<00:02:38.910> and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
marketing thing than anything and

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.670 
marketing thing than anything and
they're<00:02:40.390> serving<00:02:40.630> size<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:41.170> more<00:02:41.530> through

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
they're serving size with more through

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
they're serving size with more through
the<00:02:41.739> serving<00:02:42.040> size<00:02:42.220> really<00:02:42.670> yeah<00:02:43.000> per<00:02:43.510> capsule

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
the serving size really yeah per capsule

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.990 
the serving size really yeah per capsule
it<00:02:44.290> says<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.650> capsule<00:02:45.160> per<00:02:45.220> hundred<00:02:45.700> pounds

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
it says one capsule per hundred pounds

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.539 
it says one capsule per hundred pounds
of<00:02:46.090> body<00:02:46.239> weight<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.769> if<00:02:48.040> you're<00:02:48.190> 200<00:02:48.519> pounds

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
of body weight so if you're 200 pounds

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.270 
of body weight so if you're 200 pounds
is<00:02:48.910> two<00:02:49.060> capsules<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:49.660> each<00:02:49.840> capsule<00:02:50.280> 750

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
is two capsules but each capsule 750

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.759 
is two capsules but each capsule 750
milligrams<00:02:51.549> which<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.930> terms<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.319> creatine<00:02:53.560> is

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
milligrams which in terms of creatine is

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.410 
milligrams which in terms of creatine is
a<00:02:53.830> relatively<00:02:54.190> low<00:02:54.430> dosage<00:02:54.880> yeah<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.209> think<00:02:55.299> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
a relatively low dosage yeah I think I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.059 
a relatively low dosage yeah I think I
went<00:02:55.480> about<00:02:55.690> 3<00:02:55.959> grams<00:02:56.290> yeah<00:02:56.709> let's<00:02:56.950> just

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
went about 3 grams yeah let's just

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.670 
went about 3 grams yeah let's just
assume<00:02:57.760> you're<00:02:57.970> at<00:02:58.120> least<00:02:58.269> 150<00:02:59.110> pounds<00:02:59.560> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
assume you're at least 150 pounds I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.250 
assume you're at least 150 pounds I
think<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.130> know<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.400> good<00:03:01.080> benchmark<00:03:02.080> to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
think you know that's good benchmark to

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.690 
think you know that's good benchmark to
start<00:03:02.560> at<00:03:02.830> least<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.220> know<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.430> creatine

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
start at least you know with creatine

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.250 
start at least you know with creatine
monohydrate<00:03:03.849> again<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:04.750> don't<00:03:04.840> know<00:03:04.989> what<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
monohydrate again we don't know what the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.860 
monohydrate again we don't know what the
dosage<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.069> based<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.519> there<00:03:07.269> may<00:03:07.420> very<00:03:07.450> well

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
dosage is based on there may very well

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.330 
dosage is based on there may very well
be<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:08.650> we're<00:03:08.769> open<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.280> don't

be you know we're open to it I don't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.550 
be you know we're open to it I don't
really<00:03:09.519> see<00:03:09.730> anything<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.180> I'm<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
know third party university research

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.240 
know third party university research
that's<00:03:13.590> peer-reviewed<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.830> can<00:03:15.010> find

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
that's peer-reviewed that I can find

now create some atomizer work so I'll
you<00:03:20.260> know<00:03:20.320> kind<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.980> question<00:03:21.310> like<00:03:21.400> I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
you know kind of the question like I

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.780 
you know kind of the question like I
said<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.790> comes<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> me<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.299> why<00:03:22.750> yeah<00:03:23.350> there

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
said that comes to me is why yeah there

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
said that comes to me is why yeah there
I<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.299> reading<00:03:25.630> something<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:26.109> bottle

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
I was just reading something on a bottle

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.199 
I was just reading something on a bottle
it<00:03:26.590> says<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.069> it's<00:03:27.370> been<00:03:27.519> reportedly<00:03:28.000> shown

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
it says that it's been reportedly shown

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.349 
it says that it's been reportedly shown
to<00:03:28.359> have<00:03:28.480> at<00:03:28.660> least<00:03:28.690> 59<00:03:29.230> times<00:03:29.650> greater<00:03:30.359> water

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
to have at least 59 times greater water

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.380 
to have at least 59 times greater water
solubility<00:03:31.870> than<00:03:32.380> creatine<00:03:32.859> monohydrate<00:03:33.390> so

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
solubility than creatine monohydrate so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.059 
solubility than creatine monohydrate so
it<00:03:35.109> seems<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.500> they're<00:03:35.620> trying<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.920> do

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
it seems like they're trying to do

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.140 
it seems like they're trying to do
something<00:03:36.100> here<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.609> making<00:03:36.819> it<00:03:36.970> more

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
something here with making it more

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.289 
something here with making it more
soluble<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.630> water<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:39.030> really<00:03:40.030> didn't<00:03:40.239> think

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
soluble in water I really didn't think

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.340 
soluble in water I really didn't think
that<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.630> was<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> problem<00:03:40.989> either

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
that that was a problem either

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.500 
that that was a problem either
I<00:03:41.500> don't<00:03:41.799> it's<00:03:42.280> not<00:03:42.519> an<00:03:42.639> issue<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.389> know

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
I don't it's not an issue just you know

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.960 
I don't it's not an issue just you know
use<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> little<00:03:44.109> more<00:03:44.170> water<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:45.700> would<00:03:45.790> be

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
use a little more water that would be

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.640 
use a little more water that would be
you<00:03:46.750> know<00:03:46.840> one<00:03:47.019> thing<00:03:47.230> if<00:03:47.380> you're<00:03:47.530> worried

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
you know one thing if you're worried

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.330 
you know one thing if you're worried
about<00:03:47.709> that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
about that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.340 
about that
you<00:03:48.940> know<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.180> no<00:03:49.299> loading<00:03:49.569> no<00:03:49.870> loading<00:03:50.200> those

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you know the no loading no loading those

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.379 
you know the no loading no loading those
that<00:03:50.950> stands<00:03:51.459> true<00:03:51.819> with<00:03:52.060> creatine

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
that stands true with creatine

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.210 
that stands true with creatine

no<00:03:54.609> cycling<00:03:55.120> well<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.540> can<00:03:55.690> say<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.019> about

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
no cycling well you can say that about

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.199 
no cycling well you can say that about
any<00:03:56.230> creatine<00:03:56.739> because<00:03:56.920> your<00:03:57.040> body<00:03:57.250> not<00:03:58.000> only

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
any creatine because your body not only

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.849 
any creatine because your body not only
do<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.389> produce<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.930> endogenously<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.739> also

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
do you produce it endogenously but also

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.470 
do you produce it endogenously but also
you<00:04:00.040> get<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.310> from<00:04:00.400> exogenous<00:04:00.670> sources<00:04:01.299> so

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
you get it from exogenous sources so

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.030 
you get it from exogenous sources so
it's<00:04:01.900> not<00:04:02.079> like<00:04:02.290> testosterone<00:04:02.470> when<00:04:02.950> your

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it's not like testosterone when your

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.789 
it's not like testosterone when your
body<00:04:03.190> shuts<00:04:03.400> down<00:04:03.609> production<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.260> then<00:04:05.500> you

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
body shuts down production and then you

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.530 
body shuts down production and then you
know<00:04:05.889> no<00:04:06.100> side<00:04:06.370> effects<00:04:06.700> cramping<00:04:07.269> bloating

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
know no side effects cramping bloating

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660 
know no side effects cramping bloating

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
water retention or GI issues that's

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.789 
water retention or GI issues that's
hyperbole<00:04:10.329> also<00:04:10.810> about<00:04:11.109> Rita<00:04:11.380> mono

from it you know a lot of that if you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.249 
from it you know a lot of that if you
drink<00:04:25.330> enough<00:04:25.539> water<00:04:25.719> you're<00:04:25.960> not<00:04:25.990> gonna<00:04:26.169> have

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.499 
drink enough water you're not gonna have
to<00:04:26.319> worry<00:04:26.469> about<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.300> true

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
to worry about that and it's just true

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.939 
to worry about that and it's just true
although<00:04:28.960> yeah<00:04:29.439> all<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.740> time

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
although yeah all the time

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.649 
although yeah all the time
and<00:04:30.310> we've<00:04:30.520> discussed<00:04:30.879> in<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> past<00:04:31.300> with<00:04:31.509> the

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
and we've discussed in the past with the

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.300 
and we've discussed in the past with the
bloating<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.289> things<00:04:32.439> like<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.800> that's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
bloating and things like that that's

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.339 
bloating and things like that that's
when<00:04:33.580> people<00:04:33.729> are<00:04:33.969> taking<00:04:34.120> creatine<00:04:34.659> with<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
when people are taking creatine with the

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.589 
when people are taking creatine with the
75<00:04:35.949> grams<00:04:36.219> of<00:04:36.340> sugar<00:04:36.550> sure<00:04:36.939> that<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.479> of

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
75 grams of sugar sure that you of

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.760 
75 grams of sugar sure that you of
course<00:04:37.840> you're<00:04:37.960> gonna<00:04:38.050> get<00:04:38.229> bloated<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.650> some

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
course you're gonna get bloated and some

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.140 
course you're gonna get bloated and some
of<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:38.949> work<00:04:39.099> loading<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.699> at<00:04:39.849> four<00:04:40.030> or<00:04:40.090> five

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
of the work loading it at four or five

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.360 
of the work loading it at four or five
Hyundai<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.139> think<00:04:41.620> that'll<00:04:42.099> blow<00:04:42.250> up

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
Hyundai so I think that'll blow up

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.179 
Hyundai so I think that'll blow up
anybody<00:04:42.849> creatine<00:04:43.539> you<00:04:44.110> want<00:04:44.439> it<00:04:44.560> drawn<00:04:44.919> into

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
anybody creatine you want it drawn into

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.469 
anybody creatine you want it drawn into
the<00:04:45.280> cell<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.490> water<00:04:45.819> drawn<00:04:46.030> into<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.270> cell

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
the cell the water drawn into the cell

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.360 
the cell the water drawn into the cell
hyper<00:04:46.990> hydrates<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.590> muscle<00:04:47.889> cell<00:04:48.009> let<00:04:48.189> that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
hyper hydrates the muscle cell let that

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.070 
hyper hydrates the muscle cell let that
actually<00:04:48.729> makes<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.240> cell<00:04:49.449> more<00:04:49.569> anabolic

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
actually makes the cell more anabolic

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.230 
actually makes the cell more anabolic
you<00:04:50.229> know<00:04:50.349> that's<00:04:50.560> that's<00:04:50.919> one<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.819> main

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
you know that's that's one of the main

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.700 
you know that's that's one of the main
effects<00:04:52.539> of<00:04:52.629> it<00:04:52.719> it's<00:04:52.840> not<00:04:52.960> subcutaneous

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
effects of it it's not subcutaneous

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.339 
effects of it it's not subcutaneous
fluid<00:04:54.099> beneath<00:04:54.669> your<00:04:54.789> skin<00:04:54.969> like<00:04:55.240> sodium<00:04:56.169> it's

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
fluid beneath your skin like sodium it's

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.920 
fluid beneath your skin like sodium it's
not<00:04:56.439> the<00:04:56.529> extracellular<00:04:56.830> water<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.930> that's

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
not the extracellular water so that's

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.089 
not the extracellular water so that's
really<00:04:59.229> not<00:04:59.349> something<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.710> worry<00:04:59.740> about<00:04:59.919> I

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
really not something to worry about I

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.730 
really not something to worry about I
mean<00:05:00.370> bottom<00:05:01.060> line<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.620> companies<00:05:02.620> are

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
mean bottom line is companies are

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.959 
mean bottom line is companies are
putting<00:05:02.889> this<00:05:03.069> in<00:05:03.219> products<00:05:03.639> you<00:05:03.819> know<00:05:03.909> I

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
putting this in products you know I

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.219 
putting this in products you know I
think<00:05:04.449> GNC<00:05:05.080> puts<00:05:05.319> in<00:05:05.439> amplifying<00:05:06.129> you<00:05:07.110> can<00:05:08.110> use

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
think GNC puts in amplifying you can use

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.570 
think GNC puts in amplifying you can use
create<00:05:08.590> but<00:05:08.710> there's<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.949> fraction<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.460> the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
create but there's a fraction of the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.969 
create but there's a fraction of the
cost<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.629> works<00:05:10.840> all<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.409> research<00:05:11.770> says

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
cost and it works all the research says

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.879 
cost and it works all the research says
that<00:05:12.009> it<00:05:12.189> works<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:12.870> yeah<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:13.900> don't<00:05:14.199> if<00:05:14.740> you

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
that it works so yeah I don't if you

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.939 
that it works so yeah I don't if you
have<00:05:14.979> good<00:05:15.159> reason<00:05:16.469> say<00:05:17.469> you<00:05:17.529> stick<00:05:17.800> with

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
have good reason say you stick with

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.459 
have good reason say you stick with
creatine<00:05:18.279> monohydrate<00:05:18.610> it's<00:05:19.029> it's

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
creatine monohydrate it's it's

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.779 
creatine monohydrate it's it's
inexpensive<00:05:20.469> and<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.800> works<00:05:21.009> yeah<00:05:21.490> if

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
inexpensive and it works yeah if

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.339 
inexpensive and it works yeah if
something<00:05:22.150> comes<00:05:22.449> out<00:05:22.629> you<00:05:22.810> know<00:05:22.930> we'll<00:05:23.139> be

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
something comes out you know we'll be

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.689 
something comes out you know we'll be
more<00:05:23.469> than<00:05:23.560> happy<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.830> update<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.219> video<00:05:24.310> as

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
more than happy to update the video as

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.360 
more than happy to update the video as
far<00:05:24.879> as<00:05:25.000> research<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:25.680> they've<00:05:26.680> got<00:05:26.889> a<00:05:26.919> long

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
far as research but they've got a long

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.769 
far as research but they've got a long
way<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.580> go<00:05:27.819> considering<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.449> amount<00:05:28.690> of

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
way to go considering the amount of

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.999 
way to go considering the amount of
research<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.169> currently<00:05:29.650> out<00:05:29.710> there<00:05:29.919> with

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
research that's currently out there with

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.670 
research that's currently out there with
creatine<00:05:30.339> monohydrate<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.900> just<00:05:32.529> how

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
creatine monohydrate and just how

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.909 
creatine monohydrate and just how
effective<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.279> is<00:05:33.779> so<00:05:34.779> yeah<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.319> if<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.800> guys
