00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.720
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.279
 like a cold coffee drink with her 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.710
 to prepare German Gusto Piccolo 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.690
 could be the big advantage to german 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.000
 In fact, the guste system is that they both 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.090
 to prepare heat as well as cold drinks 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.090
 can 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.660
 I am preparing for this fredo today 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.590
 cappuccino we shall see cold 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.840
 to be prepared 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.290
 First, an ice cube in a glass 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.410
 then add the milk and finally 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.860
 the coffee on top of it we'll see 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.379
 how the whole thing works the pack 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.300
 costs 4 euro 50 so that's eight 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.800
 Drinks are possible since eight again 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.399
 Capsules for the milk do not need a way 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 once with the ice cubes in the glass 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.730
 to do 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:11.860
 You should start here with three pieces 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.780
 the milk as you can see are only 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.759
 gray capsules that then the cafÃ© where 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 We'll start with both of them 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.490
 insert milk cat once 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.900
 the plus here this time conclude the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 Do not push to the right that we are in 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.909
 warm drinks but left for 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.909
 cold drinks 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.140
 milk is already coming out of here 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.140
 machine is how cold 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:59.450
 so be 180 milliliters once 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.780
 stop capsule out and the other one 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.660
 coffee capsules the machine for the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.230
 coffee net finally close again and 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.230
 again to the left 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.960
 so again I have to manually again 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.820
 stop and turn off the coffee pods again 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.470
 the machine 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.060
 the drops are something like that again 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.460
 unfortunately always here with the Germans 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 Gasten capsules is the case and at the 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.880
 piccolo still the disadvantage that they 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.090
 no container for the empty ones 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.620
 coffee capsules has the drink is now 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 cool 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.500
 that means also cold drinks can with 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.950
 The piccolo should be prepared 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.970
 but leave a little bit there 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.030
 the ice cubes all the while now 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.490
 little temperature against that means that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.040
 cool the drink and down a bit 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.480
 also tastes very good the fed 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.520
 because the coffee capsule is not that sweet 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.570
 that means there is really little here 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 sugar in it's as simple as that 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.590
 Preparation of the flow with the German 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.709
 gusto piccolo I have more drinks 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.030
 prepared in other youtube videos 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.220
 entire test report on the machine 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 you can even turn left on mine 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.610
 side capsule - coffee dot net a lot 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.610
