will discuss in greater detail later on

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
will discuss in greater detail later on
is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.820> fact<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> q1<00:01:03.899> ultra<00:01:04.409> mobile

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is the fact that the q1 ultra mobile

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
is the fact that the q1 ultra mobile
laptop<00:01:05.880> computer<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.810> very

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
laptop computer and one of my very

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
laptop computer and one of my very
favorite<00:01:07.830> points<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.270> computer<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
favorite points about this computer is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.810 
favorite points about this computer is
that<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.310> front<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.590> back<00:01:15.020> camera<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
that it has a front and back camera and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
that it has a front and back camera and
so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> mount<00:01:18.390> also<00:01:19.080> allows<00:01:19.830> accessibility

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so the mount also allows accessibility

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.780 
so the mount also allows accessibility
to<00:01:21.659> both<00:01:22.140> cameras<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> front<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> back

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
to both cameras the front and back

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.440 
to both cameras the front and back
camera<00:01:24.270> both<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> them<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.960> exposed<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:26.450> use

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
camera both of them are exposed for use

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.359 
camera both of them are exposed for use
if<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:29.640> needed<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:31.130> have<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> video<00:01:32.610> conference

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
if one needed to have a video conference

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.050 
if one needed to have a video conference
or<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.689> photographs<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.549> take<00:01:38.820> video

of<00:01:40.009> images<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.420> other<00:01:42.689> side<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
of images that are on the other side of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.249 
of images that are on the other side of
the<00:01:44.040> computer<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:46.020> addition<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:48.299> bracket

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the computer in addition the bracket

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.330 
the computer in addition the bracket
also<00:01:49.500> allows<00:01:50.369> accessibility<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.340> stylus

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
also allows accessibility to the stylus

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.899 
also allows accessibility to the stylus
which<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.369> pulls<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.610> right

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
which I really do like pulls out right

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.560 
which I really do like pulls out right
there<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.909> then<00:01:59.909> it<00:01:59.939> goes<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
there and then it goes back in the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.990 
there and then it goes back in the
bottom<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.650> computer<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.670> tones

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
bottom of the computer and it's tones

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.590 
bottom of the computer and it's tones
there<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:06.440> can<00:02:06.680> access<00:02:07.160> that<00:02:07.430> while<00:02:08.150> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
there and I can access that while the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.000 
there and I can access that while the
computer<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.620> in<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.880> bracket<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.800> will

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
computer is in the bracket so we will

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.510 
computer is in the bracket so we will
come<00:02:16.250> back<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:17.200> provide<00:02:18.200> greater<00:02:18.740> detail<00:02:19.190> of
