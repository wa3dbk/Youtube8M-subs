00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.619
 as they are going to be learning to read in the camera of the common 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.099
 it gives me because we're going on fire 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.900
 this part above 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.890
 who claimed that the screen 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.999
 and I'm talking this part distance rigor 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.390
 and that part 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.199
 sd then the drought and the drought we are against 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 good information very important you will see the different strings 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.400
 bab the aziziya and also spend watching 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.040
 have in mind that there are some cute photos assigned to different accounts 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.510
 you can see with an x 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.440
 ojÃº stephan may well see 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 usero 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.800
 the x designate means then that that couple 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.070
 when a private 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.020
 you do not have to listen to it with what we're doing in court 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.290
 lara the zero 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.620
 Olympus 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.230
 uu how 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.270
 is he andy so much if he remembers 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.210
 look down they are giving 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.410
 even though he does not want a finger assigned on the accordion he still must 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 be 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 very well and then now let's talk 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.630
 hundreds of the part 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.370
 right 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.230
 of the diagram the court 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.870
 and you will find that in this part you ' 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.100
 of the diagram some knots 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.900
 and that's good means in the trash number 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.159
 where you just need to place the Hispanic events on the cover to form this note 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 will continue to grow exponentially bouquets 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 in a bottom part of the diagram 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.659
 you will see that there are some letters assigned to basin 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.030
 and those letters 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 they are nothing more and nothing less than the notes of that string when they are 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.540
 open so that when we do not have an assigned land rings 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.179
 and then I would have dollar from his not not left so right 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.319
 the letter 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.369
 this letter corresponds 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.750
 the station saw 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.969
 and this is the sixth rope as the youngest rope 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.279
 in their life 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.310
 and it keeps moving towards 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.499
 so your rate your right 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.319
 you will be seeing then that the next letter is an actress has 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.269
 corresponded as late 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.409
 the rest correspond to his letters d and that 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.709
 is the law corresponds to notice r 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.120
 and successively the agent corresponds to the note of the sun 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.949
 wing the letter d 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.089
 corresponds to taxi 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.799
 and finally a 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.590
 ee lowercase and that is to create 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.799
 we can understand 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.079
 the difference I understood in the tapes that rope that 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.989
 in a thicker tone 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 in contract link and lower case which is a more acute sound than the sixth 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.189
 then 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.639
 of numbering - the bad guys 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.709
 you will see that every time twice by the hand- you have an assigned number 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.649
 d 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:24.559
 and if we pass then to the pink bouquet Jorge Esteva will vote 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.789
 what in his already spent the costumes 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.269
 to them 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.029
 some buttons with one less and those buttons 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.649
 means then you are going to place 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:39.429
 that model in that trance and on that string 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.469
 as an example if we want to do everything well the greatest 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.119
 It is your first possession as an investment 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.829
 we would have to place 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.179
 March 2001 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.139
 while number 2 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.139
 on the rope 1 4 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.559
 from here and if we want to be excessively the finger of one all 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:02.460
 and day 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.139
 in that fret world 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.229
 In nothing 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.069
 third string and rounding 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.930
 of interest is also worthy fret 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.709
 in the second round 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.429
 and that's how we can then 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.529
 understand 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.409
 chords diagram 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.569
 I hope you are learning 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.759
