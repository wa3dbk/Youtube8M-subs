hard towards that in New York is the
biggest<00:03:54.540> step<00:03:54.750> towards<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.260> not<00:03:55.860> towards

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
biggest step towards that not towards

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.980 
biggest step towards that not towards
that<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.460> think<00:03:56.700> New<00:03:56.790> York<00:03:56.970> has<00:03:57.120> done<00:03:57.150> done<00:03:57.840> me<00:03:57.959> a
