van will be on build number i think

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.889 
van will be on build number i think
today<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.899> seven<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:35.450> everything<00:00:36.450> i<00:00:36.540> did<00:00:36.600> on

the bed on the inside will be seven be

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
the bed on the inside will be seven be
that<00:00:40.770> way<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> build<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> complete<00:00:42.140> you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that way when the build is complete you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840 
that way when the build is complete you
can<00:00:43.170> match<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> builds<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.640> together

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
can match all of the builds up together

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.529 
can match all of the builds up together
and<00:00:45.860> make<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> complete<00:00:47.399> instructional<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and make a complete instructional out of

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.300 
and make a complete instructional out of
it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.330 

here<00:00:51.910> we<00:00:52.060> are<00:00:52.240> set<00:00:52.540> up<00:00:52.720> for<00:00:53.220> making<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.310> bed

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
here we are set up for making the bed

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.560 
here we are set up for making the bed
frame<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.560> make<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.100> bed<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.850> kind<00:00:58.330> of<00:00:58.480> like

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
frame way I make the bed is kind of like

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.240 
frame way I make the bed is kind of like
a<00:00:58.630> sled<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.670> two<00:01:01.060> rails<00:01:01.480> on<00:01:01.990> either<00:01:02.890> side

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
a sled I have two rails on either side

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.660 
a sled I have two rails on either side
of<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.520> wheel<00:01:03.760> wells<00:01:04.380> screw<00:01:05.380> down<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:06.550> the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
of the wheel wells screw down to the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.780 
of the wheel wells screw down to the
sheet<00:01:06.910> metal<00:01:07.090> floor<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:09.040> across<00:01:09.460> those

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
sheet metal floor then across those

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.450 
sheet metal floor then across those
rails<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.600> lay<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.460> bed<00:01:12.670> crossmembers<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:15.100> i'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
rails I lay the bed crossmembers so i'm

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.700 
rails I lay the bed crossmembers so i'm
going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.670> make<00:01:15.850> those<00:01:16.060> rails<00:01:16.420> now

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.100 

these<00:01:21.370> rails<00:01:21.700> also<00:01:22.180> determine<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.869> height<00:01:23.049> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
these rails also determine the height of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.570 
these rails also determine the height of
the<00:01:23.350> bed<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:25.260> we'll<00:01:26.260> once<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.710> high<00:01:27.190> as<00:01:27.400> low

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
the bed and we'll once that high as low

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.920 
the bed and we'll once that high as low
as<00:01:27.729> he<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.450> could<00:01:28.600> sit<00:01:28.810> up

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
as he can get so it could sit up

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.590 
as he can get so it could sit up
comfortably<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.890> his<00:01:30.100> bed<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:31.270> what's<00:01:31.420> going

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
comfortably in his bed so what's going

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.130 
comfortably in his bed so what's going
to<00:01:31.630> dictate<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:33.070> height<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.670> bed<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.150> the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
to dictate the height of this bed is the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.649 
to dictate the height of this bed is the
water<00:01:35.380> tank<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:36.369> got<00:01:36.549> out<00:01:36.700> 15<00:01:37.150> gallon<00:01:37.540> water

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
water tank it's got out 15 gallon water

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.800 
water tank it's got out 15 gallon water
tank<00:01:37.840> which<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.350> 12<00:01:38.860> inches<00:01:38.979> tall<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.300> his<00:01:40.540> bed

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
tank which is 12 inches tall so his bed

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.110 
tank which is 12 inches tall so his bed
will<00:01:41.259> have<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.860> be<00:01:41.979> over<00:01:42.399> 12<00:01:42.700> inches<00:01:42.850> tall

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.500 

there's<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.080> uprights<00:01:47.590> for<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.950> bed<00:01:48.420> part<00:01:49.420> of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
there's the uprights for the bed part of

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.860 
there's the uprights for the bed part of
all<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.690> is<00:01:49.930> knowing<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.090> make

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
all this is knowing what to make

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.940 
all this is knowing what to make
permanent<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.970> make<00:01:55.120> removable

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
permanent and what to make removable

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610 
permanent and what to make removable
because<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.310> your<00:01:57.490> own<00:01:57.640> build<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.380> can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
because this is your own build you can

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.650 
because this is your own build you can
look<00:01:59.770> into<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.130> future<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.550> see<00:02:01.180> what<00:02:01.480> things

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
look into the future and see what things

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.540 
look into the future and see what things
might<00:02:01.990> give<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.560> problems<00:02:02.830> where<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.430> would

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
might give you problems where you would

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.590 
might give you problems where you would
like<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.970> make<00:02:04.120> repairs<00:02:04.540> or<00:02:04.840> changes<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:07.060> when

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
like to make repairs or changes so when

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.230 
like to make repairs or changes so when
it<00:02:07.750> comes<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.350> wood<00:02:08.800> glue<00:02:09.570> for<00:02:10.570> these<00:02:10.720> uprights

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
it comes to wood glue for these uprights

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.640 
it comes to wood glue for these uprights
wood<00:02:13.240> glue<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.630> actually<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.550> stronger<00:02:15.550> bond<00:02:15.820> as

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
wood glue is actually a stronger bond as

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
wood glue is actually a stronger bond as
the<00:02:17.650> wood<00:02:17.860> itself<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.790> done<00:02:19.150> properly<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the wood itself if done properly so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.360 
the wood itself if done properly so
these<00:02:22.660> rails<00:02:23.050> will<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.470> glued<00:02:23.740> they'll<00:02:24.340> be

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
these rails will be glued they'll be

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.440 
these rails will be glued they'll be
permanent<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.340> slats<00:02:27.670> across<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.210> top

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
permanent but the slats across the top

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.980 
permanent but the slats across the top
that<00:02:29.050> actually<00:02:29.590> hold<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> bed<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.340> place<00:02:30.990> will

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
that actually hold the bed in place will

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.380 
that actually hold the bed in place will
be<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.380> screwed<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.670> way<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> bed

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
be just screwed on that way if the bed

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.850 
be just screwed on that way if the bed
ever<00:02:34.600> needs<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.020> get<00:02:35.170> taken<00:02:35.410> out<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
ever needs to get taken out in the

future you just unscrew the top remove

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.700 
future you just unscrew the top remove
the<00:02:39.280> rails<00:02:39.520> easy<00:02:40.330> peasy<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.820> your<00:02:43.090> build

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the rails easy peasy so it's your build

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.800 
the rails easy peasy so it's your build
build<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.130> easily<00:02:45.610> repairable<00:02:48.810> have

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
build it to be easily repairable have

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.020 
build it to be easily repairable have
you<00:02:49.930> ever<00:02:50.110> been<00:02:52.440> drilling<00:02:53.880> putting<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> screw

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you ever been drilling putting a screw

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.330 
you ever been drilling putting a screw
on<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.570> end<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.989> board<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.620> splits<00:02:57.160> open

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
on the end of a board and it splits open

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.720 
on the end of a board and it splits open
on<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:59.220> the<00:03:00.220> reason<00:03:00.550> why<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.850> happens<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
on you the reason why that happens it's

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.650 
on you the reason why that happens it's
the<00:03:03.940> top<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.450> screw<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> wedge<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the top of the screw is like a wedge and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.790 
the top of the screw is like a wedge and
it<00:03:08.290> splits<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.830> open<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:10.230> if<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.350> take<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
it splits it open so if you take the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.479 
it splits it open so if you take the
extra<00:03:12.100> time<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.000> do<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.450> step<00:03:13.750> properly

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
extra time and do this step properly

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.470 
extra time and do this step properly
your<00:03:15.489> number<00:03:15.820> Ten's<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.910> number<00:03:19.090> 10

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
your number Ten's that's a number 10

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.780 
your number Ten's that's a number 10
countersink<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.650> see<00:03:20.920> how<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.340> got<00:03:21.580> that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
countersink you see how it's got that

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.440 
countersink you see how it's got that
taper<00:03:22.150> at<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.630> end<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.220> won't<00:03:24.400> have<00:03:24.730> that's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
taper at the end you won't have that's

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.009 
taper at the end you won't have that's
splitting<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.250> take<00:03:28.090> your<00:03:28.300> time<00:03:28.360> because

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
splitting so take your time because

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.430 
splitting so take your time because
doing<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.500> quick<00:03:29.739> allows<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.670> twice

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
doing it quick allows you to do it twice

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
doing it quick allows you to do it twice
slow<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.650> quick

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.729 

that's<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.769> countersink<00:03:41.280> looks<00:03:41.519> like

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
that's what the countersink looks like

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.710 
that's what the countersink looks like
so<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.890> head<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.250> will<00:03:45.120> fit<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.510> there

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
so the head of that will fit in there

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.910 
so the head of that will fit in there
and<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.319> split<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.830> wood<00:03:46.950> open<00:03:47.870> now<00:03:48.890> well<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and not split the wood open now well I

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.110 
and not split the wood open now well I
put<00:03:50.129> these<00:03:50.250> rails<00:03:50.549> up<00:03:52.670> because<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:53.790> working

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
put these rails up because I'm working

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.649 
put these rails up because I'm working
by<00:03:54.239> myself<00:03:54.269> right<00:03:54.900> now<00:03:56.299> still<00:03:57.299> trying<00:03:57.599> to

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
that'll help me get its square you know

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.779 
that'll help me get its square you know
that<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.449> just<00:04:21.479> holding<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.199> place<00:04:22.789> so

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
now I got a hold of it level for me to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.760 
now I got a hold of it level for me to
get<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.760> where<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.820> needs<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.120> be<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.560> I'll

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
get that where it needs to be and I'll

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.810 
get that where it needs to be and I'll
glue<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.580> screw<00:04:33.300> it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.970 

it<00:04:38.450> comes<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.960> wood<00:04:39.110> glue<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.470> don't<00:04:39.680> need

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
it comes to wood glue you don't need

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.730 
it comes to wood glue you don't need
much<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:41.470> want<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.560> little<00:04:42.800> thin<00:04:43.340> layer<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.530> it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
much you want a little thin layer and it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.500 
much you want a little thin layer and it
will<00:04:45.830> spread<00:04:46.130> out<00:04:48.340> there<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.610> go<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:50.330> all<00:04:50.390> you

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
will spread out there we go so all you

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.380 
will spread out there we go so all you
need

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.860 

there<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.700> look<00:04:58.700> how<00:04:58.880> close<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.420> got<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.780> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
there it is look how close I got to the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.300 
there it is look how close I got to the
edge<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.170> board<00:05:01.330> no<00:05:02.330> splits<00:05:04.360> all<00:05:05.360> right

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
edge of that board no splits all right

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.100 
edge of that board no splits all right
now<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.340> just<00:05:07.490> flip<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.090> over<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.540> put<00:05:08.990> the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
now I just flip it over and put the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.040 
now I just flip it over and put the
bottom<00:05:09.410> part<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.800> realm<00:05:10.360> is<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
bottom part of the realm is the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
bottom part of the realm is the
completed<00:05:12.530> bed<00:05:12.920> rail<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:15.110> it's<00:05:15.380> just<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.800> half

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
completed bed rail and it's just a half

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.280 
completed bed rail and it's just a half
inch<00:05:16.310> taller<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:20.000> way<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.810> don't<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:21.050> any

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
inch taller that way you don't have any

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.500 
inch taller that way you don't have any
rubbing<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:22.700> don't<00:05:22.820> want<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.000> rub<00:05:23.120> all<00:05:23.390> on

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
rubbing you don't want to rub all on

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.670 
rubbing you don't want to rub all on
this<00:05:23.630> tank<00:05:24.670> but<00:05:26.140> that's<00:05:27.140> how<00:05:27.260> it's<00:05:27.440> going<00:05:27.590> to

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
this tank but that's how it's going to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.000 
this tank but that's how it's going to
sit<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.220> this<00:05:28.400> will<00:05:28.550> go<00:05:28.670> along<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.180> wheel<00:05:29.390> well

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
sit so this will go along the wheel well

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.210 
sit so this will go along the wheel well
thank<00:05:31.010> was<00:05:31.250> this<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.700> how<00:05:31.820> wide<00:05:32.090> his<00:05:32.300> bettis

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
thank was this is how wide his bettis

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.350 
thank was this is how wide his bettis
and<00:05:34.220> then<00:05:35.350> across<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.410> top<00:05:37.000> will<00:05:38.000> be<00:05:38.120> rails

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
and then across the top will be rails

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.200 
and then across the top will be rails
like<00:05:38.660> this<00:05:39.160> would<00:05:40.160> a<00:05:40.190> sheet<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.490> plywood<00:05:40.730> on<00:05:41.000> it

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
like this would a sheet of plywood on it
