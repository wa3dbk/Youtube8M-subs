00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
are addressed in each of the in each of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.249 
are addressed in each of the in each of
the<00:02:05.939> lesson<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.539> like<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> said<00:02:06.869> things<00:02:07.200> like

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the lesson so like I said things like

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.339 
the lesson so like I said things like
teamwork<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.190> respect<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> thing

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
teamwork and and respect the good thing

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
teamwork and and respect the good thing
about<00:02:10.500> I'll<00:02:10.830> suppose<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> students<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
about I'll suppose that the students can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.000 
about I'll suppose that the students can
then<00:02:11.879> take<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.860> incorporate<00:02:13.860> into

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
then take those and incorporate into

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.589 
then take those and incorporate into
their<00:02:14.340> reign<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> their<00:02:14.910> daily<00:02:15.030> school<00:02:15.390> lives

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
their reign to their daily school lives

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.619 
their reign to their daily school lives

as well look I mean different students

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.380 
as well look I mean different students
benefit<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.049> different<00:02:19.709> ways<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:21.239> over

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
benefit in different ways you know over

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
benefit in different ways you know over
the<00:02:21.480> last<00:02:21.540> couple<00:02:21.810> years<00:02:21.959> like<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.260> said<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.500> try

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the last couple years like I said we try

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.100 
the last couple years like I said we try
to<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.129> range<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.670> students<00:02:24.030> some<00:02:24.239> students

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
to get a range of students some students

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.619 
to get a range of students some students
that<00:02:25.140> might<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.730> slightly<00:02:26.730> disconnected<00:02:27.420> from

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
that might be slightly disconnected from

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.449 
that might be slightly disconnected from
the<00:02:28.049> normal<00:02:28.410> school<00:02:28.590> environment<00:02:29.190> once<00:02:29.340> we

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the normal school environment once we

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.059 
the normal school environment once we
put<00:02:29.640> them<00:02:29.760> into<00:02:29.910> something<00:02:30.599> different<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.890> I

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
put them into something different as I

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.740 
put them into something different as I
said<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.549> sort<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:33.000> dirt<00:02:33.180> sort<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.540> gives

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
said it it sort of in dirt sort of gives

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.240 
said it it sort of in dirt sort of gives
them<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> different<00:02:34.440> reason<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.010> come<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
them a different reason to come to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.920 
them a different reason to come to
school<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.819> helps<00:02:36.420> connect<00:02:36.690> them<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
school and helps connect them to the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.170 
school and helps connect them to the
school<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> little<00:02:37.380> bit<00:02:37.560> better<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.640> know<00:02:38.970> some

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
school a little bit better you know some

those sorts of situations but the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.570 
those sorts of situations but the
benefit<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.320> this<00:04:20.440> program<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.890> suppose<00:04:21.280> it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
benefit of this program I suppose it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.650 
benefit of this program I suppose it
because<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:21.940> does<00:04:22.120> go<00:04:22.300> over<00:04:22.450> an<00:04:22.570> extended

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
because it does go over an extended

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.430 
because it does go over an extended
period<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.290> time<00:04:24.660> relationships<00:04:25.660> do<00:04:25.840> for<00:04:26.080> you

the needs of our students as far as the

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.130 
the needs of our students as far as the
student<00:05:08.080> resources<00:05:08.470> are<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:09.210> concern<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.510> the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
student resources are a concern the the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.140 
student resources are a concern the the
dollars<00:05:11.410> are<00:05:11.500> excellent<00:05:11.920> as<00:05:12.010> well<00:05:12.190> we<00:05:13.120> have

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
dollars are excellent as well we have

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.090 
dollars are excellent as well we have
made<00:05:13.480> great<00:05:13.930> use<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.230> those<00:05:14.440> dollars<00:05:14.830> as<00:05:14.950> well

made great use of those dollars as well

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.500 
made great use of those dollars as well
as<00:05:15.190> it's<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.610> good<00:05:15.760> chance<00:05:15.970> for<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.150> students

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
as it's a good chance for the students

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.120 
as it's a good chance for the students
to<00:05:16.540> record<00:05:16.870> some<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.050> their<00:05:17.260> thoughts<00:05:17.530> and

program<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.889> lot<00:06:48.280> more<00:06:48.400> embedded<00:06:48.759> in<00:06:49.330> their

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
program a lot more embedded in their

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.360 
program a lot more embedded in their
minds<00:06:49.870> and<00:06:50.110> what<00:06:50.229> they<00:06:50.319> would<00:06:50.470> have<00:06:50.500> been<00:06:50.740> just

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
minds and what they would have been just

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.100 
minds and what they would have been just
on<00:06:51.819> a<00:06:51.880> one-off<00:06:52.150> session<00:06:52.539> so<00:06:52.690> the<00:06:52.810> uniqueness

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
on a one-off session so the uniqueness

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.499 
on a one-off session so the uniqueness
definitely<00:06:53.650> comes<00:06:53.860> into<00:06:54.099> this<00:06:54.190> idea<00:06:54.400> that<00:06:54.849> it

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
definitely comes into this idea that it

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:57.779 
definitely comes into this idea that it
is<00:06:55.630> run<00:06:55.870> over<00:06:56.650> an<00:06:57.009> eight<00:06:57.130> to<00:06:57.280> 10<00:06:57.430> week<00:06:57.610> period

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
is run over an eight to 10 week period

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.620 
is run over an eight to 10 week period
