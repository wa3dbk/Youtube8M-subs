sets of all time are mostly older sets
and<00:00:18.350> that's<00:00:18.560> because<00:00:18.770> they<00:00:19.190> produce<00:00:19.400> more

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
and that's because they produce more

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.880

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.219

ya ever hear a fiber jar probably one of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.110 
ya ever hear a fiber jar probably one of
the<00:01:03.350> most<00:01:03.499> ridiculous<00:01:04.100> cards<00:01:04.430> ever<00:01:04.640> printed

the most ridiculous cards ever printed

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.480 
the most ridiculous cards ever printed
so<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.810> think<00:01:05.870> that<00:01:06.110> legacy<00:01:06.440> of<00:01:06.650> Darkness<00:01:07.100> was<00:01:07.460> a

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
so I think that legacy of Darkness was a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.090 
so I think that legacy of Darkness was a
very<00:01:07.850> influential<00:01:08.390> set<00:01:08.810> because<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.740> came<00:01:09.920> out

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
very influential set because it came out

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.640 
very influential set because it came out
with<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.310> lot<00:01:10.580> of<00:01:10.730> big<00:01:11.000> monsters<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.960> they<00:01:12.470> also

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
with a lot of big monsters and they also

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.290 
with a lot of big monsters and they also
came<00:01:12.950> out<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.310> staple<00:01:13.760> spell<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.180> trap

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
came out with staple spell and trap

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.150

cards<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.020> still<00:01:15.350> use<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> game

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160

today<00:01:16.340> like<00:01:16.760> creature<00:01:17.030> swap<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:17.750> would

today like creature swap and we would

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.260 
today like creature swap and we would
use<00:01:18.230> royal<00:01:18.470> oppression<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.940> wouldn't<00:01:20.180> be

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
cards that are still competitive today

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.120 
cards that are still competitive today
and<00:01:38.180> they're<00:01:38.930> banned<00:01:39.230> cards<00:01:39.650> were<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.860> little

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
and they're banned cards were a little

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.830 
and they're banned cards were a little
overpowered<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.000> still<00:01:41.270> think<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.570> it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
overpowered but I still think that it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.730 
overpowered but I still think that it's
a<00:01:41.930> great<00:01:42.230> an<00:01:42.560> influential<00:01:43.310> set<00:01:44.440> next<00:01:45.440> we've

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
a great an influential set next we've

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.530 
a great an influential set next we've
got<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.980> newer<00:01:46.310> set<00:01:46.760> and<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
got a newer set and I think it's the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.990 
got a newer set and I think it's the
most<00:01:47.660> influential<00:01:48.260> set<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.880> recent<00:01:49.880> history

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
most influential set in recent history

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.240 
most influential set in recent history

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
duelist revolution produced what I like

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.250 
duelist revolution produced what I like

to call the nasty nine pretty retarded

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.160

soul<00:04:00.640> taker<00:04:00.910> but<00:04:01.450> um<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:03.160> think<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:03.880> by<00:04:04.300> the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
soul taker but um I I think that by the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.420 
soul taker but um I I think that by the
next<00:04:04.810> banned<00:04:05.110> list<00:04:05.320> everyone's<00:04:05.950> gonna<00:04:06.160> move

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
next banned list everyone's gonna move

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.910 
next banned list everyone's gonna move
back<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:07.000> smashing<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.750> don't<00:04:08.320> think<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.620> soul

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
back to smashing I don't think that soul

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.250 
back to smashing I don't think that soul
taker<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.580> stick<00:04:09.910> because<00:04:10.260> giving

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
taker is going to stick because giving

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.470 
taker is going to stick because giving
them<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.500> thousand<00:04:11.950> life<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.610> sack<00:04:12.850> tastic

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
deck is not a big deal but I think that

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.110 
deck is not a big deal but I think that
we<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.830> expect<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.669> next<00:04:18.790> format<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:19.750> slow

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
we can expect the next format to be slow

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.090 
we can expect the next format to be slow
worth<00:04:20.329> in<00:04:20.540> this<00:04:20.690> format<00:04:21.079> because<00:04:21.590> typically

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
worth in this format because typically

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.680 
worth in this format because typically
they<00:04:22.370> go<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:23.090> right<00:04:23.240> we're<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.570> be<00:04:23.660> a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
they go all right we're going to be a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.850 
they go all right we're going to be a
little<00:04:23.870> faster<00:04:24.380> we're<00:04:24.560> going<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.740> get<00:04:24.830> a

little slower more controlled like the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320
