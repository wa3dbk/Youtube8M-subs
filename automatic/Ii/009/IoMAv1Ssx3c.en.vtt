00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.869 
they didn't make a bridge '''l figure
they<00:00:56.670> took<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.899> figure<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.480> this<00:01:00.480> videos<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
they took this figure and this videos in

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.270 
they took this figure and this videos in
natural<00:01:02.879> normal<00:01:03.239> form<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> margin

on margin symbol on his on forehead

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.250 
on margin symbol on his on forehead
which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:09.090> weird<00:01:09.360> cuz<00:01:09.750> Vegeta<00:01:10.110> was

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
which is very weird cuz Vegeta was

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.670 
which is very weird cuz Vegeta was
always<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> Super<00:01:11.070> Saiyan<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
always the Super Saiyan when he was a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
always the Super Saiyan when he was a
Martian<00:01:13.680> form<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.509> either<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:16.170> took<00:01:16.439> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
Martian form and either they took this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
Martian form and either they took this
one<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> made<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.450> took<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
one and made this one or they took this

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
one and made this one or they took this
one<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> made<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.490> original

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
one I made this one so it's not original

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
one I made this one so it's not original
that's<00:01:21.420> why<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.619> we're<00:01:22.740> lazy

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that's why I don't like it we're lazy

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's why I don't like it we're lazy
and<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.189> took<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.720> but<00:01:24.720> instead<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and just took that one but instead of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.539 
and just took that one but instead of
putting<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.590> Super<00:01:25.830> Saiyan<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.340> very

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
putting a Super Saiyan which was very

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.200 
putting a Super Saiyan which was very
odd<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.330> could<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.080> Jax<00:01:29.210> Jax

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
odd you could have put like this Jax Jax

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.130 
odd you could have put like this Jax Jax
