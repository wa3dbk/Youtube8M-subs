00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
give this a socket and I think if I

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.790 
give this a socket and I think if I
rewrote<00:04:51.310> their<00:04:51.490> life<00:04:51.669> percent<00:04:52.090> into<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> socket

rewrote their life percent into a socket

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.090 
rewrote their life percent into a socket
it's<00:04:53.800> better<00:04:54.009> than<00:04:54.160> my<00:04:54.340> home<00:04:55.830> because<00:04:56.830> then<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
it's better than my home because then I

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.320 
it's better than my home because then I
can<00:04:57.250> give<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.490> cooldown<00:04:57.699> reduction<00:04:57.940> as<00:04:58.180> well

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
can give it cooldown reduction as well

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.520 
can give it cooldown reduction as well
should<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.419> rewrote<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.840> life<00:05:01.990> percent<00:05:02.350> in<00:05:02.440> a

socket what do you think because this

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.140 
socket what do you think because this
works<00:05:05.500> also<00:05:05.889> like<00:05:06.039> out<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.520> combat<00:05:06.729> so<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.000> would

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
works also like out of combat so I would

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.230 
works also like out of combat so I would
always<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.539> 80%<00:05:07.870> code<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.470> reduction<00:05:08.889> I

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
always have 80% code and reduction I

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.400 
always have 80% code and reduction I
lose<00:05:10.240> some<00:05:10.389> attack<00:05:10.630> speed<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.020> that's<00:05:11.199> about

lose some attack speed but that's about
