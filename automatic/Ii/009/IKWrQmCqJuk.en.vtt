welcome back I'm Dave and thanks for

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.249 
welcome back I'm Dave and thanks for
your<00:00:02.610> questions<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.270> our<00:00:03.389> last<00:00:03.540> pista<00:00:03.990> video

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
your questions on our last pista video

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.320 
your questions on our last pista video
here<00:00:04.589> are<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> few<00:00:05.069> more<00:00:05.250> piston<00:00:05.700> f8<00:00:06.000> cues<00:00:06.240> that

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
here are a few more piston f8 cues that

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:17.720 
here are a few more piston f8 cues that
you<00:00:06.480> sit<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:15.949> lot<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.160> questions<00:00:17.609> have

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you sit in a lot of your questions have

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210 
you sit in a lot of your questions have
revolved<00:00:18.180> around<00:00:18.300> compression<00:00:19.020> ratio<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
revolved around compression ratio and a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.759 
revolved around compression ratio and a
vistas<00:00:20.580> role<00:00:20.850> within<00:00:21.119> compression<00:00:21.840> ratio<00:00:22.230> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
vistas role within compression ratio so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.050 
vistas role within compression ratio so
first<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> find<00:00:23.820> what

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
first we really need to find what

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
first we really need to find what
compression<00:00:24.570> ratio<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.160> compression<00:00:26.160> ratio

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
compression ratio is compression ratio

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
compression ratio is compression ratio
is<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.849> measurement<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.539> engine<00:00:27.930> cylinder

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
is a measurement of engine cylinder

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.620 
is a measurement of engine cylinder
volume<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.250> basically<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> comparison<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
volume it's basically a comparison of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.060 
volume it's basically a comparison of
the<00:00:30.750> engine<00:00:31.080> cylinders<00:00:31.470> volume<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the engine cylinders volume with the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
the engine cylinders volume with the
piston<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> bottom<00:00:32.880> dead<00:00:33.090> center<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.899> its

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
piston of bottom dead center with its

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.720 
piston of bottom dead center with its
volume<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> piston<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.280> top<00:00:35.520> dead

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
volume with the piston and top dead

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.810 
volume with the piston and top dead
center<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:37.559> engine<00:00:37.920> cylinder<00:00:38.309> had<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
center so if an engine cylinder had a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
center so if an engine cylinder had a
volume<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.570> 100<00:00:39.989> cubic<00:00:40.290> inches<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
volume of 100 cubic inches with the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
volume of 100 cubic inches with the
piston<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.399> bottom<00:00:41.700> dead<00:00:41.879> center<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.050> 10

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
piston at bottom dead center and a 10

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
piston at bottom dead center and a 10
cubic<00:00:43.710> inch<00:00:43.860> volume<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> piston<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.879> top

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
cubic inch volume with the piston at top

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
cubic inch volume with the piston at top
dead<00:00:45.390> center<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> compression<00:00:46.950> ratio<00:00:47.129> would

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
dead center the compression ratio would

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.330 
dead center the compression ratio would
be<00:00:47.489> 10<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> 1<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.350> factors<00:00:49.829> play<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> role

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
be 10 to 1 so what factors play a role

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
be 10 to 1 so what factors play a role
in<00:00:50.700> compression<00:00:51.270> ratio<00:00:51.570> well<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> lot

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
in compression ratio well there's a lot

hear<00:01:35.310> quite<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> piston<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hear quite a lot is what is piston to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
hear quite a lot is what is piston to
valve<00:01:36.990> clearance<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> sounds

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
the piston is at top dead center you
don't<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.780> these<00:01:45.930> two<00:01:46.140> components<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.829> ever
