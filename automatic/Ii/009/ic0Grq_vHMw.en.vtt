notice<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.620> thing<00:01:12.830> had<00:01:13.010> three<00:01:13.280> bars

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
notice that this thing had three bars

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.210 
notice that this thing had three bars
out<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:13.820> five<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:17.140> satellites<00:01:18.140> which<00:01:19.070> I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
out of five for the satellites which I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.350 
out of five for the satellites which I
think<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:19.490> pretty<00:01:19.610> good<00:01:19.820> because<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.210> is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.270 
camera and have to be my laughs and
that's<00:02:54.420> not<00:02:54.570> good<00:02:54.780> when<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.080> driving<00:02:55.320> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that's not good when I'm driving so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.620 
that's not good when I'm driving so
actually<00:02:56.790> I've<00:02:56.850> got<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.120> came<00:02:57.300> around<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
actually I've got to came around a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.310 
actually I've got to came around a
tripod<00:02:58.140> for<00:02:58.410> safety<00:02:59.250> sake

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
tripod for safety sake

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.790 
tripod for safety sake
so<00:03:02.250> hopefully<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.760> won't<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.750> we'll<00:03:04.620> just

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
so hopefully it won't and we'll just

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.140 
so hopefully it won't and we'll just
look<00:03:04.950> at<00:03:05.010> all<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.310> different<00:03:05.700> things<00:03:05.730> while

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
she's doing that I mean it gives us

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.260 
she's doing that I mean it gives us
sunrise<00:03:08.670> sunset<00:03:09.000> elevation<00:03:09.810> time<00:03:10.110> direction

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
sunrise sunset elevation time direction

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.400 
sunrise sunset elevation time direction
next<00:03:12.270> mile<00:03:12.450> marker<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:13.020> some<00:03:13.260> nice

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
next mile marker you know some nice

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.910 
next mile marker you know some nice
information<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.840> then<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.410> zoom

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
information here and then you can zoom

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.260 
information here and then you can zoom
in<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.340> zoom<00:03:17.370> out<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
in and zoom out like that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.640 
in and zoom out like that
in<00:03:22.660> fact<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.500> could<00:03:23.710> probably<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.560> to

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.530 

unless<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.550> have<00:05:52.730> a<00:05:52.760> little<00:05:52.940> bit<00:05:53.120> more<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.480> a

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
unless you have a little bit more of a

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.810 
unless you have a little bit more of a
hard<00:05:53.720> time<00:05:54.340> turn<00:05:55.340> left<00:05:55.670> on<00:05:56.000> West<00:05:56.390> Eggman<00:05:56.870> road

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
hard time turn left on West Eggman road

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.050 
hard time turn left on West Eggman road
unless<00:05:58.820> you<00:05:59.090> have<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> little<00:05:59.960> more<00:06:00.230> part<00:06:00.620> time

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
unless you have a little more part time

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.340 
unless you have a little more part time
looking<00:06:02.060> down<00:06:02.090> or<00:06:02.270> wherever<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:03.020> have<00:06:03.170> the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
looking down or wherever you have the

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.710 
looking down or wherever you have the
GPS<00:06:03.500> add<00:06:03.980> this<00:06:04.190> here<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:05.590> if<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:07.570> suppose<00:06:08.570> if

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
GPS add this here and if I suppose if

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.510 
GPS add this here and if I suppose if
you're<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:09.080> a<00:06:09.320> lot<00:06:09.710> of<00:06:09.740> traffic<00:06:10.220> or<00:06:10.340> you<00:06:10.370> don't

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
you're in a lot of traffic or you don't

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.640 
you're in a lot of traffic or you don't
want<00:06:10.700> to<00:06:10.730> take<00:06:10.880> your<00:06:11.000> eyes<00:06:11.150> off<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.510> road<00:06:11.650> and

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
want to take your eyes off the road and

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.850 
want to take your eyes off the road and
that<00:06:12.680> sort<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.190> thing<00:06:13.430> thing<00:06:13.730> maybe<00:06:14.680> at<00:06:15.680> that

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
that sort of thing thing maybe at that

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.430 
that sort of thing thing maybe at that
point<00:06:16.360> it's<00:06:17.360> worthwhile

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.050 

so<00:06:22.440> now<00:06:22.740> see<00:06:22.980> it<00:06:23.100> shows<00:06:23.280> me<00:06:23.490> I've<00:06:23.640> colored<00:06:23.910> by

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
so now see it shows me I've colored by

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.810 
so now see it shows me I've colored by
the<00:06:24.090> school<00:06:24.450> zone<00:06:24.860> and<00:06:25.860> it<00:06:26.190> actually<00:06:26.670> is

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
the school zone and it actually is

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.240 
the school zone and it actually is
almost<00:06:27.030> too<00:06:27.450> much<00:06:27.480> information<00:06:28.220> that<00:06:29.220> I

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
almost too much information that I

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.620 
almost too much information that I
suppose<00:06:29.760> it<00:06:29.970> could<00:06:30.120> be<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.300> little<00:06:30.480> bit

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
suppose it could be a little bit

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.260 
suppose it could be a little bit
distracting
