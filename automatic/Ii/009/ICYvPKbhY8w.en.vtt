beta<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.640> working<00:01:08.640> prototype

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
beta so it's still a working prototype

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.859 
beta so it's still a working prototype
basically<00:01:09.570> sublime<00:01:10.170> text<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.400> free

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
basically sublime text is not free

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
basically sublime text is not free
however<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> free<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:15.720> what

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
however it is free to use and from what

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.890 
however it is free to use and from what
I<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.080> tell<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.530> far<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
I can tell so far is you can use to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.990 
I can tell so far is you can use to
blind<00:01:19.170> text<00:01:20.689> without<00:01:21.689> paying<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
blind text without paying for it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
blind text without paying for it
indefinitely<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.509> seems<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.979> course

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
indefinitely it seems like but of course

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.289 
indefinitely it seems like but of course
I<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.430> recommend<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> actually

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
I would recommend that you actually

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
I would recommend that you actually
purchase<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
purchase it if you do like it because it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.719 
purchase it if you do like it because it
helps<00:01:29.970> support<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.630> development<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
helps support the development for it but

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
helps support the development for it but
for<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.329> who<00:01:33.540> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> try<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.200> out

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
for those of you who want to try it out

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.600 
for those of you who want to try it out
and<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:34.979> before<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and see what it's like before you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
and see what it's like before you
purchase<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:37.290> whatever<00:01:37.470> price<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.860> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
purchase it for whatever price it is

Python<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:53.040> easier<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> pretty

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
Python a lot easier and it's a pretty

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.149 
Python a lot easier and it's a pretty
sure<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.299> made<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.659> Python<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.110> well<00:01:55.159> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
sure it's made in Python as well the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.959 
sure it's made in Python as well the
next<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.689> py<00:01:58.170> charm<00:01:58.530> py<00:01:59.399> charm<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> an

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
next one is the py charm py charm is an

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.200 
next one is the py charm py charm is an
IDE<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.350> helps<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.740> Django<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
IDE and it helps with Django this is a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
IDE and it helps with Django this is a
little<00:02:03.479> bit<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:03.719> advanced<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.740> believe

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
little bit more advanced and I believe

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
little bit more advanced and I believe
that<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.790> also<00:02:06.180> something<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.930> would

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that it is also something that you would

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.059 
that it is also something that you would
have<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.500> purchase<00:02:08.270> now<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.259> Co<00:02:10.590> code

not really going to go into too much
detail<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.200> these<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.190> kind<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> play

around<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:20.850> them<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.210> you'd<00:02:21.990> like<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.500> just

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
around with them as you'd like I just

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
around with them as you'd like I just
want<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> mention<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.580> basically<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.090> any

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
want to mention that basically for any

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.350 
want to mention that basically for any
project<00:02:25.020> just<00:02:25.350> kind<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.590> pick<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:26.100> text<00:02:27.090> editor

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
project just kind of pick a text editor

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
project just kind of pick a text editor
that<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.260> go<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.740> it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
that you like and just go with it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
that you like and just go with it
because<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.820> nice<00:02:29.940> thing<00:02:30.120> about<00:02:30.150> Python<00:02:30.690> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
because the nice thing about Python and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.540 
because the nice thing about Python and
Django<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.230> they're<00:02:31.350> open<00:02:31.650> source<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.370> it's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
Django is they're open source so it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.910 
Django is they're open source so it's
not<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.940> working<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.480> Word<00:02:33.810> or<00:02:34.170> Apple's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
not like working in Word or Apple's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.810 
not like working in Word or Apple's
pages<00:02:35.490> where<00:02:36.120> they're<00:02:36.270> kind<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.570> proprietary

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
pages where they're kind of proprietary

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.850 
pages where they're kind of proprietary
you<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:39.030> work<00:02:39.540> with<00:02:39.750> Python<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> Python<00:02:40.650> file

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you can work with Python a Python file

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.140 
you can work with Python a Python file
in<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.850> whole<00:02:42.150> variety<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:43.280> programs<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:45.090> can

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
in a whole variety of programs that can

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.970 
in a whole variety of programs that can
read<00:02:45.480> Python<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.170> they<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.410> read<00:02:46.590> Python

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
read Python so if they can read Python

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010 
read Python so if they can read Python
they<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.280> work<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.700> Python<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.840> means

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
they can work in Python and that means

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.800 
they can work in Python and that means
that<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.380> type<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.280> so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that you can type in and all that so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.230 
that you can type in and all that so
what<00:02:51.810> sublime<00:02:52.410> text<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.950> also<00:02:53.520> Komodo<00:02:54.180> edit

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
what sublime text and also Komodo edit

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.810 
what sublime text and also Komodo edit
do<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.930> they<00:02:55.410> help<00:02:55.590> actually<00:02:56.280> code<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> little

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
do is they help actually code a little

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.960 
do is they help actually code a little
bit<00:02:56.970> easier<00:02:57.270> with<00:02:57.480> Auto<00:02:57.810> completion<00:02:58.260> syntax

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
bit easier with Auto completion syntax

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.180 
bit easier with Auto completion syntax
checking<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.600> stuff<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.040> I'm<00:03:02.040> going

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
checking and all that stuff so I'm going

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.590 
checking and all that stuff so I'm going
to<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.340> ahead<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.640> let<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.850> download<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.300> from

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
to go ahead and let you download it from

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.070 
to go ahead and let you download it from
here

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
here

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.170 
here
and<00:03:04.280> I'm<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.490> minimize<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.000> I'm

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and I'm going to minimize it so I'm

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.100 
and I'm going to minimize it so I'm
going<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.360> assume<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.020> it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
going to assume that you have it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.990 
going to assume that you have it
installed<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.130> point<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.850> don't

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
installed at this point so if you don't

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.490 
installed at this point so if you don't
have<00:03:09.120> installed<00:03:09.420> go<00:03:09.630> ahead<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.870> pause<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
have installed go ahead and pause it and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.660 
have installed go ahead and pause it and
then<00:03:10.560> come<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.300> project<00:03:12.890> or<00:03:13.890> actually

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
then come to the project or actually

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.550 
then come to the project or actually
open<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.030> Komodo<00:03:15.330> edit<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:16.320> what<00:03:16.470> we

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
open up Komodo edit so that's what we

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.970 
open up Komodo edit so that's what we
have<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.710> this<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.280> Komodo<00:03:17.610> edit<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.980> what

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
have here this is Komodo edit and what

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.040 
have here this is Komodo edit and what
you'll<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:21.090> I'm<00:03:21.300> on<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.630> desktop

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
you'll see is if like I'm on the desktop

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.260 
you'll see is if like I'm on the desktop
if<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.290> open<00:03:22.530> up<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.740> desktop<00:03:23.040> I'll<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.820> test

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
if I open up the desktop I'll see a test

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.240 
if I open up the desktop I'll see a test
project<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> made<00:03:25.080> already<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.100> can

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
project that I made already and I can

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
project that I made already and I can
click<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.640> setting<00:03:27.120> stop<00:03:27.330> py<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:28.050> open<00:03:28.380> that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
click on setting stop py just open that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.800 
click on setting stop py just open that
up<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:28.920> already<00:03:29.730> you'll<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.240> like<00:03:30.630> different

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
up and already you'll see like different

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.770 
up and already you'll see like different
colors<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.860> brackets<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.820> all<00:03:33.030> types<00:03:33.630> of

colors and brackets and all types of
things<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.080> are<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.320> checking<00:03:35.010> our<00:03:35.160> syntax

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
things that are just checking our syntax

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.780 
things that are just checking our syntax
so<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.210> type<00:03:36.390> something<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:38.520> might

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
so if I just type something and it might

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.150 
so if I just type something and it might
not<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.030> work<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:40.020> my<00:03:40.380> will<00:03:40.620> they<00:03:40.920> might

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
not actually work or my will they might

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.300 
not actually work or my will they might
actually<00:03:41.550> work<00:03:42.150> too<00:03:42.830> it's<00:03:43.830> not<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
actually work too it's not going to be a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.680 
actually work too it's not going to be a
perfect<00:03:44.670> thing<00:03:44.850> where<00:03:45.210> it's<00:03:45.330> constantly

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
perfect thing where it's constantly

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.990 
perfect thing where it's constantly
checking<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.650> there's<00:03:46.950> errors<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.610> mean

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
checking if if there's errors I mean

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.310 
checking if if there's errors I mean
we'll<00:03:48.210> check<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.570> there's<00:03:48.750> errors<00:03:49.020> but<00:03:49.170> it's

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
we'll check if there's errors but it's

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.930 
we'll check if there's errors but it's
not<00:03:49.440> always<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.010> perfect<00:03:50.280> or<00:03:50.670> right

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
not always going to be perfect or right

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.720 
not always going to be perfect or right
or<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.960> also<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:52.350> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.730> exactly

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
or it's also not going to know exactly

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.370 
or it's also not going to know exactly
what<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.060> error<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.420> lot<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.020> times<00:03:55.170> when

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
what the error is a lot of times when

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.660 
what the error is a lot of times when
you<00:03:55.470> run<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.800> code<00:03:55.980> it'll<00:03:56.190> say<00:03:56.370> there's<00:03:56.580> an

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
you run the code it'll say there's an

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.910 
you run the code it'll say there's an
error<00:03:56.850> with<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> code<00:03:57.390> but<00:03:57.920> nevertheless

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
error with the code but nevertheless

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.860 
error with the code but nevertheless
Komodo<00:03:59.580> edit<00:03:59.700> makes<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.240> lot<00:04:00.390> easier<00:04:00.840> to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
Komodo edit makes it a lot easier to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.500 
Komodo edit makes it a lot easier to
work<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.410> things<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.070> imports<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.390> all

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.350 
errors but if you do from Jango dot I
mean<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.680> lot<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:22.950> times<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> might<00:04:23.520> do<00:04:23.760> code

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.880 
mean a lot of times it might do code
completion<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.169> not<00:04:25.410> necessarily

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
completion but it's not necessarily

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.540 
completion but it's not necessarily
going<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.340> that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
going to do that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
going to do that
meaning<00:04:26.849> it's<00:04:27.479> not<00:04:27.659> always<00:04:27.900> going<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.229> tell

you like use dot Kampf it's not always

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.879 
you like use dot Kampf it's not always
going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.610> check<00:04:32.879> that<00:04:33.199> specifically<00:04:34.199> if<00:04:34.800> you

you don't wanna pay for something this
is<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.470> great<00:04:49.770> great<00:04:50.220> version<00:04:50.909> of<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.389> I'm

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
is a great great version of it so I'm

is a great great version of it so I'm
going<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.810> exit<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:52.289> out<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:54.110> now<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.139> have

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
going to exit that out and now I have

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.520 
going to exit that out and now I have

similar but it doesn't open up with a
way<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.259> browse<00:05:01.830> all<00:05:02.219> the<00:05:02.280> files<00:05:02.819> so<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> can

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
way to browse all the files so you can

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.409 
way to browse all the files so you can
just<00:05:03.479> go<00:05:03.599> to<00:05:03.629> file<00:05:03.960> open<00:05:04.289> file<00:05:04.860> or<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.300> go

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
just go to file open file or you can go

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.559 
just go to file open file or you can go

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
what's going on and this code completion

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.269 
what's going on and this code completion
I<00:05:29.610> believe<00:05:29.940> is<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.599> little<00:05:31.469> bit<00:05:31.590> more<00:05:31.740> solid

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
I believe is a little bit more solid

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.180 
I believe is a little bit more solid
