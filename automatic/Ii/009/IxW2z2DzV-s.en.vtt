00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.270
 little video to take a look at all 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.589
 the effects in creative effects on the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 bed of a compact so the routing 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.240
 normal hop we can adjust everything 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.340
 is brightness and contrast is happening 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 like that hue saturation 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.619
 here you can manage the different 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.359
 hues and a slight delay if I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.669
 do not cheat yeah I see nothing that changes 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.730
 good you can do it 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.450
 it's a duplicate mode you see this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.160
 kind of stuff 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.960
 I'm also going in this mode for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 give the impression that you are at 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.660
 waterfront a dance mode is a movie 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.059
 in addition that anime is nice enough with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.449
 different modes so that's the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.449
 first 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.640
 this is the second is the last one 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 everything flows motion effects so that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.130
 it's a bit anything but 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.010
 why are not there little stars 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.900
 there bubbles and I believe that the last 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:25.619
 cd hockey note a mosaic effect if 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.560
 you want to film some things in 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.869
 all intimacy 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.840
 now short this is a bit strange 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.180
 also hanging around moving or wes to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.540
 hockey could handle that as you 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.540
 want it's a bit nostalgic sheaf 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 with the management here of the brightness these 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.759
 voice if that's it it's the exhibition you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.439
 can adjust a little as you want 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 you can of course take pictures 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.770
 at the same time we have a tilt shift mode 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.330
 it's not bad it can stretch or change 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.680
 the blur area 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 so there for example it gives 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.620
 the impression that hatred is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.880
 completely in miniature no but it's 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.090
 better to do it with buildings this 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.080
 kind of things bursting with 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.110
 really competent colors so that's it 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.400
 simply allows saturation 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:28.020
 shade sepia or black and white 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:34.440
 must adjust his fisheye mode without 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.600
 possible adjustments super drawing in 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.200
 colors 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:44.360
 good why not the saints in pencil 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 same kind but in pencil you see here 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:55.550
 cartoon wahou be colors 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.800
 Partial tap on an area to colorize 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.170
 who is the age and colorized the grass I 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.310
 colorise ah yes the sky and white during 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.010
 there the leaves on the left I can 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.320
 colorized the tarpaulin 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.550
 it works well it's good it's a whole 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.370
 little jerky but it works when 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.200
 even well shutter harris and it's this 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.600
 famous effect les toussaint not so be 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.209
 just to the movement be constantly 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.489
 like that but accentuated anyway with 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.720
 movement 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.450
 kaleidoscope I think that's the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.930
 last or there use your fingers for 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.930
 change the image displayed here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.080
 yeah bah listen if you like doing 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.819
 things a bit creative and that's it 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.890
 so we still have a good gaggle 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.459
 dfs rather nice I pass them in 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.709
 normal mode 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.970
 Well, well, that was just for you 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.970
 give a little overview
