00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.139 
thought it was okay I don't want to bash
it<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.369> I've<00:01:26.490> heard<00:01:26.700> such<00:01:26.880> great<00:01:27.060> things

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
it because I've heard such great things

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.600

about<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.170> saw<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.740> people<00:01:29.460> were

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
about it and I saw that people were

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
about it and I saw that people were
getting<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.479> results<00:01:30.899> from<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.140> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
getting really good results from it so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.889
