way for your for your for your audio

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.220 
way for your for your for your audio
output<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.910> change<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.600> variable

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
output you can change it from variable

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.330 
output you can change it from variable
to<00:02:34.530> fixed<00:02:34.820> fixed<00:02:35.820> basically<00:02:36.620> basically<00:02:37.620> gives

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
to fixed fixed basically basically gives

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340 
to fixed fixed basically basically gives
it<00:02:38.520> its<00:02:38.700> own<00:02:38.940> control<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.750> you're<00:02:40.200> basically

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it its own control so you're basically

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410 
it its own control so you're basically
controlling<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.160> video<00:02:41.400> output<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.150> mute
