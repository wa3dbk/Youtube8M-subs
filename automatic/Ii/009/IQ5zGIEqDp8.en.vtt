 it 's not good it 's not good until you do not 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 loses saying that it's not good, it's not 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 good it is not good it is logical that it is not 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
 Good, the kid, the globe, all the time saying 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 this same litany see that he even 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 turned blue again is good test 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 said that it was not what is not 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 good this time wolf because I'm in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 ball on a thing drawn soon you 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 know how to carry a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 drawing inside the pc basta 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.920
 hanging on the wall and photographing it with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.680
 your simple cell phone so just do it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 that's a good son here we have our 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 drawing that was photographed and we'll see 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.309
 he is in rgp mode 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.309
 what is the drawing is in rgb mode for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.969
 explain this I'm going to do four 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.340
 I'll paint them and paint them. 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.000
 first red frame 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:11.960
 I'll paint the second square and yellow 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 and I'm going to paint the third square of blue 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.680
 and the fourth square I'll paint from 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 green then rgb is an image that is in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.259
 four color is a certain color image 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.240
 I just want to get this image to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.869
 black and white will do that I will 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.549
 up here in pictures and puts it in the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.799
 shades of gray 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.750
 when the image is grayscale 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 the image is black and white only that the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.460
 picture is too dark and too gray and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.500
 I want to highlight the trait of the drawing 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 so I come here in brightness settings 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.259
 contrast and then this pallet had 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.100
 so we click on using the legacy and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.759
 Let's check how the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.640
 contrast 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.829
 so if you move this pointer here 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.920
 to the left or to the right to 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.619
 image will look more or less 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.319
 contrasted and here in the moving brightness 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.590
 The picture may look more 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.980
 clear or darker purpose here is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 highlight the stroke of the drawing 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.430
 then we change the contrast in the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.780
 brightness so that the trace is 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.280
 Spotlight 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.940
 the gray and it diminishes and becomes white to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 people can manipulate this image 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.780
 When do you think it's cool, you? 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430
 click ok but the image is still 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.090
 science then let's get the wand 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.459
 magic click on the white area click on 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.739
 left mouse button and we will click 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.650
 in similar 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.720
 doing this he will select everything that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 is white after the left button on the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.349
 mouse again let's select reverse 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.829
 and now we've selected the entire route 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.709
 now we go in layers here 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.620
 Let's close the little eye of the background. 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.420
 and now you can see that the trace is 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.440
 highlighted and now let's select these 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.200
 gray squares back up here 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.319
 to layer and let's change the name of this 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.930
 layer for a template and now let's 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.519
 left-click on the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.750
 brush 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:31.130
 we select the black color and we give alt 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.630
 to paint the trace of black ash 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:41.790
 ready being good we come in here 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.609
 palette layers and click them and let's 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.910
 here in the drawing window of the globe and 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.299
 Let's get this layer and let's drag 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.200
 into the drawing window of the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.069
 block 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.870
 okay now what we do click 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.200
 in efe 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.310
 to enter full screen mode 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.230
 click view to move the picture that 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.459
 we give against ot 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.370
 Here we take the vertex of the image and 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.180
 place here in the center of the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.239
 lines and let's adjust the dash 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.170
 so that it is well centered with 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:29.150
 the block design 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:32.810
 Okay, well done, we'll get the 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.260
 latium tool and we will take these 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.950
 eyes and that mouth that were different 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.220
 drawing of the original block 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.640
 selecting everything press delete and ok 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.640
 done 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.160
 It's not good, it 's good, it's good. 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.160
 that it is not a good creature, it is not 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.500
 a drawing is a rabbi close to being me 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.500
 I find a way in this scribble, bye, I went. 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:22.189
