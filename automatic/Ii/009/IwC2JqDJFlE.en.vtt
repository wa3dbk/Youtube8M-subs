just<00:00:47.890> as<00:00:48.340> you<00:00:48.640> two<00:00:48.790> guys<00:00:48.940> were<00:00:49.180> in<00:00:49.540> 2012<00:00:50.070> 100%<00:00:51.070> I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
just as you two guys were in 2012 100% I

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
think every team needs to go in with a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.880 
think every team needs to go in with a
contingency<00:00:54.070> plan<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.140> was<00:00:56.350> last<00:00:56.590> year<00:00:56.739> at

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.170 
has a bad day in the mountains that
could<00:03:44.260> be<00:03:44.470> potentially<00:03:45.340> minutes<00:03:45.670> lost<00:03:45.910> there

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
could be potentially minutes lost there

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.640 
could be potentially minutes lost there
so<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:50.019> me<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.260> looks<00:03:50.470> like<00:03:50.530> the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
so I think the to me it looks like the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.050 
so I think the to me it looks like the
races<00:03:51.040> can<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.250> won<00:03:51.549> or<00:03:51.579> lost<00:03:51.700> in<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
races can be won or lost in the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.440 
races can be won or lost in the
mountains<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.720> year's<00:03:52.930> Tour<00:03:53.110> de<00:03:53.230> France

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
little negative stories that say

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.750 
little negative stories that say
compassionately<00:04:00.140> what's<00:04:01.040> your<00:04:01.160> thoughts<00:04:01.640> on

the whole thing it's it's disappointing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.080 
the whole thing it's it's disappointing
it<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:06.560> shocking<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.580> came<00:04:08.210> as<00:04:09.100> no<00:04:10.100> surprise

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
it it's shocking it came as no surprise

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.360 
it it's shocking it came as no surprise
to<00:04:11.600> me<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.870> think<00:04:12.050> everyone<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.800> cycling

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
to me I think everyone in the cycling

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.190 
to me I think everyone in the cycling
world<00:04:13.600> knew<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.810> was<00:04:14.930> gonna<00:04:15.080> come<00:04:15.170> out<00:04:15.500> but<00:04:17.200> to

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
world knew it was gonna come out but to

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.380 
world knew it was gonna come out but to
actually<00:04:18.380> hear<00:04:18.800> and<00:04:19.010> say<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> words<00:04:19.580> that<00:04:20.060> he

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
actually hear and say the words that he

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.060 
actually hear and say the words that he
doped<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:21.760> he<00:04:22.760> towed<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:24.470> such<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> scale

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
doped and he towed so to such a scale

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.050 
doped and he towed so to such a scale
that's<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.480> shocking<00:04:26.800> but<00:04:27.800> it's<00:04:28.160> it's

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
that's it is shocking but it's it's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.240 
that's it is shocking but it's it's
something<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:29.630> hope<00:04:29.870> will<00:04:30.650> help<00:04:31.040> the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250

last year's Tour de France was was a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.860 
last year's Tour de France was was a
clear<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:06.950> clear<00:05:07.340> statement<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:07.940> say<00:05:08.120> yes<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
clear a clear statement to say yes the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.870 
clear a clear statement to say yes the
sport<00:05:09.140> has<00:05:09.290> changed<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:10.070> know<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.670> would<00:05:10.850> have

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
sport has changed I know I would have

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.690 
sport has changed I know I would have
never<00:05:10.970> been<00:05:11.360> able<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.630> do<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.990> if<00:05:12.260> if<00:05:13.160> doping

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
never been able to do that if if doping

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.270 
never been able to do that if if doping
still<00:05:13.910> was<00:05:14.090> prevalent<00:05:14.540> in<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.750> sport<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.290> see

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
still was prevalent in the sport you see

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.450 
still was prevalent in the sport you see
so<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:16.640> really<00:05:16.820> optimistic<00:05:17.420> fans<00:05:17.960> can<00:05:18.140> be

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
so it's really optimistic fans can be

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.580 
so it's really optimistic fans can be
confident<00:05:19.460> about<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:20.510> riders<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.320> sport

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
confident about the riders and the sport

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.960 
confident about the riders and the sport
going<00:05:21.740> forward<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.190> think<00:05:22.220> makes<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.610> closer<00:05:22.850> to

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
going forward I think makes it closer to

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.270 
going forward I think makes it closer to
under<00:05:23.210> person<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.750> think<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.920> presents

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
under person I think it presents

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.430 
under person I think it presents
presents<00:05:26.060> us<00:05:26.450> with<00:05:26.570> an<00:05:26.750> opportunity<00:05:27.290> at<00:05:27.380> the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
presents us with an opportunity at the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.070 
presents us with an opportunity at the
moment<00:05:27.830> it's<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:30.640> sport<00:05:31.640> needs<00:05:31.850> new<00:05:32.360> new

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
moment it's a sport needs new new

moment it's a sport needs new new
figures<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.650> look<00:05:33.770> up<00:05:33.920> to<00:05:34.100> clean<00:05:34.940> winners<00:05:35.330> who

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
figures to look up to clean winners who

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.910 
figures to look up to clean winners who
aren't<00:05:35.690> going<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.960> get<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.230> title<00:05:36.440> stripped

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
aren't going to get the title stripped
