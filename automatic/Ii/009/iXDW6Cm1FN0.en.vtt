00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello and welcome to this crowd 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:10.950
 is the recipe of the day is the mascarpone 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.950
 ice cream and we need 250 g of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 mascarpone 150 g walnuts 50 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 g of sugar 3 e 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 rum and a teaspoon of extract of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 liquid vanilla first step we get there 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.990
 by the whites of the egg yolks not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.990
 that I was going to bring down 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.679
 we do not do like a pure a big 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 salad bowl for the game you day drill 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:48.059
 one 40 g of sugar and now 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.799
 I will bleach together wow the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.309
 bleached mixture I'm going now 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:57.500
 add the mascarpone 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.500
 we just have vanilla and Roma 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.100
 we will now rest and 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.920
 during that time we will take care of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 far we will heat a skillet and 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.510
 we're going to put the nuts we're going to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.740
 crushing them roughly we put them to 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.610
 heat for lightly roasted 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.440
 so in fact we stop when she 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 starts to be very slightly golden 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.530
 it's already very good and we will add the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.450
 remaining sugar to caramelize 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.150
 and that's it without a caramel dress 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.930
 it feels like the time we shall 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.270
 cloakroom told me what to aim for 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.740
 to stop cooking when leftovers 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.869
 caramel in the bottom of the pan 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.010
 of water in the sense of tapol the most 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.440
 simple is to put some water 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.270
 in and put back on this lot in 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.250
 heating ball will melt the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.650
 caramel and caramel tones he'll tell himself 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.060
 or just in the water is the ol 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 takes a caramel color 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.560
 it means that the caramel has 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.030
 dissolves in bye bye caramel on 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.650
 let cool points are there we go 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.600
 to turn the egg whites into snow yesterday 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.250
 Thursday 27th salt in the whites and very 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.510
 psychological but I can not climb 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.400
 whites in snow to put a 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.899
 pinch of salt from in my mother do it 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.090
 my grandmothers the bottom I think that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.920
 my ancestors did it to me if I put 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.420
 no scene a white game it's not going 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.040
 finally did you also say 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.400
 just like that so you can not go 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.620
 in the kitchen 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.260
 if that's the case tell me in the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.800
 comments it will interest me that plays 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.120
 already some of the whites incorporate them 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.150
 really delicately the idea is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.099
 really from air master to a bettor 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.099
 jealous all the rest at once 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.500
 caramelized walnut kernels are 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 cooled down we're going to detach them 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.140
 each other 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.459
 we mix again gently 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.770
 remains more than pouring into a mold 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.750
 so a plastic mold or a mold 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.580
 silicone or even a tray 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.959
 aluminum all it takes 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.709
 a mold that they can move to 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.180
 freezer 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.890
 especially it is not necessary that it goes up until 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.000
 at the top of the mold because it's actually 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.380
 takes volume 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.810
 it only remains to put in 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.500
 freezer for 10 hours 10 hours 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 it's been a long time, but in fact you'll have 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.930
 the time to look at all 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.780
 tremendous colette revenue programs 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.810
 they're right there you'll go from 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.330
 good time and that's where we mascarpone 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.569
 ice cream and mussels is a delight to his 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 keep as is or with a small 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.290
 Red fruit coulis 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.020
 give it a little festive side 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.750
 adding a few small stars and 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.130
 I have an interest in hurrying to serve 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.330
 is that this article I give you 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.830

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.800
 new recipe and if you do not want to 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.120
 lose a crumb a tip to bonoua the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.860
 chain cook is a little all 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.840
 time the same thing in me I work 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.710
 and you look at me could help me 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.940
 it would be really nice 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.940
 baal and pose his camera and help me 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.920
 it's still more fun to do that 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.920
 at 2 1 but cooking is sharing
