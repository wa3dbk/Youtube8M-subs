the Flex 3401 uses gear drives with an

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.470 
the Flex 3401 uses gear drives with an
offset<00:01:55.080> eccentric<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.490> uses<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> gears<00:01:57.210> on

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
offset eccentric so it uses the gears on

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.260 
offset eccentric so it uses the gears on
the<00:01:57.750> pad<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.830> gears<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.610> machine

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the pad and the gears on the machine

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.170 
the pad and the gears on the machine
combined<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.140> eccentric<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.430> actually

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
combined with the eccentric to actually

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.320 
combined with the eccentric to actually
give<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.930> dual<00:02:04.650> action<00:02:04.980> that's<00:02:05.640> forced<00:02:06.120> so<00:02:06.270> I'm

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
give a dual action that's forced so I'm

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.910 
give a dual action that's forced so I'm
going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.510> put<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:06.750> back<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.770> show

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
going to put this back on here to show

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080 
going to put this back on here to show
you<00:02:07.980> guys<00:02:08.069> what<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> mean<00:02:08.489> by<00:02:08.580> forced<00:02:08.940> dual

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you guys what I mean by forced dual

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
you guys what I mean by forced dual
action<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:10.410> where<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.220> turn<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
action and that's where as I turn the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.420 
action and that's where as I turn the
head

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
head

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.759

the head of the vacuum plate the machine

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.280 
the head of the vacuum plate the machine
is<00:02:14.950> forced<00:02:15.400> into<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.939> dual<00:02:16.120> action<00:02:16.299> that's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
is forced into the dual action that's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.170 
is forced into the dual action that's
because<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.799> gears<00:02:18.220> inside<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.849> machine

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
because the gears inside the machine

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
because the gears inside the machine
force<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:20.079> dual<00:02:20.290> action<00:02:20.500> every<00:02:21.010> time<00:02:21.189> a

force that dual action every time a
rotation<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.879> made<00:02:22.090> let's<00:02:23.019> pull<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.349> off<00:02:23.439> to

the two side-by-side you will notice

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.050 
the two side-by-side you will notice
that<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.200> Flex<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.340> Porter<00:02:57.609> Cable<00:02:57.760> look

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
that the Flex and the Porter Cable look

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.910 
that the Flex and the Porter Cable look
very<00:02:58.269> different<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:58.840> they<00:02:59.230> function<00:02:59.560> very

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
very different but they function very

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.849 
very different but they function very
similarly<00:03:00.159> as<00:03:00.849> well<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.019> an<00:03:02.290> eccentric

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
similarly as well we have an eccentric

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.759 
similarly as well we have an eccentric
off<00:03:03.040> offset<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.150> side<00:03:04.389> we<00:03:05.319> also<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.709> an

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
off offset on this side we also have an

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.679 
off offset on this side we also have an
eccentric<00:03:06.129> offset<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.639> this<00:03:06.819> side<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.629> the

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
eccentric offset on this side but the

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.559 
eccentric offset on this side but the
added<00:03:08.379> gear<00:03:09.129> tooth<00:03:09.489> pattern<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.359> gear

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
added gear tooth pattern now the gear

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.559 
added gear tooth pattern now the gear
tooth<00:03:10.780> pattern<00:03:11.019> helps<00:03:11.650> give<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.829> more<00:03:12.189> powerful

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
tooth pattern helps give a more powerful

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.199 
tooth pattern helps give a more powerful
bite<00:03:13.569> with<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.980> flexible<00:03:15.489> action<00:03:15.819> polisher

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
bite with the flexible action polisher

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.750 
bite with the flexible action polisher
this<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> powerful<00:03:17.260> 800<00:03:17.889> watt<00:03:18.129> motor<00:03:18.400> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
this is a powerful 800 watt motor and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.849 
this is a powerful 800 watt motor and
that<00:03:18.790> helps<00:03:19.629> remove<00:03:19.840> swirls<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.319> scratches<00:03:20.440> a

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
that helps remove swirls and scratches a

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.439 
that helps remove swirls and scratches a
little<00:03:21.069> bit<00:03:21.190> faster<00:03:21.579> than<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:21.760> porter<00:03:22.060> cable

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
little bit faster than the porter cable

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.740 
little bit faster than the porter cable
it<00:03:23.410> has<00:03:23.470> more<00:03:23.980> bite<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.730> paint<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.120> well<00:03:25.180> as

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
it has more bite to the paint as well as

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.210 
it has more bite to the paint as well as
having<00:03:25.900> more<00:03:26.169> finishing<00:03:26.500> capabilities

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
having more finishing capabilities

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.069 
having more finishing capabilities
because<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.699> gear<00:03:27.909> drive<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.810> porter

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
because of the gear drive the porter

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.170 
because of the gear drive the porter
cable<00:03:29.230> has<00:03:29.560> its<00:03:29.739> advantages<00:03:30.250> as<00:03:30.430> well<00:03:30.639> because

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
cable has its advantages as well because

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.390 
cable has its advantages as well because
it<00:03:31.299> can<00:03:31.419> run<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.569> smaller<00:03:31.959> backing<00:03:32.470> plate<00:03:32.709> both

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
it can run a smaller backing plate both

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.979 
it can run a smaller backing plate both
of<00:03:33.549> these<00:03:33.609> machines<00:03:33.819> can<00:03:34.180> run<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.359> five<00:03:34.629> or<00:03:34.959> a
