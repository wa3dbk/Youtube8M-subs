00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
water in that tank you can have water in

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.860 
water in that tank you can have water in
the<00:02:04.400> whole<00:02:04.520> trial<00:02:04.880> could<00:02:05.180> be<00:02:05.450> one<00:02:05.630> along<00:02:05.840> with

the whole trial could be one along with

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.290 
the whole trial could be one along with
having<00:02:06.410> water<00:02:06.619> heater<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.100> gas<00:02:07.340> right<00:02:08.090> you

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
having water heater on gas right you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.699 
having water heater on gas right you
could<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.600> your<00:02:08.750> refrigerator<00:02:09.289> running<00:02:09.380> on

could have your refrigerator running on

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.040 
could have your refrigerator running on
gays<00:02:09.979> right<00:02:10.399> as<00:02:10.789> long<00:02:10.910> as<00:02:11.180> your<00:02:11.420> batteries<00:02:11.870> up

need it to burn how long do you think a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.199 
need it to burn how long do you think a
battery<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> don't<00:02:16.940> know

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
battery would that if you don't know

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
need to know how many amps something

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.740 
need to know how many amps something
pulls<00:03:09.640> it'll<00:03:10.640> tell<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:10.880> how<00:03:10.940> many<00:03:11.180> watts<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
pulls it'll tell you how many watts of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.949 
pulls it'll tell you how many watts of
the<00:03:11.870> yeah<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.769> convert<00:03:12.980> Watson<00:03:13.549> up<00:03:13.959> 120

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the yeah you can convert Watson up 120

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.260 
the yeah you can convert Watson up 120
about<00:03:15.230> 120

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
about 120

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.180 
about 120
how<00:03:16.480> many<00:03:16.810> 120<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.470> come<00:03:17.620> into<00:03:17.770> it<00:03:17.950> that's<00:03:18.100> how

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
how many 120 I come into it that's how

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.580 
how many 120 I come into it that's how
