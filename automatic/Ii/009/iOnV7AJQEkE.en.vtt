00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
a lot easier if we look at the edge of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349 
a lot easier if we look at the edge of
your<00:00:27.960> knife<00:00:28.050> microscopically<00:00:29.000> it<00:00:30.000> might<00:00:30.210> look

your knife microscopically it might look

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
your knife microscopically it might look
something<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> comes<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
something like this see how it comes to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
something like this see how it comes to
a<00:00:32.369> point<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> bottom<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
a point there down at the bottom it's a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.010 
a point there down at the bottom it's a
very<00:00:34.079> good<00:00:34.350> thing<00:00:35.390> through<00:00:36.390> normal<00:00:36.750> everyday

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
very good thing through normal everyday

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.830 
very good thing through normal everyday
use<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:38.190> edge<00:00:38.550> although<00:00:39.120> still<00:00:39.360> pointed

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
use that edge although still pointed

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.190 
use that edge although still pointed
gets<00:00:40.079> curled<00:00:40.440> under<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.070> knife<00:00:41.540> hmm<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:43.020> not

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
gets curled under the knife hmm it's not

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
gets curled under the knife hmm it's not
the<00:00:43.379> best<00:00:43.559> thing<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> world<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:45.020> it's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the best thing in the world but it's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.330 
the best thing in the world but it's
much<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.440> than<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.039> knife<00:00:47.190> was

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
much different than if your knife was

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
much different than if your knife was
blunted<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> bottom<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.590> look

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
blunted on the bottom that would look

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.930 
blunted on the bottom that would look
something<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.820> would

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
something like this and that would

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
something like this and that would
require<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.300> stone<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.410> couple<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> hours

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
require a stone and a couple of hours

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.209 
require a stone and a couple of hours
worth<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> work<00:00:53.539> not<00:00:54.539> good<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.100> keep

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
worth of work not good so how do we keep

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
worth of work not good so how do we keep
it<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:56.460> getting<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.850> point<00:00:57.120> well<00:00:57.750> we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it from getting to that point well we

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
it from getting to that point well we
hone<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> knife<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> hone<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> often<00:00:59.609> in

hone the knife and we hone it often in

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
hone the knife and we hone it often in
order<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> hone<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> knife<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.770> we

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
order to hone the knife we use what we

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.390 
order to hone the knife we use what we
call<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> steel<00:01:03.860> now<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> pretty

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
but i prefer the 45-degree angle because

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.650 
but i prefer the 45-degree angle because
simply<00:02:31.590> that's<00:02:31.770> how<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.190> taught<00:02:32.420> we<00:02:33.420> grasp

at<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.680> point<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.310> knife<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.700> honed<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.270> it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
at this point the knife is honed and it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.060 
at this point the knife is honed and it
should<00:03:09.570> be<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.960> sharp<00:03:10.260> as<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.710> was<00:03:10.800> pretty

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
should be as sharp as if it was pretty
