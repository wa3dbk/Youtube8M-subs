00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
but that is it I think that's a

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.689 
but that is it I think that's a
psychological<00:04:16.229> thing<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.979> age<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.459> think

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
psychological thing at that age I think

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.009 
psychological thing at that age I think
that<00:04:17.849> this<00:04:17.970> kid<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.479> know<00:04:18.599> for<00:04:18.840> whatever

stuff<00:04:20.849> and<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.660> you're<00:04:21.780> right<00:04:21.959> it's

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
stuff and and I think you're right it's

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.959
