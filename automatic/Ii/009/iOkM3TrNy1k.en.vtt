doing<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.210> been<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.629> asshat<00:00:48.960> at

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
doing it's been a bit of an asshat at

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.009 
doing it's been a bit of an asshat at
the<00:00:49.769> moment<00:00:49.949> trying<00:00:50.429> to<00:00:50.550> block<00:00:50.820> off<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.359> is-6

for some reason the is-6 has a better

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.239 
for some reason the is-6 has a better
speed<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> tiger<00:00:56.789> should<00:00:57.089> be

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249
