00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
connected to the card it would disable

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
connected to the card it would disable
your<00:00:57.180> internet<00:00:57.629> connection<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.859> has

a picture of the card here flash in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
a picture of the card here flash in
obviously<00:01:51.060> worse<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.540> standard<00:01:52.079> B<00:01:52.229> G<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
obviously worse on the standard B G and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
obviously worse on the standard B G and
N<00:01:52.770> wireless<00:01:52.799> networks<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.200> see

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
N wireless networks this as you can see

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
N wireless networks this as you can see
on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> side<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> wo3<00:01:56.820> flash<00:01:57.509> err<00:01:57.719> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
on the side is the wo3 flash err so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.810 
on the side is the wo3 flash err so
basically<00:01:58.170> third<00:01:58.469> generation<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.670> back

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
basically third generation on the back

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520 
basically third generation on the back
just<00:02:00.149> some<00:02:00.299> stuff<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> different<00:02:01.110> languages

piece of technology with his internet

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.160 
piece of technology with his internet
pass-through<00:05:37.120> now<00:05:37.330> it's<00:05:37.510> been<00:05:37.720> made<00:05:37.930> even

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
pass-through now it's been made even

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.710 
pass-through now it's been made even
better<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.640> only<00:05:39.880> thing<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.480> I<00:05:40.540> would

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
better and the only thing that I would

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.710 
better and the only thing that I would
say<00:05:41.050> about<00:05:41.860> this<00:05:42.190> card<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.300> said<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.600> with<00:05:43.690> a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
say about this card and I said it with a

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.660 
say about this card and I said it with a
previous<00:05:44.170> one<00:05:44.380> make<00:05:45.070> sure<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.340> don't<00:05:45.430> have

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
previous one make sure you don't have

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.280 
previous one make sure you don't have
your<00:05:45.790> camera<00:05:46.210> settings<00:05:46.420> on<00:05:46.690> sleep<00:05:47.020> because

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
your camera settings on sleep because

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.050 
your camera settings on sleep because
the<00:05:47.380> minute<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.620> camera<00:05:47.980> goes<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.340> sleep<00:05:48.490> the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
the minute the camera goes to sleep the

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.480 
the minute the camera goes to sleep the
actual<00:05:49.420> SD<00:05:49.750> card<00:05:50.050> will<00:05:50.230> lose<00:05:50.470> power<00:05:50.770> so<00:05:51.370> if

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
actual SD card will lose power so if

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.680 
actual SD card will lose power so if
you're<00:05:51.610> going<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:51.850> use<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:52.330> kind<00:05:52.540> of

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
you're going to use this kind of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.480 
you're going to use this kind of
technology<00:05:53.080> where<00:05:53.530> you<00:05:53.560> are<00:05:53.800> kind<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.280> paired

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
technology where you are kind of paired

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.760 
technology where you are kind of paired
between<00:05:54.910> two<00:05:55.120> devices<00:05:55.660> then<00:05:56.200> make<00:05:56.410> sure<00:05:56.440> your

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
between two devices then make sure your

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.230 
between two devices then make sure your
camera<00:05:57.070> doesn't<00:05:57.250> go<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.490> sleep<00:05:57.820> because<00:05:58.000> you

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
camera doesn't go to sleep because you

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.850 
camera doesn't go to sleep because you
will<00:05:58.450> lose<00:05:58.660> connection<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.290> your<00:05:59.440> phone<00:05:59.650> and

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
will lose connection to your phone and

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.040 
will lose connection to your phone and
you'll<00:06:00.280> have<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.580> reboot<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.090> connection<00:06:01.570> so

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
you'll have to reboot the connection so

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.750 
you'll have to reboot the connection so
that<00:06:02.200> is<00:06:02.290> going<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.500> conclude<00:06:02.650> my<00:06:03.070> video<00:06:03.490> today
