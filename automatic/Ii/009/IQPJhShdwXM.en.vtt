00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.150 

I<00:00:37.850> know<00:00:38.850> my<00:00:39.149> dancers<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> teach<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I know my dancers because I teach them a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.180 
I know my dancers because I teach them a
few<00:00:41.340> times<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.850> week<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.559> most<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.860> been<00:00:44.040> with

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
few times a week and most have been with

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.930 
few times a week and most have been with
me<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> while<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.949> sometimes<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.370> cast

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
me for a while so sometimes I don't cast

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
me for a while so sometimes I don't cast
the<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.629> expect<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.769> want

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the way one would expect because I want

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.399 
the way one would expect because I want
to<00:00:50.010> push<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.670> bit<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.409> sometimes

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
to push them a little bit and sometimes

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.280 
to push them a little bit and sometimes
I<00:00:52.620> cast<00:00:52.890> exactly<00:00:53.519> how<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.089> expect<00:00:54.510> so

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
I cast exactly how one would expect so

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.799 
I cast exactly how one would expect so
it<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.589> know<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.769> really<00:00:55.829> depends<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.850> where<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it you know it really depends on where I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
it you know it really depends on where I
feel<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.589> dancers<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.940> their

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
feel the dancers are in their

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.530 
feel the dancers are in their
development<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.409> an<00:01:01.559> artist<00:01:02.089> whether<00:01:03.089> they

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
development as an artist whether they

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.630 
development as an artist whether they
need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.379> comfort<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.129> role<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
need to have some comfort in a role or

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.810 
need to have some comfort in a role or
if<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.300> be<00:01:06.690> pushed<00:01:07.580> into<00:01:08.580> something

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
if they need to be pushed into something

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.169 
if they need to be pushed into something
that's<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.560> comfortable<00:01:10.880> because<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
that's not comfortable because I think

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.240 
that's not comfortable because I think
that<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.810> need<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.050> continually<00:01:13.890> grow<00:01:14.039> as

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that they need to continually grow as

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.030 
that they need to continually grow as
artists<00:01:14.759> not<00:01:14.940> just<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.420> technicians

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 

well<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.120> it's<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.330> important

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
well I think that it's really important

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.950 
well I think that it's really important
to<00:01:22.080> prepare<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.800> generation<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.790> love<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to prepare each generation to love the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.470 
to prepare each generation to love the
theater<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.160> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> go<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:27.090> theater

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
theater and to want to go to the theater

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.530 
theater and to want to go to the theater
and<00:01:28.260> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.740> important<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.370> this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
and I think it's important in this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.650 
and I think it's important in this
especially<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.630> these<00:01:30.810> times<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:32.670> people

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
especially in these times that people

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.050 
especially in these times that people
know<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.380> seeing<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> live<00:01:35.070> performance<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
know what seeing a live performance is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.180 
know what seeing a live performance is
it's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:37.080> different<00:01:37.410> experience<00:01:37.620> than

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
it's a very different experience than

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's a very different experience than
watching<00:01:39.030> Netflix<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:40.340> watching<00:01:41.340> something

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
watching Netflix or watching something

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.020 
watching Netflix or watching something
on<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.450> computer<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.680> having<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.370> live

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
on your computer that having a live

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.380 
on your computer that having a live
experience<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.490> very<00:01:47.490> fulfilling<00:01:47.760> to<00:01:48.270> your

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
experience is very fulfilling to your

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880 
experience is very fulfilling to your
soul<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:48.720> completely<00:01:49.410> different<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
soul it's completely different and I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
soul it's completely different and I
think<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.220> important<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:50.820> young<00:01:51.090> people

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
think it's important that young people

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.880 
think it's important that young people
are<00:01:52.760> given<00:01:53.760> that<00:01:54.120> experience<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.170> learn<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
are given that experience and learn to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910 
are given that experience and learn to
hopefully<00:01:56.610> love<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.560> as

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hopefully love it and want to go as as

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.499 
hopefully love it and want to go as as
they<00:01:59.310> grow<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.390> keep<00:02:00.600> wanting<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.140> grow

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.569
