grab one of the sets of new wheels

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.180

with these changes you would think they

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.309

at $4.99 so if you're paying the same

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.969 
at $4.99 so if you're paying the same
amount<00:07:14.779> that<00:07:15.169> you<00:07:15.349> would<00:07:15.500> for<00:07:15.680> the<00:07:15.710> be<00:07:15.830> ready
