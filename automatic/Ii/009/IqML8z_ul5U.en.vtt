platinum lower right or it's supply and

precious<00:03:45.310> metal<00:03:45.759> platinum<00:03:46.599> is<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.049> precious

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
precious metal platinum is a precious

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.050 
precious metal platinum is a precious
metal<00:03:48.159> for<00:03:48.459> sure<00:03:48.669> and<00:03:48.970> there's<00:03:49.889> 14<00:03:50.889> times<00:03:51.579> as

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
metal for sure and there's 14 times as

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.640 
metal for sure and there's 14 times as
much<00:03:53.489> platt<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.970> 14<00:03:55.810> times<00:03:56.139> as<00:03:56.259> much<00:03:56.379> gold

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
much platt the 14 times as much gold

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.990 
much platt the 14 times as much gold
mine<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.040> platinum<00:03:57.310> if<00:03:57.609> they're<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.969> same

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
mine is platinum if they're the same

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.759 
mine is platinum if they're the same
price<00:03:58.469> so<00:03:59.489> that<00:04:00.489> means<00:04:00.819> that<00:04:01.810> there's<00:04:02.439> a<00:04:02.530> lot

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
price so that means that there's a lot

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.520 
price so that means that there's a lot
more<00:04:02.829> demand<00:04:03.459> for<00:04:03.549> gold<00:04:03.849> or<00:04:04.259> that<00:04:05.259> there's<00:04:05.469> a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
more demand for gold or that there's a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.679 
more demand for gold or that there's a
manipulation<00:04:06.129> that<00:04:06.430> gold<00:04:06.729> is<00:04:06.879> artificially

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
manipulation that gold is artificially

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.319 
manipulation that gold is artificially
manipulated<00:04:07.989> up<00:04:08.349> or<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:09.340> means<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.849> platinum

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
manipulated up or it means that platinum

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.559 
manipulated up or it means that platinum
is<00:04:10.769> artificially<00:04:12.060> related<00:04:13.060> low<00:04:13.239> or<00:04:13.539> a

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
is artificially related low or a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.550 
is artificially related low or a
combination<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:15.069> think<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.539> obvious<00:04:16.719> one<00:04:17.349> I

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
combination I think is the obvious one I

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.060 
combination I think is the obvious one I
think<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.699> demand<00:04:19.150> for<00:04:19.449> gold<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:20.049> much<00:04:20.469> higher

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
think the demand for gold is much higher

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.120 
think the demand for gold is much higher
than<00:04:21.459> platinum<00:04:22.650> essential<00:04:23.650> banks<00:04:24.010> are

than platinum essential banks are

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.379 
than platinum essential banks are

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
can be traded in one day so that's like

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.240 
indexes rolled you see these crazy
volumes<00:05:12.439> right<00:05:13.099> so<00:05:13.340> is<00:05:14.439> the<00:05:15.439> price<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.979> wheat

that<00:05:40.939> fun<00:05:41.210> stuff<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.839> they<00:05:42.800> realized<00:05:43.279> that

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399 
that fun stuff and they realized that

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.889 
that fun stuff and they realized that
after<00:05:43.939> they<00:05:44.060> grew<00:05:44.330> their<00:05:44.360> corn<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:46.099> was

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
after they grew their corn that it was

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.209 
after they grew their corn that it was
not<00:05:47.899> profitable<00:05:48.319> in<00:05:48.710> fact<00:05:48.949> they<00:05:49.129> would

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
not profitable in fact they would

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.829 
not profitable in fact they would
operate<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.639> loss<00:05:49.909> until<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.629> government

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
operate a loss until the government

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.920 
operate a loss until the government
subsidy<00:05:51.529> kicked<00:05:51.770> in<00:05:51.979> so<00:05:52.669> when<00:05:53.509> you<00:05:53.779> when<00:05:53.899> you

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
subsidy kicked in so when you when you

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.510 
subsidy kicked in so when you when you
eat<00:05:54.229> corn<00:05:54.560> products<00:05:54.949> you<00:05:55.129> are<00:05:55.159> buying

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
eat corn products you are buying

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.389 
eat corn products you are buying
something<00:05:55.879> that's<00:05:56.120> quote<00:05:56.479> below<00:05:57.229> market<00:05:58.099> cost

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:58.399 
something that's quote below market cost

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.149 
something that's quote below market cost
because<00:05:58.969> the<00:05:59.210> US<00:05:59.509> government<00:06:00.020> subsidizes<00:06:00.979> it

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
because the US government subsidizes it

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.869 
because the US government subsidizes it
right<00:06:01.430> so<00:06:02.180> that<00:06:02.870> is<00:06:03.050> they<00:06:03.879> artificially

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
right so that is they artificially

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.740 
right so that is they artificially
manipulated<00:06:05.750> price<00:06:06.229> lower<00:06:06.560> because<00:06:07.599> of<00:06:08.599> the

manipulated price lower because of the

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
goes below the mining craw cloth they

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.000 
goes below the mining craw cloth they
will<00:06:56.130> say<00:06:56.310> that<00:06:56.490> is<00:06:56.700> proof<00:06:57.060> of<00:06:58.010> manipulation

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
will say that is proof of manipulation

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.890 
will say that is proof of manipulation
well<00:07:00.260> what<00:07:01.260> kind<00:07:01.500> of<00:07:01.620> manipulation<00:07:02.900> what's

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
well what kind of manipulation what's

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.320 
well what kind of manipulation what's
going<00:07:04.200> on<00:07:04.350> right<00:07:04.710> and<00:07:05.010> the<00:07:05.490> manipulation<00:07:06.090> is

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
going on right and the manipulation is

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.220 
going on right and the manipulation is
often<00:07:07.200> in<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:08.540> subsidy<00:07:09.540> or<00:07:10.310> this<00:07:11.720> supply<00:07:12.720> well

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
often in a subsidy or this supply well

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.420 
often in a subsidy or this supply well
you<00:07:13.440> know<00:07:13.530> I'm<00:07:13.710> starting<00:07:14.010> to<00:07:14.130> go<00:07:14.250> off<00:07:14.280> on

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
you know I'm starting to go off on

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.290 
you know I'm starting to go off on
tangents<00:07:14.510> but<00:07:15.510> basically<00:07:16.220> if<00:07:17.300> you're

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
tangents but basically if you're

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.660 
tangents but basically if you're
concerned<00:07:18.780> about<00:07:19.050> nip<00:07:19.680> ulation<00:07:20.130> and<00:07:20.250> ratios

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
concerned about nip ulation and ratios

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.700 
concerned about nip ulation and ratios
look<00:07:21.570> at<00:07:21.780> the<00:07:22.050> platinum<00:07:22.680> to<00:07:23.100> gold<00:07:23.490> ratio

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
look at the platinum to gold ratio

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.970 
look at the platinum to gold ratio
platinum<00:07:25.710> there<00:07:26.400> are<00:07:26.750> 14<00:07:27.750> times<00:07:28.560> as<00:07:28.860> much

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
platinum there are 14 times as much

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.270 
platinum there are 14 times as much
gold-<00:07:29.940> platinum<00:07:30.600> and<00:07:30.720> the<00:07:31.320> prices<00:07:31.920> are<00:07:32.100> about

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 
gold- platinum and the prices are about

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.280 
gold- platinum and the prices are about
the<00:07:32.760> same<00:07:33.060> and<00:07:33.800> is<00:07:34.800> platinum<00:07:35.550> being

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.290 
the same and is platinum being

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.310 
the same and is platinum being
manipulated<00:07:37.290> down<00:07:37.530> is<00:07:37.830> gold<00:07:38.700> being

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.320 
manipulated down is gold being

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.680 
manipulated down is gold being
manipulated<00:07:40.320> up<00:07:40.500> or<00:07:40.710> is<00:07:41.190> it<00:07:41.310> just<00:07:41.580> that<00:07:41.730> the

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
manipulated up or is it just that the

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.590 
manipulated up or is it just that the
demand<00:07:43.080> for<00:07:43.440> gold<00:07:43.650> is<00:07:44.010> a<00:07:44.070> lot<00:07:44.580> higher<00:07:45.090> than

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:45.600 
demand for gold is a lot higher than

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.200 
demand for gold is a lot higher than
platinum<00:07:46.290> and<00:07:46.710> a<00:07:47.070> lot<00:07:47.310> of<00:07:47.340> this<00:07:47.550> demand<00:07:47.940> is

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210 
platinum and a lot of this demand is

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.690 
platinum and a lot of this demand is
coming<00:07:48.600> from<00:07:48.660> the<00:07:48.810> central<00:07:49.140> bank's<00:07:49.500> so<00:07:50.130> think

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.700 
coming from the central bank's so think

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.500 
coming from the central bank's so think
on<00:07:50.820> that<00:07:51.110> have<00:07:52.110> a<00:07:52.200> good<00:07:52.380> day
