how<00:01:27.360> visually<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:28.020> wants<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> tell<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> story

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
how visually he wants to tell the story

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
how visually he wants to tell the story
and<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> takes<00:01:29.520> many<00:01:29.880> forms<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.540> could<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and it takes many forms it could be like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.350 
and it takes many forms it could be like
a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.439> sketch<00:01:32.310> he's<00:01:32.549> done<00:01:32.759> himself<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
a little sketch he's done himself it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
a little sketch he's done himself it
could<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.600> tear<00:01:33.869> sheets<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.680> magazine

could be tear sheets out of a magazine
it<00:01:35.729> could<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.329> sort<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.020> philosophical

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
it could be a sort of a philosophical

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.830 
it could be a sort of a philosophical
manifesto<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:39.030> he<00:01:39.090> wants<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> approach

to<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.369> always<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.360> source<00:01:51.630> material<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to go is always the source material and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.100 
to go is always the source material and
to<00:01:52.979> break<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.640> source<00:01:53.909> material<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to break down the source material to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.590 
to break down the source material to
examine<00:01:55.619> any<00:01:55.799> references<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.060> find<00:01:57.360> that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
examine any references you can find that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
do a project together is you don't stick

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.820 
do a project together is you don't stick
to<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:41.970> period<00:03:42.599> it's<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.170> do<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.319> mash-up

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
to one period it's like you do a mash-up

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.449 
to one period it's like you do a mash-up
you<00:03:44.129> make<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.489> modern<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.150> well<00:03:46.069> is<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.129> hard

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you make it modern as well is that hard

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.289 
you make it modern as well is that hard
um<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.659> think<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.709> really<00:03:50.430> about<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.430> clear

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
um I think it's really about to be clear

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.009 
um I think it's really about to be clear
everything<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:57.540> version<00:03:57.810> of

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
starting point certainly in that second

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.479 
starting point certainly in that second
decade<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.530> 2000<00:04:07.530> was<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:09.920> we<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.129> use

year<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.090> book<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.449> set<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.930> summer<00:04:19.169> of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
year that the book is set the summer of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.460 
year that the book is set the summer of
22<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.100> was<00:04:20.160> published<00:04:20.639> in<00:04:20.820> 25<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
22 it was published in 25 and it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.710 
22 it was published in 25 and it
foreshadows<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:23.280> crash<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.669> 29

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
foreshadows the crash of 29

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.790 
foreshadows the crash of 29
so<00:04:24.780> we<00:04:24.900> use<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:26.250> decade<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:28.050> a

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
so we use that that decade as a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.580 
so we use that that decade as a
reference<00:04:29.460> point<00:04:29.630> but<00:04:30.630> then<00:04:30.840> choices<00:04:31.440> are

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
reference point but then choices are

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.790 
reference point but then choices are
made<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:33.980> make<00:04:36.020> what's<00:04:37.020> happening<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
made to make what's happening in the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.830 
made to make what's happening in the
story<00:04:38.040> clearer<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> contemporary<00:04:39.540> audience

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
story clearer to a contemporary audience

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.500 
story clearer to a contemporary audience
so<00:04:40.320> for<00:04:40.530> instance<00:04:40.920> all<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.430> cars<00:04:42.060> in<00:04:42.300> our

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
so for instance all the cars in our

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.620 
so for instance all the cars in our
movie<00:04:42.990> are<00:04:43.410> in<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> latter<00:04:44.100> part<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.180> 2011

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
movie are in the latter part of the 2011

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.610 
movie are in the latter part of the 2011
pimped<00:04:46.590> up<00:04:46.740> -<00:04:47.030> well<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.360> only<00:04:48.870> car<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.470> is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
pimped up - well the only car that is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.310 
pimped up - well the only car that is
pimped<00:04:50.040> up<00:04:50.190> they<00:04:50.490> don't<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:50.970> more<00:04:51.390> then<00:04:52.140> it

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
pimped up they don't know more then it

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.860 
pimped up they don't know more then it
could<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:52.920> been<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.640> period<00:04:54.000> because<00:04:54.840> a

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
could have been in that period because a

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.430 
could have been in that period because a
Duesenberg<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:56.310> would<00:04:56.490> buy<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:58.140> Duesenberg

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
Duesenberg you would buy the Duesenberg

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.600 
Duesenberg you would buy the Duesenberg
and<00:04:59.220> then<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.760> would<00:04:59.940> have<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.570> chassis

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
and then you would have the chassis

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.640 
and then you would have the chassis
dressed<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.880> fitted<00:05:03.210> out<00:05:03.360> by<00:05:03.600> a<00:05:03.630> coach<00:05:04.020> makeup

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
dressed and fitted out by a coach makeup

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.240 
dressed and fitted out by a coach makeup
yeah<00:05:04.950> who<00:05:05.730> would<00:05:05.850> actually<00:05:06.030> receive<00:05:07.250> the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
yeah who would actually receive the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.310 
yeah who would actually receive the
chassis<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:08.850> then<00:05:09.060> put<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.510> body<00:05:09.720> on<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.110> car

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
chassis and then put the body on the car

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.560 
chassis and then put the body on the car
and<00:05:10.650> stuff<00:05:10.980> so<00:05:12.470> they're<00:05:13.470> all<00:05:13.620> cars<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.580> are

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
and stuff so they're all cars that are

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.320 
and stuff so they're all cars that are
not<00:05:16.050> anachronistic<00:05:17.040> apart<00:05:17.790> from<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.090> fact

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
not anachronistic apart from the fact

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.950 
not anachronistic apart from the fact
that<00:05:18.480> we<00:05:19.310> they're<00:05:20.310> all<00:05:20.490> from<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.030> latter<00:05:21.270> 20s

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
that we they're all from the latter 20s

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.200 
that we they're all from the latter 20s
rather<00:05:22.770> than<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.130> early<00:05:23.460> 20s<00:05:23.850> now<00:05:24.030> that

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
rather than the early 20s now that

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.150 
rather than the early 20s now that
decision<00:05:24.660> was<00:05:24.810> made<00:05:25.020> because<00:05:25.290> if<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.710> look<00:05:25.919> at

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
decision was made because if you look at

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.210 
decision was made because if you look at
cars<00:05:26.600> say<00:05:28.850> 1919<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:30.090> 1922<00:05:31.020> they<00:05:31.830> all<00:05:32.010> look<00:05:32.190> like

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
cars say 1919 to 1922 they all look like

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.610 
cars say 1919 to 1922 they all look like
the<00:05:32.790> cars<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.419> keystone<00:05:33.960> cop<00:05:34.350> would<00:05:34.590> have

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
the cars that a keystone cop would have

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.280 
the cars that a keystone cop would have
and<00:05:35.100> our<00:05:35.550> association<00:05:36.540> is<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:37.110> they're

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
and our association is that they're

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.550 
and our association is that they're
comical<00:05:38.010> or<00:05:38.480> there<00:05:39.480> isn't<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.990> kind<00:05:40.320> of

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
comical or there isn't a kind of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.310 
comical or there isn't a kind of
inherent<00:05:41.240> murder<00:05:42.240> we<00:05:42.450> don't<00:05:42.630> associate<00:05:43.200> it

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
inherent murder we don't associate it

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.820 
inherent murder we don't associate it
with<00:05:43.650> modernity<00:05:44.310> or<00:05:44.669> sleekness<00:05:45.360> or<00:05:45.900> fast<00:05:46.470> cars

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
with modernity or sleekness or fast cars

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.240 
with modernity or sleekness or fast cars
or<00:05:47.310> kind<00:05:47.820> of<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.419> know<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:48.780> sexy<00:05:49.380> car<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:50.100> you

might want to have their sort of
jalopies<00:05:52.860> yeah<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.669> so<00:05:54.000> those<00:05:54.690> decisions

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
jalopies yeah and so those decisions

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.200
