00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.220
 so this is a review of smart set-top boxes 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 otherwise Iâ€™m already tired of writing to people 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.340
 my husband decided to shoot a video for what it is 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.730
 I ordered one more for sale 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.619
 Now that such a box 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 good stuff advises everyone just 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.679
 I have a regular TV not smarts 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 At home Wi-Fi is how it is done here 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:39.570
 This thing is connected via hdmi 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.300
 cable to the TV also goes wire 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.300
 power connects here 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.899
 including food 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:56.930
 included all the download went 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:03.650
 The mouse in the set does not go comfortably of course 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 hand now I plug the mouse wait 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.570
 the game is plugged in already loaded 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.570
 android on TV now see everything 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 Here is such a small thing is burning 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.979
 the only negative in this thing is not 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 power button but nothing from the outlet 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:41.430
 I choose nothing buggy all here choosing 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 God's one here but I can already boot 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.770
 re-turn off that was all 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.770
 apparently turned off turned on 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:05.270
 Andrew is loading again, waiting for him 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.700
 just the tv updated was old 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.050

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.110
 the main thing that was at home wi-fi still waiting 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 everything is just like normal 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.740
 tablets only that's not the sensor that's the mouse 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.110
 it works for me, that 's what you want 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.640
 can browser open chrome games there 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.510
 chrome powder opening 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:58.840
 I will surf the Internet there all that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.060
 do you want music movies games anything 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:10.300
 what can be done on the tablet 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:12.540
 something can be done here too 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.220
 still tell 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.860
 settings let's see here writes 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.070
 review of course may be stupid but at least 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.640
 explain a little miracle like wifi and 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.090
 bluetooth 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:36.300
 internet he has it all for 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.170
 developers about tablet pc so 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.060
 information address is not that kernel version 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.390
 the build number is 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.580
 android 4 1 1 did not update anything of course 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.510
 but I think nothing worth the role of vanity 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.239
 in order, well, everything is clear to all this thing 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.019
 just unreal cool 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.019
 Like everyone for now
