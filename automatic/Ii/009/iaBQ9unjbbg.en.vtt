happened to the original wiring it's
it's<00:00:21.550> long<00:00:21.820> gone<00:00:21.849> so<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.920> to<00:00:24.189> pass<00:00:24.369> inspection

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
it's long gone so but to pass inspection

minute and it grounds out to here

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.830 
minute and it grounds out to here
whenever<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.220> switch<00:00:54.310> is<00:00:54.580> pressed<00:00:54.840> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.710 
that the connector assembly so that
thing<00:02:35.130> right<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:35.489> rotates<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.450> full

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
thing right there rotates with full

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.559 
thing right there rotates with full
rotation<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.560> steering<00:02:37.769> wheel<00:02:38.540> all<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
rotation of your steering wheel all I

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.850 
rotation of your steering wheel all I
had<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.350> don't<00:02:40.410> know<00:02:40.560> what<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.769> was

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
had to do is I don't know what it was

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
had to do is I don't know what it was
factory<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:41.790> somebody<00:02:42.150> long<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.420> go<00:02:42.510> ahead

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
factory but somebody long to go ahead

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.050 
factory but somebody long to go ahead
replace<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.190> what<00:02:44.459> I'm<00:02:44.549> doing<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.940> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
replace this so what I'm doing is I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.610 
replace this so what I'm doing is I
hooked<00:02:45.239> up<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.480> wire<00:02:46.519> there<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
hooked up a wire there you can see it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.610 
hooked up a wire there you can see it
hooked<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.860> wire<00:02:51.170> ran<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.290> through<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
hooked up a wire ran it through that

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.069 
hooked up a wire ran it through that
little<00:02:52.769> hole<00:02:53.480> now<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:54.570> going<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> put<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> on

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
little hole now I'm going to put it on

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.220 
little hole now I'm going to put it on
here<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.040> rotates<00:02:56.430> freely<00:02:56.870> now<00:02:57.870> anytime

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
here and this rotates freely now anytime

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.860 
here and this rotates freely now anytime
I<00:02:58.410> ground<00:02:58.769> out<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.160> wire<00:02:59.400> my<00:03:00.030> horn<00:03:00.269> works

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.920 

so<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:08.280> got<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> branch<00:03:09.510> steering<00:03:09.810> wheel

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
so now we got is a branch steering wheel

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
so now we got is a branch steering wheel
switch<00:03:10.260> I'm<00:03:11.250> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> take<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.640> little

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
switch I'm going to take that little

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.330 
switch I'm going to take that little
connector<00:03:12.210> hook<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> my<00:03:12.960> switch<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.500> as

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
connector hook up to my switch and as

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.850 
connector hook up to my switch and as
you<00:03:14.460> can<00:03:14.550> see<00:03:15.020> that<00:03:16.020> spring<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:16.710> is

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
you can see that spring right there is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.750 
you can see that spring right there is
always<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.250> hooked<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> my

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
always going to be hooked up to my

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.300 
always going to be hooked up to my
steering<00:03:17.970> wheel<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.920> going<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> ground

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
steering wheel and it's going to ground

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.850 
steering wheel and it's going to ground
out<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:24.420> kind<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.660> work<00:03:24.840> I'll<00:03:25.620> show<00:03:25.800> you

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
out and it's kind of work I'll show you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.920 
out and it's kind of work I'll show you
here<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.130> minute

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
here in a minute

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.220 
here in a minute
then<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.990> take<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.320> hub<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
then you take this hub and you see that

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.660 
then you take this hub and you see that
hole<00:03:31.410> right<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:32.100> lines<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.490> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
hole right there it lines up with that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.850 
hole right there it lines up with that
hole<00:03:34.580> alright<00:03:35.580> well<00:03:35.850> blue<00:03:36.690> wire<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.650> had

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
hole alright well blue wire that I had

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.150 
hole alright well blue wire that I had
going<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:41.280> black<00:03:41.460> wire<00:03:41.730> my<00:03:43.160> steering

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
going to the the black wire my steering

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.790 
going to the the black wire my steering
column<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.720> taped<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.380> it's<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.590> all

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
column and it taped up so it's not all

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.070 
column and it taped up so it's not all
ugly<00:03:47.070> but<00:03:47.790> anyway<00:03:48.090> long<00:03:48.270> story<00:03:48.300> short<00:03:48.540> goes

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
ugly but anyway long story short goes

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.800 
ugly but anyway long story short goes
and<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.940> goes<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.970> other<00:03:54.120> connector<00:03:54.630> on<00:03:54.720> my

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and it goes to the other connector on my

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.940 
and it goes to the other connector on my
horn<00:03:55.080> my<00:03:55.230> horn<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.710> not<00:03:55.920> grounded<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.890> a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
horn my horn is not grounded like a

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.110 
horn my horn is not grounded like a
normal<00:03:59.580> horn<00:03:59.820> would<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:01.880> grounded<00:04:02.880> through

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
normal horn would be it grounded through

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.640 
normal horn would be it grounded through
the<00:04:03.270> steering<00:04:03.570> column<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.430> have<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.420> hot

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
the steering column so I have the hot

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.740 
the steering column so I have the hot
I'm<00:04:07.650> just<00:04:07.830> kind<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.010> threw<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.400> there<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
I'm just kind of threw it on there the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.449 
I'm just kind of threw it on there the
hot<00:04:09.930> wires<00:04:10.200> hooked<00:04:10.560> up<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.950> positive<00:04:10.980> it's

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
hot wires hooked up to the positive it's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.930 
hot wires hooked up to the positive it's
always<00:04:11.700> hot<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:13.370> whenever<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.489> hit<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.640> horn

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
always hot and whenever you hit the horn

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.870 
always hot and whenever you hit the horn
it<00:04:15.870> beeps<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:17.220> there<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.580> that's<00:04:17.700> how

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
it beeps and so there you go that's how

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.380 
it beeps and so there you go that's how
to<00:04:18.770> expediently<00:04:19.770> wire<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.549> horn<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.209> wire

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
to expediently wire up a horn you wire

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.260 
to expediently wire up a horn you wire
hot<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:22.350> it's<00:04:22.500> always<00:04:22.620> hot<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.270> then

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
hot to it so it's always hot and then

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.370 
hot to it so it's always hot and then
you<00:04:24.330> run<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.600> ground<00:04:24.810> all<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.110> way<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> your

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
you run the ground all the way to your

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.470 
you run the ground all the way to your
steering<00:04:25.740> column<00:04:26.040> or<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> button<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.150> your<00:04:27.180> dash

on your dash or the other prong on do

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.020 
on your dash or the other prong on do
what<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.900> did<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:38.250> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.520> be<00:04:38.580> connected<00:04:38.940> to

what I did is going to be connected to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.730 
what I did is going to be connected to
the<00:04:39.150> metal<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:39.600> whenever<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.590> switch

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
the metal so whenever the switch

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.250 
the metal so whenever the switch
connects<00:04:41.250> all<00:04:42.210> it's<00:04:42.450> doing<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.810> grounding

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
connects all it's doing is grounding

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.290 
connects all it's doing is grounding
itself<00:04:43.560> out<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.400> frame<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.850> car<00:04:45.000> or
