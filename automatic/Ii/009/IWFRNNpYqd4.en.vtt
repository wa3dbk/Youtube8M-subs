have like a huge respect for different
things<00:02:46.750> yeah<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.650> think<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.160> there<00:02:48.610> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
things yeah I think that there is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.850 
things yeah I think that there is
interesting<00:02:51.040> balance<00:02:51.370> between<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.860> written

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
interesting balance between the written

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.800 
interesting balance between the written
material<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.550> compost<00:02:55.000> material<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
material and compost material and the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.600 
material and compost material and the
improvised<00:02:56.410> materiality<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.610> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
improvised materiality of this is to to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.870 
improvised materiality of this is to to
construct<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.480> dialogue<00:03:02.380> between<00:03:03.070> not<00:03:03.850> only

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
construct this dialogue between not only

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.870 
construct this dialogue between not only
two<00:03:04.270> instruments<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:04.990> two<00:03:05.170> souls
