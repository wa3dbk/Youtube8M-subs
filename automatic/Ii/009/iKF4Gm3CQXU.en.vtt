and my son is four and a half months old

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.240 
and my son is four and a half months old
and<00:00:24.119> he<00:00:24.840> kind<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.260> doesn't<00:00:25.500> understand<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and he kind of doesn't understand it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
and he kind of doesn't understand it
just<00:00:26.550> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.849> looks<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> touch

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that's for sure so I'm sure when he

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.430 
that's for sure so I'm sure when he
figures<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.809> press<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.260> make

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.380 
still not an age that he really grasps
what<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.420> do<00:01:38.630> how<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.080> make<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.970> how<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.030> make<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
what to do how to make it how to make it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.510 
what to do how to make it how to make it
make<00:01:41.540> noise<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.500> he<00:01:42.619> does<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.160> look<00:01:43.310> at

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
make noise but he does like to look at

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.210 
make noise but he does like to look at
it<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.930> I'm<00:01:44.930> sure<00:01:45.290> once<00:01:45.560> he<00:01:45.680> figures<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.130> out

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
it and I'm sure once he figures it out

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.109 
it and I'm sure once he figures it out
he's<00:01:46.460> gonna<00:01:46.640> love<00:01:46.910> it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
he's gonna love it

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.080 
he's gonna love it
so<00:01:47.360> what<00:01:47.930> child<00:01:48.200> doesn't<00:01:48.440> love<00:01:48.740> noisemakers

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090
