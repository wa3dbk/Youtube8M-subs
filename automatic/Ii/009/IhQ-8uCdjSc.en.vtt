00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.210
 Patrick at the start and asks for home 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.340
 has been frankfurt branches and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.480
 Although so cool, everything was sucking video 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.300
 you will see or you will have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 probably already seen 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.890
 now it is as it always comes 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 again the questions on how long do you have 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.340
 what are you doing has ever 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.550
 Skin problems because of dairy products and such 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.189
 So in general it's the same with me 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.240
 So I wanted to be sooner than I am 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 now 27 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 I always have one with 20 at home 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 a bit so larifari trained so yes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 a little bit sixpack and a little bit here 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300
 about some pushups so I have to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.530
 Of course I say I have a good one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 gracious but I never got it right 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.539
 trained yes I started to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 train in november last year 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.820
 So in 2013, and as such only times that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 I have such a comparison I have 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.039
 started 36er biceps and now have 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.050
 current second ttc cell instead so 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.109
 also good things on it in the end 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.030
 yes in general so I've never problems 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.110
 to have dairy products because I have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 I decided to do so from the beginning 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.320
 ways to listen so I have the karl 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 his videos was seen and was for me 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 that was simply plausible vegan 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 the right one is conditioned by that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.100
 I stop selling dog food before 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.470
 I told the people what the dog was 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.110
 to eat and also for a human 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.680
 plant's eye looks like this point 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.619
 end of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 and that's why I say hey I am 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.140
 vegan and abdominal muscles on me now 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.100
 have first about two weeks approximately 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.350
 Let's have a look 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.080
 always attaches only two weeks 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.270
 trained at home 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.000
 Part two weeks two months that is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.200
 Pull-ups push-ups six pay squats 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 and keep it a bit at home 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.110
 killed and then I'm in 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.480
 gone gym 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.660
 The first three months in the gym 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.790
 I have a fat calorie deficit 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.140
 I spent 2200 calories 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.090
 I also started mine directly 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.610
 I'm now tracking calories 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.440
 in 3700 so I really three 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.750
 wasted time in principle for months 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.220
 and since then I now have 3700 calories 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.530
 food is really blatant with me 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.110
 onward I do really lousy games 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.070
 So I realized myself every day I 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.310
 can soon see the mirror 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.290
 like my muscles grow so people I 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 can you really only say yes if you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.480
 eat normal then yes waived 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.910
 At least that way, shit that is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 a waste product a waste product of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.660
 The industry will sell you as 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.220
 well yes people get pimples the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.720
 People get pleon against the shit 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.290
 The stomach problems is not at all 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.390
 be good 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 in addition to rice protein even if it is not so 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.060
 Good taste on it 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.350
 you want you to want your body 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.459
 health give then is not so 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.530
 important if it tastes good now 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.380
 so sorry is just so pure point 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.420
 1.2 in the matter is yes screwed the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.590
 meat consumption is back in the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.690
 week at most once a week 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 meat little dairy no 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.640
 lean quark lean quark calcium from the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.680
 Bone out around the calcium or the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 Body takes calcium out of the bones and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.920
 the calcium from the lean quark too 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 win that goes against only or her 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.610
 even starts - yes why are they 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.500
 whole bone fracture disease from the puro 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.280
 such a shit is connected with it 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.350
 people therefore let it be and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.120
 Just try it out I have it now 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.560
 meanwhile I have a recipe 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.090
 videos i go to eat with you 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.739
 I'll take you with me I'll show you that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.239
 you can live normally if you 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.519
 vegan are you just take others 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.489
 things people say to me the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.840
 can not live vegan yes that is for 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.060
 me a lie that is one for me 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.769
 ice cold it is just changeover 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.690
 and the people who say something like that are 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.170
 just too lazy to change it 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.570
 same time rice pudding so there's 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.250
 shavings as it goes is everything you 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.450
 You should be covered with soy products 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.830
 But now and then you do so 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.540
 product is perfectly alright when 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.299
 someone is hurting 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.950
 next to it so there is no question 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.799
 So there is really no 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.420
 excuse people pulls vegan is im 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.760
 People come to feel better 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.920
 I have not met anyone yet 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 who said I eat 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.489
 because of the first tried the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.000
 I'm told I'm fed again 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.579
 normal 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 nobody is not a single one why is it 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.329
 probably because everyone is better 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.939
 feel obviously not meant to go the 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.079
 simply dairy and 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.849
 omit meat products without 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.920
 any soy products driver is that 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.099
 I also seems in danger because vegan 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.170
 does not mean straight healthy so that looks 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.609
 whole thing from my friends yes and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.190
 that's why you have to think about it 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.489
 Just try it if you go 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.599
 also wanted to make castle games is 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.669
 vegan by fruit purely shoots you 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.940
 vegetables in if you want to shoot yourself 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.320
 another dock or something yes that is 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.389
 it does not have to be that way 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.460
 I like it once in a while you can 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.650

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.599
 you're so fine you'll never be again 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.250
 want something different and just today 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.699

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.560

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.919
 wampe follow yes you have the video 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.080
 already appears because of that 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.520
 That's where people think we are now 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.449
 ye can not be driving expensive 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.030
 Consumption down finds alternative and 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.979
 People simply go vegan 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.599
 vegan is the best thing that does to the body 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.400
 and nowadays could be in the supermarket 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.870
 can buy what yes think this 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.409
 history earlier we have meat 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.090

 But there are supermarkets you have to 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.190

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.409

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.560
 you do not need to eat just buy 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.090
