00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.799
 the audi a7 sportback plays on two tables that of the large sedan and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.769
 at the same time the sports coupe 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.250
 by skilfully manning the other models of the audi a7 brand 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.340
 between orange and vienna is of a manufacturing quality per month while 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 than on a mass produced car 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 thank you 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.650
 forty years 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.510
 the sfc shots on nearly five meters with the house audition style 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.210
 we have been here with the grille and the look people who are of the most beautiful 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.090
 effect 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750
 but the choice piece of this body is without a doubt 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.580
 back stifle 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.260
 it even incorporates an office that deploys as soon as the car reaches 130 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.780
 as soon as you climb inside you notice a cozy atmosphere thanks to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.090
 mix of beautiful wood materials aluminum and leather 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.070
 the cockpit is close to that of an audi a8 and especially the a7 sportback which 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.260
 is a real four-seater car the seats is set at all levels and 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.200
 the most pleasant probably the dashboard of his horizontal line which gives 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 the impression of being in a kind of cocoon 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.220
 as soon as you press the pedal a feeling pleasure despite its near 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.250
 five meters long and 1700 70 kilos the set is very pleasant to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 drive 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.650
 it changes course without trembling blows but since then the steering wheel a 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.110
 increased responsiveness with quattro all-wheel drive 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 the whole thing shows a stability of a perfect balance and if it is necessary 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 sometimes climbed into the towers to revive the decline is inconsequential 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.170
 on the front axle 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 the German is also putting on a whole range dedicated to driving with 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.160
 the head-up display another strong point the near vision 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.469
 with victory pending this summer and this a7 sportback in the fall that 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.039
 put on novelties and succeeded his bet 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.709
 Poetry and fun to drive the plate stands out from the others 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.629
 cars on this segment 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.769
 the consumption turns more around the 6 liters per 100 km obviously it is necessary 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.620
 to count nearly 60000 euros for a thermal version
