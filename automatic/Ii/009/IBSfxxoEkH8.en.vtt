00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:05.360
 Hello dear friends and today we 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.640
 talk about root rights about how to 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.550
 establish and what ultimately they 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.990
 we will be given and so generally what is root 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.450
 root is the main account 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.679
 administrator of this phone or how 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.720
 say super user 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.580
 if you have this access you can 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.779
 use many features which 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.000
 not normally 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.890
 if you have root rights to android then 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.930
 can change system files can 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.760
 change subject can change shortcuts 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070
 can remove standard applications 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.620
 who you had on your phone 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.719
 but you couldn't do anything with them 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.719
 how was it sewn into your system 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.899
 phone and if you want you can delete 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.729
 even play market with root access 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.949
 can access programs 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.539
 which first non-root was not 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.510
 for example programs that can 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.339
 hacking games at the end of the video for example i 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.780
 I'll show it 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.530
 There are three types of root-rights full 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.449
 constant 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.879
 and for sure everyone uses time 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.069
 exactly the full view of root-rights as 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.769
 there are no restrictions and you can 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.780
 I wanted to use as much as you wanted 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.479
 would say that not all devices can 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.640
 get root rights just on some 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.070
 of these, unlock protection is installed and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.009
 smartphone protection does not allow to make 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.469
 no changes to the system sections and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.369
 gives it to install a program like 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.469
 super user 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.450
 on such devices without complete 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.719
 unlocking get root not right 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.850
 get root at all you can 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.770
 get several ways and one 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.829
 of which there will be a simple download for now 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.659
 the framaroot application file and executing 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.969
 a few taps of the internal and 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.659
 running our smartphone we would already be 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.749
 holders of root rights but samsung galaxy 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.090
 s4 is not that simple for this 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.520
 phone you need to use another wind 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.249
 the caching is rutting through the computer 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.159
 using the jelly one but we will 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.770
 put through one so guys we are now 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.780
 we put root rights on samsung galaxy s4 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:07.609
 and then so how is the impact shorter 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.310
 if you have this samsung kies you need 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.690
 turn off tasks well, in general, what is connected 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.550
 or you can delete and then halls 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100
 but I think that in the task manager it 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.740
 you can simply turn off the task with it 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.950
 what is connected with the keys all hike with us 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.280
 there is nothing like that we turn off the antivirus 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.390
 nothing good okay principle so 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:35.180
 now there still need to download usb driver 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.020
 for samsung, go there in google and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.190
 Now let 's do the phone so it should be 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.650
 turn off turned off 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.670
 so now we translate the phone mode 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.070
 then stitched to her then I will explain it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.960
 volume down button power off button 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.960
 or lock and middle button 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.870
 we simultaneously clamp and such 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.540
 minimum non-standard type pops up 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.810
 a warning 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.710
 but if i want a download 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.510
 in short, we can click well to raise 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:23.070
 up to translate into 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.760
 well let's go up all now need it 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.720
 insert 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 esbe so we insert the phone so but 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:40.790
 while on the phone we do nothing 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:46.080
 standby now we run 1 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:49.380
 Here we had our phone under 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.600
 name com 5 now take so 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.200
 probably closer did I will 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.580
 shoot what we're doing here is our screen 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.700

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.989
 field by piece it was possible for the firmware 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.040
 auto reboot everything is already there 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:19.040
 everything is set in principle, you can click 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.040
 start 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:31.840
 recovery goes all work already done well 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.840
 look like that's it 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:42.220

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:51.550
 my phone turns on everything is fine 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:55.800

 mass beatbox this is such a thing 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:44.689
 you need these files you need 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:48.499
 for root rights and without root 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.960
 rights will not work offline 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:56.270
 mode, that is , any 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:00.349

 adjusts became writes all set and 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:19.270
 so we actually gave the installation 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:22.460
 root rights there is such a program freedom 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.339
 with it you can hack the game well 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.439
 This is one of the features of root-rights. 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:31.100
 well, let's all be known for everything 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:34.250

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.380
 in this freedom hack this game that is 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.450

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.340
 go in freedom find there this game 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.300
 Only this list of games that can be 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.550
 hack and we need included internet and 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:51.260
 it is desirable that it was wi-fi 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:54.440
 they're just handing out well that's subway surf y 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.280
 we are coming in now we will make small 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.990
 operations, that is, weâ€™ll go into coins 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.410
 that is where we have these coins and 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:08.920
 sell pretend type we them 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.920
 really buy we go shop 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:21.840
 Well, we choose the largest number from us 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.210
 pops up such a bullshit type 117 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.000
 dollars for 100 million coin catalog 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.580
 two hundred and see where it will take place 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.889
 this payment it as free card xxxi 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.850
 some sort of room yet 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.850
 click buy 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.100
 payment is made with us nothing 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:42.000
 withdrew even if the card is tied or 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.980
 not attached no matter we already have these 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.290
 coins that is, you can see that a million 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:51.350
 two hundred we have become more well actually 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.350
