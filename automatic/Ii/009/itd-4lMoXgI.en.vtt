now in a complicated pattern there would

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.010 
now in a complicated pattern there would
be<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:23.460> cords<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> pull<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
be a lot of those cords to pull and the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
be a lot of those cords to pull and the
children<00:01:25.350> whose<00:01:25.530> job<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> would

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
children whose job it was to do it would

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
children whose job it was to do it would
get<00:01:26.729> tired<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.299> pull<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> wrong<00:01:27.689> cords<00:01:28.079> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
get tired and pull the wrong cords and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.389 
get tired and pull the wrong cords and
maybe<00:01:28.350> ruin<00:01:28.649> a<00:01:28.710> week's<00:01:28.890> work

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
maybe ruin a week's work

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.200 
maybe ruin a week's work
so<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.229> 1725<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.680> Lyonnaise<00:01:32.490> Weaver<00:01:32.880> called

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.990 
so in 1725 a Lyonnaise Weaver called
Vasily<00:01:33.689> Busha<00:01:34.079> solved<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> problem<00:01:35.220> because

needle the cross needles and where there
was<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> hole<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.660> needles<00:02:33.989> stayed<00:02:34.200> put

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
was a hole the needles stayed put

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.600 
was a hole the needles stayed put
because<00:02:34.620> they<00:02:34.709> came<00:02:34.860> through<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> holes<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
because they came through the holes and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.550 
because they came through the holes and
where<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.239> was<00:02:36.360> not<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> hole<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.440> the

where there was not a hole as in the
case<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> these<00:02:38.160> four<00:02:38.400> needles<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
case of these four needles here the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.290 
case of these four needles here the
paper<00:02:39.959> pushed<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> cross<00:02:41.160> needles<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
paper pushed the cross needles so that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.970 
paper pushed the cross needles so that
all<00:02:42.480> four<00:02:42.780> needles<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.200> all<00:02:43.440> their<00:02:43.680> threads

all four needles and all their threads

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
all four needles and all their threads
operated<00:02:44.550> simultaneously<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:45.660> this

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.569 

and<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:52.469> change<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.890> pattern<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.250> simply

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
and to change the pattern you simply

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.920 
and to change the pattern you simply
move<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.879> paper<00:02:54.060> along<00:02:54.299> one<00:02:54.480> row<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.750> holes

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
move the paper along one row of holes

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.039 
move the paper along one row of holes
but<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.010> paper<00:02:56.189> tour<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> Weaver<00:02:57.810> is

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
but the paper tour and the Weaver is

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.209 
but the paper tour and the Weaver is
placed<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> wrong<00:02:58.769> position

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
placed in the wrong position

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.119 
placed in the wrong position
so<00:02:59.760> around<00:03:00.239> 1740<00:03:00.900> another<00:03:01.319> Weaver<00:03:01.620> from<00:03:01.829> Leon

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
so around 1740 another Weaver from Leon

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.119 
so around 1740 another Weaver from Leon
called<00:03:02.400> falco<00:03:03.060> came<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.379> idea<00:03:04.590> he

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
called falco came up with this idea he

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.030 
called falco came up with this idea he
put<00:03:05.370> each<00:03:05.849> pattern<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> separate<00:03:06.930> card<00:03:07.260> now

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
put each pattern on a separate card now

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
put each pattern on a separate card now
the<00:03:08.099> card<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.489> more<00:03:08.640> durable<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.359> you

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the card is more durable and you

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.390 
the card is more durable and you
couldn't<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.379> mistake<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:11.189> should

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
couldn't really mistake how you should

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.479 
couldn't really mistake how you should
position<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:12.049> around<00:03:13.049> 1750<00:03:13.829> one<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.370> the
