mean<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.480> far<00:01:57.690> side<00:01:57.990> hit<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.320> you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
mean that's the far side hit when you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.980 
mean that's the far side hit when you
hit<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.820> buzzer-beater<00:02:00.120> once<00:02:00.480> in<00:02:00.630> high<00:02:00.720> school
