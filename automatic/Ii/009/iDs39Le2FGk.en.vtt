00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.799
 times the camera went as I think 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.909
 can i if i think any 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.909
 I can actually look better 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.100
 So I'm pretty disappointed 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.730

 red-white-red lifestyle to make it 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:16.260
 are training and are already looking forward to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.560
 get involved and patrick and knows too 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.889
 hope is go and then we will find him 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.889
 that determines 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:34.829
 Talk to us disturbing race 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.109
 I make it look like ticks a new one 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:48.440
 system of leisure is indeed the will 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:53.459

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.370
 euro and why Beck we are just around 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.760
 the way for almost an hour for the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.760

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.080
 project 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.600
 We will definitely be me and then 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.090
 do we have to do training research it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.780
 Meanwhile, we actually have today 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.920
 but mostly we are flawed 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.940
 recordings for you also determined 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:48.770
 and I would say we switch again 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:52.990
