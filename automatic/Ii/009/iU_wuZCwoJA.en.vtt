to ground balance and make sure that you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
to ground balance and make sure that you
either<00:00:57.949> keep<00:00:58.949> other<00:00:59.579> metals<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.449> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
either keep other metals out there like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.439 
either keep other metals out there like
the<00:01:01.340> different<00:01:02.340> irons<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the different irons that you want you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
the different irons that you want you
can<00:01:03.570> totally<00:01:03.840> turn<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.170> iron<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> wanted

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can totally turn out iron if you wanted

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
can totally turn out iron if you wanted
to<00:01:06.049> put<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> side<00:01:08.990> first<00:01:09.990> thing<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to put that to the side first thing we

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
to put that to the side first thing we
have<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> packaging<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
have here you can see the packaging is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.840 
have here you can see the packaging is
pretty<00:01:13.580> well<00:01:15.950> well<00:01:16.950> design<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.610> doesn't

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
pretty well well design so it doesn't

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
pretty well well design so it doesn't
rattle<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.270> inside<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.430> first<00:01:20.430> thing

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
rattle around inside there first thing

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
rattle around inside there first thing
we<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.780> extension<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:25.580> set<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
we got here is one extension to set that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
we got here is one extension to set that
aside

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.400 

it's<00:01:35.470> like<00:01:35.680> they<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.160> strap<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:37.090> their<00:01:37.410> so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
it's like they have a strap on their so

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.720 
it's like they have a strap on their so
the<00:01:38.560> coil<00:01:38.770> doesn't<00:01:39.040> rattle<00:01:39.190> around<00:01:39.370> let<00:01:39.670> me

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
the coil doesn't rattle around let me

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.290 
the coil doesn't rattle around let me
just<00:01:39.940> cut<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.330> real<00:01:40.540> quick<00:01:46.620> so<00:01:47.620> there's<00:01:47.800> your

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
just cut that real quick so there's your

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:58.109 
just cut that real quick so there's your
coil<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:51.280> looks<00:01:51.460> like

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.090 

looks<00:01:58.690> pretty<00:01:58.840> nicely<00:01:59.440> they<00:01:59.590> had<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.860> packed

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
looks pretty nicely they had it packed

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.440 
looks pretty nicely they had it packed
in<00:02:00.280> there<00:02:00.430> very<00:02:00.610> well<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.000> went<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.180> rattle

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
in there very well so it went to rattle

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.230 
in there very well so it went to rattle
around<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.560> put<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.860> coil<00:02:03.070> down<00:02:03.250> right<00:02:03.490> here

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.029 

it's<00:02:07.240> pretty<00:02:07.360> excited<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.709> metal

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
it's pretty excited to get this metal

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's pretty excited to get this metal
detector<00:02:16.950> couldn't<00:02:17.950> quite<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.450> box

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
detector couldn't quite see that the box

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.040 
detector couldn't quite see that the box
is<00:02:19.900> empty<00:02:19.959> now<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.580> some<00:02:23.489> some<00:02:24.840> return<00:02:25.840> mail

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
is empty now just some some return mail

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.270 
is empty now just some some return mail
slips<00:02:26.440> there<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.540> down<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
slips there I put this down you have a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.790 
slips there I put this down you have a
whole<00:02:30.459> box<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:36.510> there's<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.780> gold<00:02:38.380> handle

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
whole box here there's the gold handle

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.630 
whole box here there's the gold handle
put<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:39.850> detector<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:42.340> there<00:02:42.550> you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
put this detector on it's on there you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:57.220 
put this detector on it's on there you
got<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> arm<00:02:43.000> band<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.860> go

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.710 

I<00:02:57.550> got<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.640> play<00:02:58.790> with<00:02:58.909> one<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.120> these<00:02:59.300> at<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
I got to play with one of these at the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.100 
I got to play with one of these at the
miners<00:03:00.140> cache<00:03:00.379> here<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.800> reading<00:03:01.720> lots<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.870> fun

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
miners cache here in reading lots of fun

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.990 
miners cache here in reading lots of fun
be<00:03:03.680> sure<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.950> talk<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.280> chip<00:03:04.489> over<00:03:04.730> there<00:03:04.879> if

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
be sure to talk to chip over there if

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.300 
be sure to talk to chip over there if
you<00:03:05.090> want<00:03:05.269> anything<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.159> he<00:03:07.159> is<00:03:07.190> a

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
you want anything like this he is a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.680 
you want anything like this he is a
Fisher<00:03:07.670> dealer<00:03:09.670> see<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:10.760> got<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.940> little

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
Fisher dealer see we got a little

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.580 
Fisher dealer see we got a little
retention<00:03:12.230> nut<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:14.150> gonna<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.500> for<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
retention nut that's gonna be for the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.720 
retention nut that's gonna be for the
coil<00:03:15.980> here<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.430> other<00:03:16.549> side<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.430> then<00:03:19.640> we

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
coil here on the other side and then we

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.270 
coil here on the other side and then we
have<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.000> other<00:03:20.120> extension<00:03:20.629> tube<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.959> here

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
have the other extension tube in here

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.990 
have the other extension tube in here
which<00:03:22.280> actually<00:03:22.760> holds<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> coil<00:03:24.760> as<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.879> can

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
which actually holds the coil as you can

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:40.390 
which actually holds the coil as you can
see<00:03:26.180> here<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.150> see<00:03:38.180> not<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.079> whole<00:03:39.170> lot<00:03:39.560> but
