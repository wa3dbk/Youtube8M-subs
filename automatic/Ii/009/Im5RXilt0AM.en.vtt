we've got a base it's not much more than

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
get into one of these I think the queue

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.410 
get into one of these I think the queue
currently<00:01:05.409> stands<00:01:05.649> about<00:01:06.100> 30<00:01:06.520> people<00:01:06.909> trying

currently stands about 30 people trying
to<00:01:07.479> get<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.899> or<00:01:08.049> something<00:01:08.289> like<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.619> across

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
to get in or something like that across

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.340 
to get in or something like that across
the<00:01:09.039> two<00:01:09.310> servers<00:01:09.819> so<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:10.659> very<00:01:11.110> difficult

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
the two servers so it is very difficult

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.680 
the two servers so it is very difficult
but<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.799> managed<00:01:12.069> to<00:01:12.190> jump<00:01:12.399> in<00:01:12.670> just<00:01:13.360> as<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
but I managed to jump in just as the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.600 
but I managed to jump in just as the
servers<00:01:14.080> went<00:01:14.319> live<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.399> could<00:01:15.459> show

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
servers went live so that I could show

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.249 
servers went live so that I could show
you<00:01:15.789> guys<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.390> people<00:01:16.690> who<00:01:16.810> don't<00:01:17.140> have

see on the original designs that there

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.300 
see on the original designs that there
are<00:02:07.869> going<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.170> some<00:02:08.470> areas<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.039> map

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
are going to be some areas of this map

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.369 
are going to be some areas of this map
that<00:02:09.519> will<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.759> elevated<00:02:10.390> much<00:02:10.690> higher<00:02:11.019> than

that will be elevated much higher than

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.940 
that will be elevated much higher than
where<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.099> vehicles<00:02:12.489> are<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.940> ground<00:02:13.950> but

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
where the vehicles are on the ground but

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.949 
where the vehicles are on the ground but
arguably<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.760> standout<00:02:16.239> feature<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.840> this

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
arguably the standout feature of this

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.300 
arguably the standout feature of this
map<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.440> something<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:17.920> you'll<00:02:18.069> probably

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
map is something that you'll probably

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
map is something that you'll probably
have<00:02:18.519> seen<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> gameplay<00:02:19.569> already<00:02:20.170> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
have seen in the gameplay already the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.830 
have seen in the gameplay already the
waterfall<00:02:21.580> now<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> lot<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> people<00:02:22.480> didn't

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
waterfall now a lot of people didn't

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.229 
waterfall now a lot of people didn't
want<00:02:23.110> dice<00:02:23.560> LA<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.069> take<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.670> waterfall

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
want dice LA to just take the waterfall

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.270 
want dice LA to just take the waterfall
that<00:02:25.750> was<00:02:25.900> currently<00:02:26.290> available<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.830> think<00:02:26.860> on

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that was currently available I think on

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.890 
that was currently available I think on
lost<00:02:27.640> islands<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.300> that's<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.569> fairly

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
lost islands because that's a fairly

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.020 
lost islands because that's a fairly
small<00:02:29.319> one<00:02:29.620> if<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.220> haven't<00:02:30.489> played<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.849> lost

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
small one if you haven't played on lost

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.490 
small one if you haven't played on lost
islands<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.420> wouldn't<00:02:31.659> blame<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.110> naval

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
islands I wouldn't blame you naval

strike<00:02:32.709> DLC<00:02:33.220> wasn't<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> greatest<00:02:34.239> but<00:02:34.840> there

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
strike DLC wasn't the greatest but there

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.350 
strike DLC wasn't the greatest but there
was<00:02:35.200> indeed<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.560> waterfall<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.549> map<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
was indeed a waterfall on that map and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.910 
was indeed a waterfall on that map and
what<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> lot<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.780> people<00:02:37.900> didn't<00:02:38.409> want<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.739> see

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
what a lot of people didn't want to see

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.610 
what a lot of people didn't want to see
was<00:02:39.159> just<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.610> remake<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.810> waterfall<00:02:41.230> in

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
was just a remake of that waterfall in

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.430 
was just a remake of that waterfall in
this<00:02:42.250> jungle<00:02:42.580> map<00:02:42.879> and<00:02:43.150> dice<00:02:43.690> la<00:02:43.989> clearly

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
this jungle map and dice la clearly

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.590 
this jungle map and dice la clearly
listened<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.040> thought<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:45.940> prudent<00:02:46.330> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
listened and thought it was prudent to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.750 
listened and thought it was prudent to
make<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.200> biggest<00:02:47.410> thing<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.340> map<00:02:48.580> I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
make it the biggest thing on the map I

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
make it the biggest thing on the map I
mean<00:02:48.910> right<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.600> as<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.110> said

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
mean right now as I said

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.440 
mean right now as I said
you<00:02:50.680> can't<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.459> huge<00:02:51.790> amount<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.150> what<00:02:52.360> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you can't see a huge amount of what it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.509 
you can't see a huge amount of what it
is<00:02:52.569> going<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.049> look<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.459> a

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
is going to look like but you do get a

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.250 
is going to look like but you do get a
sense<00:02:54.879> of<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.150> scale<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.599> they're<00:02:56.049> going

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
sense of the scale that they're going

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.640 
sense of the scale that they're going
for<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.069> they've<00:02:57.370> gone<00:02:57.519> all<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:58.090> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
for and they've gone all out with it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.800 
for and they've gone all out with it
apart<00:02:59.650> from<00:02:59.829> that<00:02:59.860> there's<00:03:00.459> not<00:03:01.120> much<00:03:01.360> else<00:03:01.629> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
apart from that there's not much else to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.839 
apart from that there's not much else to
really<00:03:02.140> tell<00:03:02.560> from<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:03.129> we<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.519> right<00:03:03.790> now

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
really tell from what we have right now

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.940 
really tell from what we have right now
as<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.150> said<00:03:04.390> at<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.540> start<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.049> video<00:03:05.349> this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
as I said at the start of the video this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.339 
as I said at the start of the video this
is<00:03:06.129> simply<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.730> scale<00:03:07.150> test<00:03:07.540> for<00:03:07.750> dice<00:03:07.959> la<00:03:08.290> to

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
is simply a scale test for dice la to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.039 
is simply a scale test for dice la to
make<00:03:08.680> sure<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.519> they've<00:03:09.700> got<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:10.659> what

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
make sure that they've got right what

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.470 
make sure that they've got right what
they<00:03:11.200> think<00:03:11.439> they've<00:03:11.650> got<00:03:11.680> right<00:03:12.129> so<00:03:12.519> far<00:03:12.849> and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
they think they've got right so far and

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.119 
they think they've got right so far and

comes<00:03:30.159> out<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.489> don't<00:03:30.730> think<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.269> would

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
comes out I don't think that you would

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.140 
comes out I don't think that you would
find<00:03:31.750> many<00:03:32.620> other<00:03:32.889> situations<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.909> many

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
find many other situations with many

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.119 
find many other situations with many
other<00:03:34.359> developers<00:03:34.959> really<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.739> would<00:03:35.859> allow

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
other developers really that would allow

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.879 
other developers really that would allow
you<00:03:36.189> access<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:37.030> map<00:03:37.389> this<00:03:38.019> early<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.769> its

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
you access to a map this early in its

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.819 
you access to a map this early in its
development<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:40.659> kind<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.989> do<00:03:41.139> really<00:03:41.620> want

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
development and I kind of do really want

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.770 
development and I kind of do really want
to<00:03:41.980> emphasize<00:03:42.159> this<00:03:42.790> point<00:03:42.909> because<00:03:43.329> there's

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
to emphasize this point because there's

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.030 
to emphasize this point because there's
a<00:03:43.840> couple<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.200> times<00:03:44.409> where<00:03:44.709> I've<00:03:44.829> made<00:03:45.010> a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
a couple of times where I've made a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160 
a couple of times where I've made a
point<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> video<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:46.030> judging<00:03:46.750> by<00:03:46.900> what

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
point in the video and judging by what

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.780 
point in the video and judging by what
the<00:03:47.290> comments<00:03:47.680> say<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:48.099> maybe<00:03:48.340> people<00:03:48.609> just

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
the comments say that maybe people just

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.270 
the comments say that maybe people just
missed<00:03:49.209> what<00:03:49.389> I<00:03:49.420> said<00:03:49.540> but<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.829> have<00:03:51.099> to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
was the scale of the map and the way

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.099 
was the scale of the map and the way
that<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.799> map<00:04:11.949> sort<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.310> moves<00:04:12.549> right<00:04:13.150> now<00:04:13.419> but

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
that the map sort of moves right now but

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.869

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
about this community map I mean I'll be

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.719 
about this community map I mean I'll be
focusing<00:04:25.419> with<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.199> on<00:04:26.409> my<00:04:26.470> channel<00:04:27.010> quite<00:04:27.699> a

thing to show you guys the development

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.240 
thing to show you guys the development
of<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.870> map<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:32.349> it's<00:04:32.830> not<00:04:32.949> something<00:04:33.220> you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
of a map it's it's not something you

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.300 
of a map it's it's not something you
really<00:04:33.340> get<00:04:33.849> to<00:04:33.880> see<00:04:34.240> but<00:04:35.020> until<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.949> actually

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
really get to see but until I actually

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.370 
really get to see but until I actually
say<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.970> this<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.449> final<00:04:37.780> design<00:04:37.930> or

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
say that this is the final design or

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.230 
say that this is the final design or
someone<00:04:39.099> else<00:04:39.250> says<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.639> is<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> final

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
someone else says this is the final

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.810 
someone else says this is the final

design take everything you see with a

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.210 
design take everything you see with a
pinch<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.240> salt<00:04:43.449> because<00:04:44.010> everything<00:04:45.010> could

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
pinch of salt because everything could

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.790 
pinch of salt because everything could
quite<00:04:45.490> easily<00:04:45.520> change<00:04:46.270> at<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.560> click<00:04:47.770> of

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
quite easily change at the the click of

a button really so yeah take this with a
pinch<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.580> salt<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.349> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
pinch of salt but there you have it the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.060 
pinch of salt but there you have it the
very<00:04:54.070> first<00:04:54.400> look<00:04:54.729> at<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.270> battlefield<00:04:55.810> 4

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
maybe it'll be dominated by one of the

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.659 
maybe it'll be dominated by one of the
things<00:05:06.530> that's<00:05:06.710> on<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:06.949> map<00:05:07.099> who<00:05:07.310> really

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
things that's on the map who really

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.339
