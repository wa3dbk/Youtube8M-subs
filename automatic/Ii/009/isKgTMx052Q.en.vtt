science two bunks because today when

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.990 
science two bunks because today when
we're<00:00:19.590> posting<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.010> video<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> 20th

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
we're posting this video it's the 20th

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.689 
we're posting this video it's the 20th
of<00:00:21.119> july<00:00:21.410> 2009<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> 40th

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
of july 2009 and that's the 40th

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.130 
of july 2009 and that's the 40th
anniversary<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> man<00:00:24.510> landing<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> moon

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
anniversary of man landing on the moon

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.210 
anniversary of man landing on the moon
and<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> thought<00:00:27.900> I'd<00:00:28.170> bunk<00:00:28.619> there's<00:00:29.099> some

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and so I thought I'd bunk there's some

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.259 
and so I thought I'd bunk there's some
people<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.429> there<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.670> claimed<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
people out there that claimed that the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.669 
people out there that claimed that the
the<00:00:30.480> moon<00:00:30.570> landings<00:00:30.929> were<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> hoax<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the moon landings were all a hoax and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.340 
the moon landings were all a hoax and
made<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.160> some<00:00:32.340> film<00:00:32.640> studio<00:00:33.030> somewhere

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
made up in some film studio somewhere

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
made up in some film studio somewhere
which<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> absolute<00:00:34.770> nonsense<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.840> they're

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
which is absolute nonsense and they're

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.830 
which is absolute nonsense and they're
given<00:00:36.930> few<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.300> arguments<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:39.719> give

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
given few sort of arguments or they give

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560 
given few sort of arguments or they give
loads<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:41.370> main<00:00:41.760> ones<00:00:41.969> I've<00:00:42.180> come<00:00:42.480> across

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
loads and the main ones I've come across

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.619 
loads and the main ones I've come across
I<00:00:42.899> thought<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> bank<00:00:43.590> today<00:00:44.329> first<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.510> we

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I thought up the bank today first up we

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
I thought up the bank today first up we
have<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> Van<00:00:45.989> Allen<00:00:46.140> belts<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.280> are

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
have the Van Allen belts now these are

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
have the Van Allen belts now these are
actually<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.899> exist<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.530> where<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
actually they do exist it's where the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
actually they do exist it's where the
energy<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.210> cosmic<00:00:51.510> rays<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.840> silent<00:00:52.230> remark

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
energy the cosmic rays in silent remark

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.540 
energy the cosmic rays in silent remark
to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> atmosphere<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> radiation

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
to the atmosphere and the radiation

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
to the atmosphere and the radiation
there's<00:00:53.940> pretty<00:00:54.180> intense<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.559> people

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
there's pretty intense and the people

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
there's pretty intense and the people
that<00:00:56.160> believe<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> moon<00:00:56.640> landing<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> hoax

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that believe the moon landing was a hoax

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.930 
that believe the moon landing was a hoax
will<00:00:58.260> tell<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.980> passing<00:00:59.670> through<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
will tell you that passing through that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
will tell you that passing through that
you'll<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.180> irradiated<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.780> death<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you'll get irradiated to death and so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.750 
you'll get irradiated to death and so
you<00:01:01.440> couldn't<00:01:01.649> possibly<00:01:01.920> pass<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:02.609> those

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you couldn't possibly pass through those

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.350 
you couldn't possibly pass through those
without<00:01:03.890> dying<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.670> obviously<00:01:06.119> couldn't

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
without dying and so obviously couldn't

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
without dying and so obviously couldn't
have<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> moon<00:01:07.610> well<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> power

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have got to the moon well the power

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
have got to the moon well the power
melts<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.600> exist<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.460> it's<00:01:11.460> true<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
melts do exist and it's true that if you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
melts do exist and it's true that if you
were<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.240> through<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.740> would<00:01:14.159> get

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
were to go through them you would get

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210 
were to go through them you would get
irradiated<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.830> traveling<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
irradiated but if you're traveling in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.320 
irradiated but if you're traveling in
space<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
space you need a little bit of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
space you need a little bit of
protections<00:01:18.810> called<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> spaceship<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
protections called a spaceship and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
protections called a spaceship and
Apollo<00:01:20.640> 11<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> travel<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> moon

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Apollo 11 that travel to the moon

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
Apollo 11 that travel to the moon
offered<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.409> sufficient<00:01:22.860> protection<00:01:23.509> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
offered them sufficient protection to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
offered them sufficient protection to
get<00:01:24.689> through<00:01:25.280> obviously<00:01:26.280> you're<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.430> going

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
get through obviously you're not going

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
get through obviously you're not going
to<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> sort<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> lying<00:01:27.360> naked<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.840> space<00:01:28.170> which

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to be sort of lying naked in space which

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.550 
to be sort of lying naked in space which
would<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:29.570> dangerous<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:31.110> account<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
would be pretty dangerous on account of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
would be pretty dangerous on account of
not<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.250> radiation<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
not just a radiation but you know the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
not just a radiation but you know the
vacuum<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.290> kill<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> before<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
vacuum which would kill you before the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
vacuum which would kill you before the
radiation<00:01:35.460> did<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.930> yes<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.590> Van

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
radiation did and so yes the the Van

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
radiation did and so yes the the Van
Allen<00:01:37.829> belts<00:01:38.420> bail<00:01:39.420> argument<00:01:39.600> Fergus<00:01:40.970> next<00:01:41.970> up

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
Allen belts bail argument Fergus next up

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
Allen belts bail argument Fergus next up
you<00:01:42.240> might<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.540> heard<00:01:42.720> they'll<00:01:43.470> tell<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you might have heard they'll tell you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
you might have heard they'll tell you
that<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> pictures<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.780> fake<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.380> can

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that the pictures will fake and you can

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.620 
that the pictures will fake and you can
tell<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.890> by<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.000> fact<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.540> no

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
tell this by the fact that there are no

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
tell this by the fact that there are no
stars<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> sky<00:01:49.939> reason<00:01:50.939> being<00:01:51.119> obviously

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
stars in the sky reason being obviously

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
stars in the sky reason being obviously
there's<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:51.780> atmosphere<00:01:51.960> no<00:01:52.229> clouds<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
there's no atmosphere no clouds and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
there's no atmosphere no clouds and
everything<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> sky<00:01:54.509> should<00:01:54.630> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
everything and the sky should be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
everything and the sky should be
littered<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.200> stars<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> didn't<00:01:56.250> he

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
littered with stars so what I didn't he

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240 
littered with stars so what I didn't he
appear<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> any<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> photos<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.920> just

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
shows an ignorance of how photography
works<00:02:03.829> number<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.070> firstly<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
works number of things firstly if you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
works number of things firstly if you
look<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.689> photos<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.920> looking

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
look at all of the photos you're looking

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 
look at all of the photos you're looking
at<00:02:08.429> people<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.539> bright<00:02:09.869> white

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619

experienced I hope lovely cloudless
nights<00:02:17.010> where<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.239> basically<00:02:19.040> read<00:02:20.040> with

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
nights where you can basically read with

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.140 
nights where you can basically read with
just<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> light<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.569> moon<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:24.030> know

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
just the light of the moon and you know

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
just the light of the moon and you know
the<00:02:24.269> light<00:02:24.569> was<00:02:24.720> reflected<00:02:25.110> up<00:02:25.170> there's<00:02:25.409> very

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the light was reflected up there's very

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280 
the light was reflected up there's very
bright<00:02:26.360> now<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.510> think<00:02:27.690> about<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.989> if

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
bright now if you think about it if

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.990 
bright now if you think about it if
you're<00:02:28.379> taking<00:02:28.530> photo<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> moon<00:02:29.459> you're

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you're taking photo on the moon you're

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.399 
you're taking photo on the moon you're
going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> need<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:31.110> short

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
going to need to have a very short

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.259 
going to need to have a very short
exposure<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.819> pick<00:02:33.030> anything

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
exposure time so you can pick anything

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.059 
exposure time so you can pick anything
up<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.629> all<00:02:33.780> without<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.200> getting<00:02:34.290> overexposed

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
up at all without it getting overexposed

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.550 
up at all without it getting overexposed
and<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:36.989> they've<00:02:37.140> done<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and this is what they've done and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.589 
and this is what they've done and
understandably<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.849> stars<00:02:39.299> in<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.510> sky

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
understandably that the stars in the sky

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.170 
understandably that the stars in the sky
just<00:02:40.049> don't<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.470> enough<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.579> get

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
just don't have enough time to get

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.449 
just don't have enough time to get
picked<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.750> these<00:02:43.049> these<00:02:43.709> photos<00:02:44.129> which<00:02:44.340> is

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
picked up on these these photos which is

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.309 
picked up on these these photos which is
why<00:02:44.549> they're<00:02:44.730> not<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.870> again<00:02:46.109> if<00:02:46.230> they

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
why they're not there so again if they

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.479 
why they're not there so again if they
tell<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.739> there's<00:02:46.920> no<00:02:47.010> stars<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
tell you that there's no stars in the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.699 
tell you that there's no stars in the
sky<00:02:48.349> direct<00:02:49.349> them<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> photography<00:02:50.040> course

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
sky direct them to a photography course

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.680 
sky direct them to a photography course
what<00:02:52.709> else<00:02:52.739> they<00:02:53.129> claim<00:02:53.370> oh<00:02:53.579> yeah<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.329> example

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
what else they claim oh yeah for example

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.809 
what else they claim oh yeah for example
the<00:02:55.190> they<00:02:56.190> say<00:02:56.340> there<00:02:56.579> should<00:02:56.609> have<00:02:56.730> been

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the they say there should have been

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.220 
the they say there should have been
billowing<00:02:57.720> clouds<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.440> dust<00:02:58.620> from<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.340> lander

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
billowing clouds of dust from the lander

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.589 
billowing clouds of dust from the lander
taking<00:03:01.230> off<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.650> landing<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.640> again<00:03:03.329> there's

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
taking off and landing and again there's

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.119 
taking off and landing and again there's
an<00:03:03.690> important<00:03:04.079> point<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.379> you're<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:04.980> on

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
an important point here you're not on

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.059 
an important point here you're not on
earth<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.260> moon<00:03:07.409> which<00:03:07.680> has<00:03:07.920> no

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
earth you are on the moon which has no

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.339 
earth you are on the moon which has no
atmosphere<00:03:08.989> there's<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.319> called

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
atmosphere there's a thing called

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.530 
atmosphere there's a thing called
Brownian<00:03:11.040> motion<00:03:11.430> which<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.879> basically<00:03:12.239> how

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
Brownian motion which is basically how

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180 
Brownian motion which is basically how
particles<00:03:13.260> get<00:03:13.590> knocked<00:03:13.739> about<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
particles get knocked about in the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.009 
particles get knocked about in the
atmosphere<00:03:14.639> it's<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.239> there's<00:03:15.569> lots<00:03:15.900> of

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
atmosphere it's because there's lots of

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.800 
atmosphere it's because there's lots of
there<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.690> know

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
there and that you can see this you know

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.720 
there and that you can see this you know
get<00:03:19.169> a<00:03:19.200> beam<00:03:19.500> Sun<00:03:19.799> going<00:03:20.010> for<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
get a beam Sun going for you can see the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
get a beam Sun going for you can see the
dust<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:22.380> through<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.680> air<00:03:22.799> getting

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
dust so going through the air getting

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.369 
dust so going through the air getting
too<00:03:23.489> pumped<00:03:24.239> about<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:27.260> don't<00:03:28.260> try

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
too pumped about and so if you don't try

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.080 
too pumped about and so if you don't try
this<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.560> home<00:03:28.680> kids<00:03:28.799> blow<00:03:29.250> up<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.519> bag<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.879> flour

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
this at home kids blow up a bag of flour

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180 
this at home kids blow up a bag of flour
for<00:03:30.419> example<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:30.930> big<00:03:31.109> clouds<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.739> blue

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
for example you get big clouds of blue

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.979 
for example you get big clouds of blue
heron<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.430> 10<00:03:32.579> cages<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.299> too<00:03:33.540> tool

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
heron of 10 cages for a little too tool

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
heron of 10 cages for a little too tool
and<00:03:34.139> then<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.950> don't<00:03:35.129> get<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.609> moon

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and then you don't get this on the moon

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.430 
and then you don't get this on the moon
because<00:03:35.879> there's<00:03:36.180> no<00:03:36.299> atmosphere<00:03:36.480> for<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.319> to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
because there's no atmosphere for it to

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.960 
because there's no atmosphere for it to
do<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.889> just<00:03:37.919> goes<00:03:38.160> up<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.400> then<00:03:38.700> lands

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
do that it just goes up and then lands

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.129 
do that it just goes up and then lands
and<00:03:39.329> actually<00:03:40.049> if<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.230> were<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.500> study<00:03:42.139> the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
and actually if you were to study the

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.979 
and actually if you were to study the
the<00:03:43.739> dust<00:03:43.949> out<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.579> actually<00:03:45.329> evidence<00:03:45.750> that

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the dust out it actually evidence that

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.390 
the dust out it actually evidence that
they<00:03:46.109> did<00:03:46.290> land<00:03:46.530> on<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> moon<00:03:46.889> because<00:03:47.129> it'd

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
they did land on the moon because it'd

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150 
they did land on the moon because it'd
be<00:03:47.569> exceptionally<00:03:48.569> difficult<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:49.230> create<00:03:50.069> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
be exceptionally difficult to create a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.460 
be exceptionally difficult to create a
huge<00:03:50.669> film<00:03:51.060> studio<00:03:51.569> in<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.780> vacuum<00:03:51.959> which

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
huge film studio in a vacuum which

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.009 
huge film studio in a vacuum which
obviously<00:03:52.889> they<00:03:53.220> are<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:54.569> dust<00:03:54.810> for

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
obviously they are because the dust for

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.099 
obviously they are because the dust for
Hayes's<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.500> would<00:03:55.819> on<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:57.510> moon<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:57.930> no

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
Hayes's it would on the moon with no

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.409 
Hayes's it would on the moon with no
atmosphere<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> know<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.299> would

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
atmosphere and you know it would

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.960 
atmosphere and you know it would
actually<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.750> harder<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.530> fake<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.220> than<00:04:02.940> to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
actually be harder to fake that than to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.539 
actually be harder to fake that than to
send<00:04:03.329> somebody<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> moon<00:04:04.169> really

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
send somebody to the moon really

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.300 
send somebody to the moon really
actually<00:04:05.549> cool<00:04:05.970> little<00:04:06.180> fact<00:04:06.859> the<00:04:07.859> best

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
actually cool little fact the best

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.490 
actually cool little fact the best
experimental<00:04:09.239> vacuums<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> have<00:04:10.079> ever<00:04:10.290> been

experimental vacuums that have ever been

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.319 
experimental vacuums that have ever been
created<00:04:11.629> are<00:04:12.629> less<00:04:12.959> good<00:04:13.260> they<00:04:13.650> then<00:04:14.329> space

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
created are less good they then space

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.319

experimental<00:04:24.120> vacuums<00:04:24.479> which<00:04:24.750> i<00:04:24.990> think<00:04:25.050> is

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
experimental vacuums which i think is

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.580 
experimental vacuums which i think is
kind<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.590> cool<00:04:26.630> what<00:04:27.630> else<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:27.960> said<00:04:28.350> oh

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
kind of cool what else have they said oh

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.460 
kind of cool what else have they said oh
yeah<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.580> some<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:29.940> photos<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.600> the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
yeah on some of the photos and the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.629 
yeah on some of the photos and the
shadows<00:04:32.190> seem<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.880> point<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:34.070> not<00:04:35.070> sort<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
shadows seem to point in not sort of

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.640 
shadows seem to point in not sort of
straight<00:04:35.970> lines<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.600> they<00:04:36.750> sort<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.050> diverge

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
straight lines that they sort of diverge

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.830 
straight lines that they sort of diverge
from<00:04:38.120> each<00:04:39.120> other<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:40.520> here's<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.729> picture<00:04:42.690> of

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
from each other and here's a picture of

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.070 
from each other and here's a picture of
that<00:04:43.789> they<00:04:44.789> claim<00:04:45.030> obviously<00:04:45.479> wouldn't<00:04:45.750> have

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
that they claim obviously wouldn't have

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.300 
that they claim obviously wouldn't have
shadows<00:04:46.440> behaving<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:46.860> that<00:04:46.919> if<00:04:47.160> there<00:04:47.280> was

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
shadows behaving like that if there was

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.999 
shadows behaving like that if there was
a<00:04:47.400> single<00:04:47.729> light<00:04:47.880> source<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.740> again<00:04:49.740> this<00:04:49.860> is

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
a single light source and again this is

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.040 
a single light source and again this is
incorrect<00:04:50.449> firstly<00:04:51.449> if<00:04:51.509> you<00:04:51.570> had<00:04:51.690> multiple

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
incorrect firstly if you had multiple

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.750 
incorrect firstly if you had multiple
light<00:04:52.169> sources<00:04:52.199> you'd<00:04:52.949> expect<00:04:53.280> more<00:04:53.460> than<00:04:53.639> one

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
light sources you'd expect more than one

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.480 
light sources you'd expect more than one
shadow<00:04:54.169> which<00:04:55.169> isn't<00:04:55.560> there<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.340> can

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
shadow which isn't there and you can

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.070 
shadow which isn't there and you can
also<00:04:56.610> see<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:57.060> effect<00:04:57.330> actually<00:04:57.539> on<00:04:57.900> earth

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
also see this effect actually on earth

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.950 
also see this effect actually on earth
if<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.800> go<00:04:58.949> on<00:04:59.520> my<00:04:59.699> sunny<00:04:59.970> day<00:05:00.210> on<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.930> very

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
if you go on my sunny day on to a very

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.840 
if you go on my sunny day on to a very
tall<00:05:01.320> building<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.280> can<00:05:02.340> see<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.580> whilst

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
tall building you can see that whilst

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.550 
tall building you can see that whilst
there's<00:05:03.030> only<00:05:03.150> one<00:05:03.330> point<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.690> light<00:05:03.930> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
there's only one point of light the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.070 
there's only one point of light the
shadows<00:05:04.800> aren't<00:05:05.220> exactly<00:05:06.090> parallel<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:06.780> do

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
shadows aren't exactly parallel they do

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.779 
shadows aren't exactly parallel they do
seem<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:08.449> you<00:05:09.449> know<00:05:09.570> go<00:05:10.350> out<00:05:10.380> as<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:11.580> this

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
seem to you know go out as in this

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.140 
seem to you know go out as in this
picture<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.270> moon<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:12.630> we<00:05:13.080> have<00:05:13.229> up<00:05:13.380> and

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
picture of the moon that we have up and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.159 
picture of the moon that we have up and
so<00:05:15.150> again<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.599> that<00:05:15.750> just<00:05:15.990> shows<00:05:16.139> that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
so again that that just shows that

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.499 
so again that that just shows that
that's<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:17.190> silly<00:05:17.490> argument<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:18.150> based<00:05:18.300> on

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
that's a silly argument is based on

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.740 
that's a silly argument is based on
ignorance<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:20.000> also<00:05:21.000> an<00:05:21.060> important<00:05:21.479> points

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
ignorance and also an important points

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.960 
ignorance and also an important points
here<00:05:21.930> some<00:05:22.680> people<00:05:23.009> confuse<00:05:23.340> ignorance<00:05:23.820> and

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
here some people confuse ignorance and

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.610 
here some people confuse ignorance and
stupidity<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.810> not<00:05:25.020> doing<00:05:25.139> these<00:05:25.289> people

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
stupidity and not doing these people

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.620 
stupidity and not doing these people
stupid<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.250> corny<00:05:26.400> man<00:05:26.610> ignorant<00:05:26.970> they<00:05:27.419> just

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
stupid and corny man ignorant they just

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.080 
stupid and corny man ignorant they just
don't<00:05:27.780> necessarily<00:05:27.870> know<00:05:28.440> things<00:05:29.090> obviously

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
don't necessarily know things obviously

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.219 
don't necessarily know things obviously
if<00:05:30.180> they've<00:05:30.300> watched<00:05:30.510> this<00:05:30.690> video<00:05:30.870> remember

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
if they've watched this video remember

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.230 
if they've watched this video remember
to<00:05:31.440> follow<00:05:31.710> things<00:05:32.039> up<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.669> still<00:05:32.940> think<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
to follow things up and still think the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.420 
to follow things up and still think the
moon<00:05:33.360> landing<00:05:33.660> was<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.780> hoax<00:05:34.160> then<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.190> may<00:05:35.370> be

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
moon landing was a hoax then I may be

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.000 
moon landing was a hoax then I may be
less<00:05:35.669> generous<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:37.400> Joaquin<00:05:38.400> d<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:40.440> those<00:05:40.979> are

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
less generous and Joaquin d so those are

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.879 
less generous and Joaquin d so those are
just<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.430> ideas<00:05:42.030> off<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.150> top<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.419> my<00:05:42.570> head

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
just the ideas off the top of my head

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.629 
just the ideas off the top of my head
but<00:05:44.060> basically<00:05:45.060> I'm<00:05:45.479> reflecting<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:47.520> bad

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
but basically I'm reflecting to the bad

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.980 
but basically I'm reflecting to the bad
astronomer<00:05:48.919> website<00:05:49.919> he's<00:05:50.190> got<00:05:50.400> loads<00:05:50.849> of<00:05:51.060> the
