00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.929 
playing in a hurt center that was a
great<00:02:01.920> experience<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.490> didn't<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> chance

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
great experience I didn't get a chance

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.539 
great experience I didn't get a chance
to<00:02:03.060> play<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.329> Mizzou<00:02:03.540> Arena<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
to play in Mizzou Arena but the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.449 
to play in Mizzou Arena but the
atmosphere<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> fans<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.280> really<00:02:08.280> had<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
atmosphere there the fans I really had a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.199 
atmosphere there the fans I really had a
good<00:02:08.700> group<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> guys<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.239> were<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.690> me

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
good group of guys that were with me

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.229 
good group of guys that were with me
and<00:02:10.299> I<00:02:11.140> guess<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.220> liate<00:02:12.579> run<00:02:13.030> that's

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
and I guess the the liate run that's

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.020 
and I guess the the liate run that's
what<00:02:14.049> most<00:02:14.230> people<00:02:14.530> bring<00:02:14.739> up<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.310> think

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
what most people bring up and I think

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.270 
what most people bring up and I think
that's<00:02:16.209> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.599> where<00:02:16.829> you<00:02:17.829> know<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.099> play
