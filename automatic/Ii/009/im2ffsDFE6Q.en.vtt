00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
what made you decide to use that camera

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.530 
what made you decide to use that camera
it<00:00:13.679> was<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.040> small<00:00:14.280> platform<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
it was the small platform and it was the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.029 
it was the small platform and it was the
ability<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.049> multiple<00:00:16.170> cameras<00:00:16.920> that

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
ability to have multiple cameras that

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.790 
ability to have multiple cameras that
are<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.250> low<00:00:17.369> cost<00:00:17.640> via<00:00:18.619> shows<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
are really low cost via shows like a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.859 
are really low cost via shows like a
comedy<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.180> knew<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.420> was<00:00:21.510> gonna<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:21.840> like

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
comedy so I knew it was gonna be like

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410 
comedy so I knew it was gonna be like
improv<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.890> knew<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> couldn't<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> lot<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
improv and I knew I couldn't do a lot of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.759 
improv and I knew I couldn't do a lot of
take<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> need<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
take so I was going to need a lot of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
take so I was going to need a lot of
coverage<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.330> perfect<00:00:27.570> for

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
coverage and it was just perfect for

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
coverage and it was just perfect for
what<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.439> were<00:00:28.500> doing<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.859> well<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.760> had<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
what we were doing as well as we had a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
what we were doing as well as we had a
whole<00:00:30.090> night<00:00:30.359> scene<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.859> everybody

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
whole night scene and you know everybody

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
whole night scene and you know everybody
knows<00:00:32.309> 5d<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:32.940> lowlights<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
knows 5d and lowlights the way to go and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.560 
knows 5d and lowlights the way to go and
was<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> budget<00:00:35.489> part<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> reason<00:00:36.300> why<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
was the budget part of the reason why I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
was the budget part of the reason why I
use<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.809> camera<00:00:37.170> oh<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.710> budget<00:00:38.010> was

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
use that camera oh the budget was

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100 
use that camera oh the budget was
totally<00:00:38.730> part<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> reason<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.690> we

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
totally part of the reason i think we

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.479 
totally part of the reason i think we
probably<00:00:40.620> spent<00:00:41.750> 5<00:00:42.750> grand<00:00:42.780> total<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> three

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
probably spent 5 grand total and three

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.549 
probably spent 5 grand total and three
