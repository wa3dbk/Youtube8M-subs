description<00:01:51.869> below<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.740> tell<00:01:52.920> people<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> use

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
description below and tell people to use

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.940 
description below and tell people to use
it<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> probably<00:01:54.030> won't<00:01:54.360> work<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it it probably won't work but that's a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.520 
it it probably won't work but that's a
way<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.369> people<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.880> use<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:57.990> code<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
way to get people to use your code and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
way to get people to use your code and
it<00:01:58.649> gives<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> hundred<00:01:59.670> or<00:01:59.880> fifty<00:02:00.570> mod

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it gives you like a hundred or fifty mod

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
it gives you like a hundred or fifty mod
points<00:02:01.430> every<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.460> someone<00:02:02.969> enters<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.390> in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
points every time someone enters it in

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
points every time someone enters it in
but<00:02:03.689> i<00:02:03.750> actually<00:02:04.229> never<00:02:04.530> found<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.189> how<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but i actually never found out how to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
but i actually never found out how to
enter<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> code<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.740> weird<00:02:09.410> but

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
enter in the code just kind of weird but

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
enter in the code just kind of weird but
yeah<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.700> figure<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:11.940> how<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
yeah so if you can figure out how to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.410 
yeah so if you can figure out how to
enter<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.569> someone<00:02:12.870> else's

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
enter in someone else's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.410 
enter in someone else's
would<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.750> get<00:02:14.020> three<00:02:14.890> points<00:02:15.130> for<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:16.240> you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
would you get three points for it if you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.449 
would you get three points for it if you
enter<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.720> someone's<00:02:17.140> code<00:02:17.920> i<00:02:18.130> think<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.400> have

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
enter in someone's code i think you have

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.610 
enter in someone's code i think you have
50<00:02:18.790> points<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.510> start<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.020> with<00:02:20.170> 50

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
50 points and they start you out with 50

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
50 points and they start you out with 50
points<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.880> should<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.239> able<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.630> get<00:02:22.720> this

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
points so you should be able to get this

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.050 
points so you should be able to get this
for<00:02:23.260> free<00:02:23.290> without<00:02:23.620> paying<00:02:24.130> might<00:02:24.819> take<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
little work though but it's worth it for

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.699 
little work though but it's worth it for
