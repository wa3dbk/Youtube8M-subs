00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
what's really cool is it was really

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.710 
what's really cool is it was really
frustrating<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.400> get<00:03:53.579> your<00:03:53.730> mind<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.420> was<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
frustrating to get your mind it was the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.199 
frustrating to get your mind it was the
thing<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.530> sucks<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:56.040> with<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:56.970> world

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
thing that sucks it with with my world

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.940 
thing that sucks it with with my world
of<00:03:57.360> my<00:03:57.480> colony<00:03:57.930> when<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.110> first<00:03:58.350> started<00:03:58.590> out<00:03:58.709> is

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
of my colony when I first started out is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.440 
of my colony when I first started out is
flattening<00:03:59.519> everything<00:03:59.970> out<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.329> getting

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
flattening everything out and getting

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.110 
flattening everything out and getting
the<00:04:00.630> land<00:04:00.840> how<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.019> wanted<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.500> for<00:04:01.739> my<00:04:01.890> city<00:04:02.220> but

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
the land how I wanted it for my city but

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.180 
the land how I wanted it for my city but
this<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.600> amazing<00:04:04.019> because<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.860> don't<00:04:05.040> have

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
this is amazing because you don't have

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.289 
this is amazing because you don't have
to<00:04:05.340> worry<00:04:05.489> about<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:05.940> already<00:04:06.060> have

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
to worry about that you already have

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.060 
to worry about that you already have
this<00:04:06.450> great<00:04:06.720> place<00:04:06.989> set<00:04:07.230> up<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.769> doesn't

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
this great place set up and it doesn't

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.590 
this great place set up and it doesn't
look<00:04:08.190> weird<00:04:08.519> when<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.060> your<00:04:09.209> when<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
look weird when you have your when you

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.949 
look weird when you have your when you
have<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.459> cut<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.609> land<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.269> yourself<00:04:12.780> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
have to cut the the land on yourself and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.330 
have to cut the the land on yourself and
make<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.200> look<00:04:13.350> all<00:04:13.500> just<00:04:13.709> just<00:04:13.920> not<00:04:14.070> natural

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
make it look all just just not natural

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.890 
make it look all just just not natural
so<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.820> place<00:04:14.970> looks<00:04:15.150> really<00:04:15.450> natural<00:04:15.630> how

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
so this place looks really natural how

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.409 
so this place looks really natural how
it's<00:04:16.049> not<00:04:16.200> fully<00:04:16.530> flat<00:04:16.829> but<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.519> kind<00:04:18.090> of<00:04:18.209> is

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
it's not fully flat but it kind of is

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.270 
it's not fully flat but it kind of is
like<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.739> know<00:04:19.769> there's<00:04:20.039> still<00:04:20.220> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
like like you know there's still a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.219 
like like you know there's still a
couple<00:04:20.729> levels<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.450> still<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.140> you

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
couple levels is still there and as you

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.690 
couple levels is still there and as you
can<00:04:22.320> tell<00:04:22.380> there's<00:04:22.830> isn't<00:04:23.010> any<00:04:23.190> loot<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
can tell there's isn't any loot in the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.219 
can tell there's isn't any loot in the
chest<00:04:23.970> but<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.330> keep<00:04:24.599> killing<00:04:24.840> them<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.140> get

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
chest but you keep killing them and get

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.300 
chest but you keep killing them and get
a<00:04:25.260> bunch<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.530> loot<00:04:25.740> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
a bunch of loot so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.129 
a bunch of loot so
I<00:04:26.370> suggest<00:04:27.000> not<00:04:27.120> even<00:04:27.360> killing<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.810> spawner

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
I suggest not even killing the spawner

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.870 
I suggest not even killing the spawner
and<00:04:28.410> just<00:04:28.560> kind<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.830> containing<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.610> almost

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and just kind of containing it almost

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.400 
and just kind of containing it almost
and<00:04:30.150> having<00:04:30.389> them<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.660> spawn<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.110> there<00:04:31.230> like

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and having them all spawn in there like

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.490 
and having them all spawn in there like
blocking<00:04:31.740> off<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.889> door<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:33.870> otherwise<00:04:34.050> it's

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
blocking off the door but otherwise it's

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.200 
blocking off the door but otherwise it's
a<00:04:34.590> really<00:04:34.919> great<00:04:35.160> addition<00:04:35.400> they<00:04:35.730> sound

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
a really great addition they sound

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.180 
a really great addition they sound
amazing<00:04:36.419> when<00:04:37.110> they<00:04:37.200> die<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.800> when<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.040> hit

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
amazing when they die and when you hit

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.240 
amazing when they die and when you hit
them<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.520> we<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:38.850> are<00:04:39.320> around<00:04:40.320> them<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.220> I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
them and we just are around them so I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.590 
them and we just are around them so I
don't<00:04:41.669> really<00:04:41.760> think<00:04:41.880> these<00:04:42.120> guys<00:04:42.330> will<00:04:42.510> ever

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
don't really think these guys will ever

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.110 
don't really think these guys will ever
