00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
there's something really cool that I

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.280 
there's something really cool that I
noticed<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> come<00:01:16.080> over<00:01:16.200> here

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
noticed about this if you come over here

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
noticed about this if you come over here
you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.650> still<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> earth<00:01:17.280> explode<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you can still see the earth explode and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260 
you can still see the earth explode and
that's<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.960> Treyarch<00:01:19.680> being<00:01:20.549> lazy<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> not

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's just Treyarch being lazy and not

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's just Treyarch being lazy and not
removing<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> earth<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.290> area<00:01:22.500> 51<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
my buddy he decided to hack it again and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
my buddy he decided to hack it again and
I<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.119> stuck<00:01:42.420> outside<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.740> he
