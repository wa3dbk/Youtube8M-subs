I mean he's got he's built it so that

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.320 
I mean he's got he's built it so that
he's<00:05:54.090> behind<00:05:54.450> a<00:05:54.660> shield<00:05:54.930> yet<00:05:55.970> periodically<00:05:56.970> a

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
he's behind a shield yet periodically a

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.720 
he's behind a shield yet periodically a
button<00:05:58.080> will<00:05:58.170> come<00:05:58.380> down<00:05:58.650> so<00:05:59.010> that<00:05:59.190> power<00:05:59.460> is

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
button will come down so that power is

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.420 
button will come down so that power is
drawn<00:06:00.030> away<00:06:00.060> from<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.630> shield<00:06:01.070> why<00:06:02.070> would<00:06:02.280> he

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
drawn away from the shield why would he

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.140 
drawn away from the shield why would he
do<00:06:02.640> that

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
do that

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.660 
do that
surely<00:06:03.840> be<00:06:03.990> more<00:06:04.170> advantageous<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:05.340> just

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
surely be more advantageous to just

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.870
