00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.860
 Today it is about the protein recovery 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.010
 That's why we make a protein chocolate 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.010
 cake 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:34.540
 For this we need protein sugar and tea 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:41.460
 or chocolate-mail cinnamon almonds or 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.460
 sprinkle nuts rom and powdered sugar 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.040
 first, a box shape with 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.410
 Sandwich paper designed the edge 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.790
 lightly grease just so that the paper 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:16.980
 sticking remains trimmed up 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:22.020
 the side panels only determine the whole page 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.760
 easy digging on trenches does not have to hold much 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.270
 only so that the dough be filled 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.270
 can 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:40.290
 and then the butter is with some 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 sugar and the cinnamon small belongs to the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:53.580
 you can continue to butter some rest 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:57.360
 if it works so then who wants good shot 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.050
 It does not have to be that way 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050
 be aroma 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.709
 then comes the dissolved in a water bath 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.630
 Let's say something warm and warm now 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.810
 then it's good if the butter is something 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.810
 is adjusted correctly with their 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.349
 then you can see the air inclusions 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.420
 beaten white 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.930
 a giant salt is about sugar 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.000
 a third from the right and it knows 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:47.360
 could that strike the right one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.360
 slay 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.800
 now the second third can do this 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.150
 be given back slowly under 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.019
 stir sugar again then about 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.660
 fully turn down five minutes 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:14.610
 Finally, its the right one 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.500
 sugar and again a few minutes 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.800
 beat up the sugar full 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.820
 dissolved and the protein in silky 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:31.580
 gloss has determined to be correct 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:35.420
 turn down so that has very good 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.420
 so I just right 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.989
 and here comes something protein and will 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 like butter that settles when she does 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:53.940
 further is slightly better down to 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.870
 yesterday with their beat previous net 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.750
 definitely do not hit 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.170
 otherwise the whole air comes out white that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.170
 not me 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:17.579
 it was a bit too firm or protein 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:25.229
 and then this mass comes under 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:28.410
 the legal protein is possible 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.280
 cook spoon with hole then it's easy 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.280
 mix better 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:44.970
 because you can see it really funny and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.970
 That would be something underneath 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:52.509
 easy mission 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:58.270
 how to hit or hit always from 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:02.910
 bottom up and then the sieved 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:09.280
 flour with the nuts or almonds over it 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:12.759
 and carefully with her and hers 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.380
 like saying how to beat or stir 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:23.440
 the whisk is a deadly sin beautiful 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:32.229
 easy to really stretch that easily 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:38.159
 mass from inside to outside sonhnes finished 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.159
 the manager and protein next something 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:50.650
 Continue to pass and then comes 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:55.449
 whole mass in the cost sequences too 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:58.770
 careful not to knock it again 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.930
 is simply spread with the ground 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:08.340
 Smooth evenly and smoothly 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.340
 dina springer from time to time the same 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:19.950
 in the oven 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:22.520
 at 180 degrees for about 45 to 60 minutes each 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.410
 bake after oven 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.410
 Allow to cool briefly after baking 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.880
 to fall on the grid 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.070
 carefully remove paper from it 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:52.770
 sticking 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:57.470
 this is easy and easy now 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.470
 let the cake cool down 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:07.890
 again short lecture took hold only 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:12.930
 properly or sugar pollinate and ready 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:16.280
 the protein recovery is successful 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.280
 have fun
