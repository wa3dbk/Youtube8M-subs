comes with a chuck timer a corner every
time<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> pressed<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.320> start

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
time you pressed about it it will start

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
time you pressed about it it will start
to<00:00:31.740> count<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.130> okay<00:00:32.610> um<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.719> that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
to count up okay um so you get that

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.860 
to count up okay um so you get that
feature<00:00:34.309> it<00:00:35.309> also<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.870> programmable

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
feature it also has programmable

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
feature it also has programmable
pre-infusion<00:00:37.800> mm-hmm<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.480> program

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
pre-infusion mm-hmm so you can program

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
pre-infusion mm-hmm so you can program
the<00:00:40.410> amount<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> pre-infusion<00:00:41.489> time<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the amount of pre-infusion time a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.959 
the amount of pre-infusion time a
waiting<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.950> total<00:00:44.370> brew<00:00:44.520> time<00:00:44.760> very

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
waiting time and a total brew time very

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.490 
waiting time and a total brew time very
similar<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.390> commercial<00:00:45.539> machines<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.350> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
similar to commercial machines that have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.209 
similar to commercial machines that have
electronic<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> pretty<00:00:47.370> infusion<00:00:47.789> okay

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
electronic and pretty infusion okay

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
electronic and pretty infusion okay
let's<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.180> has<00:00:51.390> three<00:00:51.629> menu<00:00:51.989> selections

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
let's see it has three menu selections

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
let's see it has three menu selections
and<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.160> now<00:00:53.309> they're<00:00:53.520> called<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.420> single

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and right now they're called a single

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.490 
and right now they're called a single
espresso<00:00:55.530> double<00:00:56.129> espresso<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.910> pod<00:00:57.600> okay

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
espresso double espresso and pod okay

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
espresso double espresso and pod okay
doesn't<00:00:59.100> mean<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> pot<00:01:00.030> it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
doesn't mean you have to use a pot it's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.770 
doesn't mean you have to use a pot it's
just<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.780> name<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.440> gave<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.910> four<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just a name we gave it four one two and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
just a name we gave it four one two and
three<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.769> three<00:01:05.040> menu<00:01:05.280> selections<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
three I say three menu selections and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.429 
three I say three menu selections and
you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.570> program<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.290> whatever

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you can just program them for whatever

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:07.910 
you can just program them for whatever
you'd<00:01:07.710> like

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you'd like

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
you'd like
right<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.460> each<00:01:09.119> menu<00:01:09.510> selection<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
right so each menu selection can be

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.760 
right so each menu selection can be
programmed<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.670> temperature<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
programmed for a temperature a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
programmed for a temperature a
pre-infusion<00:01:13.770> time<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.970> total<00:01:15.330> brew<00:01:15.509> time

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pre-infusion time and a total brew time

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
pre-infusion time and a total brew time
okay<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> gives<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.610> option

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
okay so it kind of gives you that option

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.359 
okay so it kind of gives you that option
of<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.540> three<00:01:18.900> different<00:01:19.049> programs<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of doing three different programs for

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
of doing three different programs for
whatever<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> espresso<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
whatever kind of espresso you do in the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
whatever kind of espresso you do in the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
up when it's flashing you can change it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.660 
up when it's flashing you can change it
okay<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.149> let<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> flash<00:01:57.719> three<00:01:58.110> times

okay and if you let it flash three times

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
okay and if you let it flash three times
that<00:01:59.670> new<00:01:59.850> temperature<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.420> set<00:02:00.630> oh<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:01.290> right

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to get to the next one which is

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.749 
to get to the next one which is
pre-infusion<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.439> let's<00:02:07.950> say<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.369> set<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
pre-infusion time let's say we set that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.520 
pre-infusion time let's say we set that
to<00:02:09.119> seconds<00:02:09.899> mm-hmm

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to seconds mm-hmm

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.740 
to seconds mm-hmm
wait<00:02:11.280> let<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.580> flash<00:02:11.760> three<00:02:12.060> times

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
wait let it flash three times

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.240 
wait let it flash three times
and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> waiting<00:02:13.950> time<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.550> three<00:02:14.880> seconds

and then a waiting time of three seconds

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460 
and then a waiting time of three seconds
and<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.460> after<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.210> pre-infusion<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and that's after the pre-infusion and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.500 
and that's after the pre-infusion and
before<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.070> it'll<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.400> pre-infusion<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:21.330> two

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
before so it'll do pre-infusion for two

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.670 
before so it'll do pre-infusion for two
then<00:02:21.900> wait<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:23.510> oops<00:02:24.510> wait<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.410> three

just press menu again and then we're

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.310 
just press menu again and then we're
back<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.500> okay<00:02:53.460> at<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.120> brew<00:02:54.390> time<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.110> we

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
back at okay at the brew time so like we

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900 
back at okay at the brew time so like we
put<00:02:55.710> those<00:02:55.860> settings<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.310> won't<00:02:56.550> run<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> for

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
put those settings I won't run it for

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.160 
put those settings I won't run it for
the<00:02:56.970> whole<00:02:57.120> time<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.450> waste<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> water<00:02:57.930> but

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
the whole time to waste the water but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.890 
the whole time to waste the water but
you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.070> we'll<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> there<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:00.480> two

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you can see we'll do it there we go two

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.950 
you can see we'll do it there we go two
seconds<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:01.770> it'll<00:03:02.070> stop<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.840> do<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
seconds then it'll stop and do the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.360 
seconds then it'll stop and do the
waiting<00:03:04.260> time<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.500> two<00:03:04.860> seconds<00:03:05.310> then

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
waiting time for two seconds then

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.910 
waiting time for two seconds then
continue<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.360> brach<00:03:06.570> got<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.140> okay<00:03:07.500> what

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
continue on the brach got it okay what

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.560 
continue on the brach got it okay what
about<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.220> steaming<00:03:08.490> function<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
about the steaming function so the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.530 
about the steaming function so the
steaming<00:03:09.840> function<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:11.160> separate<00:03:11.640> from<00:03:11.940> it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
steaming function it's separate from it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.510 
steaming function it's separate from it
is<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> thermal<00:03:13.230> block<00:03:13.440> okay<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.370> pretty

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
is a thermal block okay but it's pretty

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.699 
is a thermal block okay but it's pretty
good<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.780> it's<00:03:15.930> separate<00:03:16.230> from<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.530> brew

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
good one and it's separate from the brew

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.640 
good one and it's separate from the brew
boiler<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.270> way<00:03:18.450> we<00:03:18.630> kind<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.110> conserved

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
boiler and the way we kind of conserved

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560 
boiler and the way we kind of conserved
energy<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.430> ran<00:03:20.610> water<00:03:20.910> through<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.420> blue

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
energy was we ran water through the blue

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.690 
energy was we ran water through the blue
brew<00:03:21.959> boiler<00:03:22.170> into<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> thermal<00:03:23.190> block<00:03:23.520> so

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
brew boiler into the thermal block so

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.920 
brew boiler into the thermal block so
it's<00:03:23.820> already<00:03:23.970> heated<00:03:24.270> up<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.420> 200<00:03:24.900> degrees

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it's already heated up to 200 degrees

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.320 
it's already heated up to 200 degrees
okay<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.880> function<00:03:27.300> you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
okay and to get to that function you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.010 
okay and to get to that function you
rotate<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> menu<00:03:28.290> item<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:29.209> steam<00:03:30.209> mm-hmm<00:03:30.930> and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
rotate the menu item to steam mm-hmm and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.870 
rotate the menu item to steam mm-hmm and
you'll<00:03:31.590> hit<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.010> button<00:03:32.250> too<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.520> like<00:03:32.670> that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you'll hit the button too so like that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.040 
you'll hit the button too so like that
and<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:33.209> it'll<00:03:33.360> go<00:03:33.510> through<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.840> heating

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
and then it'll go through the heating

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.770 
and then it'll go through the heating
process<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> heat<00:03:34.860> up<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.160> steam<00:03:35.760> block<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
process to heat up the steam block so

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.420 
process to heat up the steam block so
since<00:03:37.200> they're<00:03:37.350> kind<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.650> integrated<00:03:38.220> you

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
since they're kind of integrated you

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.760 
since they're kind of integrated you
can't<00:03:38.730> use<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.440> simultaneously<00:03:40.440> you're

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
can't use these simultaneously you're

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.259 
can't use these simultaneously you're
gonna<00:03:41.130> be<00:03:41.310> switching<00:03:41.519> between<00:03:41.820> these<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
gonna be switching between these you

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.449 
gonna be switching between these you
have<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> switch<00:03:42.900> between<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.440> two<00:03:43.470> okay<00:03:44.250> so

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
have to switch between the two okay so

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.840 
have to switch between the two okay so
it's<00:03:44.670> either<00:03:45.200> brewing<00:03:46.200> espresso<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:46.850> steaming

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
it's either brewing espresso or steaming

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.979 
it's either brewing espresso or steaming
okay<00:03:48.239> alright<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.690> as

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
ready light okay take a little bit of

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.930 
ready light okay take a little bit of
time<00:04:00.300> since<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.840> 193<00:04:01.680> degrees<00:04:01.980> yeah

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
time since this is 193 degrees yeah

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.790 
time since this is 193 degrees yeah
normally<00:04:03.209> at<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.570> upper<00:04:03.810> 200<00:04:04.260> but<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.380> ran<00:04:04.620> so

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
normally at the upper 200 but I ran so

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.600 
normally at the upper 200 but I ran so
much<00:04:05.480> exactly<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.170> oh<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:11.250> three<00:04:11.489> way

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
much exactly and so oh the three way

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.520 
much exactly and so oh the three way
solenoid<00:04:11.850> valve<00:04:12.420> you've<00:04:12.720> got<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:15.530> release

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
solenoid valve you've got the release

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.590 
solenoid valve you've got the release
down<00:04:16.919> there<00:04:17.220> yes<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.760> that's<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.150> regular

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
down there yes so that's a regular

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.449 
down there yes so that's a regular
three-way<00:04:19.019> valve<00:04:19.049> for<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:20.040> release<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
three-way valve for to release the

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.070 
three-way valve for to release the
pressure<00:04:20.609> off<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> Porta<00:04:21.299> filter<00:04:21.330> mm-hmm<00:04:22.049> and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
pressure off the Porta filter mm-hmm and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.929 
pressure off the Porta filter mm-hmm and
we<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.889> wanted<00:04:24.189> to<00:04:24.280> have<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.610> water

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:24.939 
we really wanted to have this water

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.790 
we really wanted to have this water

was that the relief valve now comes
through<00:04:46.060> this<00:04:46.180> little<00:04:46.389> tube<00:04:46.629> that<00:04:46.689> comes<00:04:47.080> down

through this little tube that comes down

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.110 
through this little tube that comes down
into<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> drain<00:04:47.860> tray<00:04:48.129> okay<00:04:48.580> it's<00:04:48.849> a<00:04:48.909> little

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
going you know it's definitely got a lot

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.980 
going you know it's definitely got a lot
of<00:05:18.909> juice<00:05:19.449> to<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:20.169> actually<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.500> will<00:05:21.990> at

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
of juice to it and actually it will at

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.510 
of juice to it and actually it will at
first<00:05:23.050> if<00:05:23.529> you<00:05:23.650> bleed<00:05:23.860> all<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.099> water<00:05:24.310> out

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
first if you bleed all the water out

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.469 
first if you bleed all the water out
there's<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:24.759> little<00:05:24.879> bit<00:05:25.029> of<00:05:25.060> water<00:05:25.270> in<00:05:25.419> that

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
there's a little bit of water in that

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.909 
there's a little bit of water in that
steam<00:05:25.810> block<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:26.199> when<00:05:26.349> that<00:05:26.439> comes<00:05:26.740> out

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
steam block so when that comes out

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.040 
steam block so when that comes out
you'll<00:05:27.430> see<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.759> this<00:05:27.940> as<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.449> increases<00:05:28.960> it

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
you'll see is this as it increases it

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.269 
you'll see is this as it increases it
actually<00:05:29.349> gets<00:05:29.500> dry<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:29.740> drier<00:05:30.069> and<00:05:30.219> drier

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:30.279 
actually gets dry and drier and drier

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.189 
actually gets dry and drier and drier
and<00:05:30.819> more<00:05:31.210> powerful<00:05:31.719> so<00:05:31.900> okay

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.309 

what<00:05:35.830> kind<00:05:36.009> of<00:05:36.069> portafilter<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.819> that<00:05:37.029> this<00:05:37.960> is

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
what kind of portafilter is that this is

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:44.249 
what kind of portafilter is that this is
a<00:05:40.499> regular<00:05:42.180> commercial<00:05:43.180> size<00:05:43.360> 58<00:05:43.870> millimeter
