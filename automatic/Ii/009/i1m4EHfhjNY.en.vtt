tape<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.410> created

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
tape that was on here and I've created

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.390 
tape that was on here and I've created
edge<00:00:23.220> lines<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> way<00:00:24.750> around<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
edge lines all the way around here and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
edge lines all the way around here and
also<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.900> instead<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.080> scoring<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.900> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
also I instead of scoring all the the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
also I instead of scoring all the the
tape<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.130> should<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.460> done<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.850> my

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
tape like I should have done with my

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.889 
tape like I should have done with my
with<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:33.960> knife<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:35.300> pulled<00:00:36.300> off<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> little

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
with my knife here I pulled off a little

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
with my knife here I pulled off a little
bit<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> paint<00:00:37.620> down<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> what

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bit of the paint down in here so what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
bit of the paint down in here so what
I'm<00:00:40.079> doing<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:41.219> using<00:00:41.460> my

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I'm doing right now is I'm using my

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
I'm doing right now is I'm using my
dupli-color<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.540> top<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> year<00:00:43.260> thing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
dupli-color on top of the year thing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990 
dupli-color on top of the year thing
which<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> absolutely<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> wrong<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
which is absolutely the wrong thing to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
which is absolutely the wrong thing to
do<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:45.920> experimenting<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.070> these

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
do but I'm experimenting with these

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.720 
do but I'm experimenting with these
little<00:00:47.489> parts<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> six

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
little parts because it's not a six

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
little parts because it's not a six
thousand<00:00:51.090> dollar<00:00:51.120> paint<00:00:51.480> job<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> Corvette

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
thousand dollar paint job on a Corvette

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
thousand dollar paint job on a Corvette
so<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.160> away<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.660> what<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.780> doing

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so I can get away with it what I'm doing

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
so I can get away with it what I'm doing
is<00:00:55.500> I've<00:00:55.860> put<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.160> three<00:00:56.520> coats<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
is I've put on three coats of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.619 
is I've put on three coats of
dupli-color<00:00:57.510> clear<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.460> around<00:01:00.239> these

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
dupli-color clear just on around these

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.910 
dupli-color clear just on around these
edges<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.440> where<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.680> shiny

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
edges and you can see where it's shiny

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119 
edges and you can see where it's shiny
right<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.960> take<00:01:04.920> my

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
right there what I'm gonna do is take my

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910 
right there what I'm gonna do is take my
thousand<00:01:05.640> grit<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> sand<00:01:06.380> around<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
thousand grit and sand around here and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.260 
thousand grit and sand around here and
see<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:10.250> fill<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> edges<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.000> make

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
see if I can fill in the edges that make

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
see if I can fill in the edges that make
it<00:01:12.450> smooth<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.740> my

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it smooth and that way when I go with my

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.080 
it smooth and that way when I go with my
next<00:01:17.460> color

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
next color

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.130

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
over and everything will just flow over

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.870 
over and everything will just flow over

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
decals very well because they're simply

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.420 
decals very well because they're simply
not<00:01:41.390> available<00:01:42.390> anymore<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> keep

can and I don't even know if this paint
will<00:01:53.579> stick<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> plastic<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.860> know

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
will stick to this plastic I don't know

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
will stick to this plastic I don't know
maybe<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> clearer<00:01:56.820> urethane<00:01:57.420> clarin<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
maybe the clearer urethane clarin will

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.539 
maybe the clearer urethane clarin will
hold<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.200> together<00:01:58.350> doesn't<00:01:59.250> matter<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
hold it all together doesn't matter to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
hold it all together doesn't matter to
me<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.820> long<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.360> holds<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.780> together

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
me as long as they holds it all together

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.950 
me as long as they holds it all together
but<00:02:01.979> without<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> summer<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.899> how

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
but without see this summer see how

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
but without see this summer see how
things<00:02:04.140> turn<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.549> then<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> give

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
right now this is this one area right

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.740 
right now this is this one area right
here<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.799> corner<00:04:06.189> where<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.329> happen<00:04:07.599> to

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
here in the corner where I happen to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.240 
here in the corner where I happen to
pull<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> paint<00:04:08.290> off<00:04:08.409> because<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.739> was<00:04:08.889> too<00:04:09.040> lazy

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
pull a paint off because I was too lazy

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.170

to<00:04:09.549> score<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.799> sandpaper<00:04:11.799> but<00:04:12.609> I<00:04:12.729> think<00:04:12.970> if<00:04:13.060> I

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
to score the sandpaper but I think if I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.030 
to score the sandpaper but I think if I
give<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.540> five<00:04:13.780> six<00:04:14.079> seven<00:04:14.500> coats<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.859> clear

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
give it five six seven coats of clear

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.250 
give it five six seven coats of clear
and<00:04:15.459> I'll<00:04:16.180> sand<00:04:16.419> them<00:04:16.599> down<00:04:16.630> I'm<00:04:17.049> going<00:04:17.200> to
