00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989

so<00:04:13.340> apparently<00:04:14.340> federal<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:16.250> using<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> same

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609

the best gold medal we've seen in years

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.249 
the best gold medal we've seen in years
I'm<00:04:44.490> certain<00:04:45.120> that's<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.389> best<00:04:45.689> ever

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
I'm certain that's the best ever

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.240 
I'm certain that's the best ever
as<00:04:46.530> far<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:46.949> federal<00:04:47.370> gold<00:04:47.520> medal<00:04:47.849> goes<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:49.590> it

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
as far as federal gold medal goes so it

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.830 
as far as federal gold medal goes so it
isn't<00:04:50.580> cheap<00:04:50.819> but<00:04:51.180> if<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.419> want<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:51.689> shoot

isn't cheap but if you want to shoot

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.209 
isn't cheap but if you want to shoot
tight<00:04:52.139> shoot<00:04:52.560> straight

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
tight shoot straight

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.570 
tight shoot straight
it's<00:04:53.939> worth<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.389> money<00:04:54.919> take<00:04:55.919> care<00:04:56.219> till<00:04:56.460> next

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
it's worth the money take care till next

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.930
