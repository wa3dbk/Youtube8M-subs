00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
issue in this stadium it does not seem

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.100 
issue in this stadium it does not seem
like<00:07:15.340> it<00:07:15.610> has<00:07:15.700> a<00:07:15.730> scraping<00:07:16.060> issue<00:07:16.360> so<00:07:16.930> this

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
like it has a scraping issue so this

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.320
