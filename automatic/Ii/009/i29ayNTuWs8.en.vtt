no reason that any of these three teams

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
no reason that any of these three teams

SCA<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.270> newbies<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.380> special<00:01:19.770> case

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
SCA and newbies a bit of a special case

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
SCA and newbies a bit of a special case

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
six at DAC I way the results at DAC far

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.609 
six at DAC I way the results at DAC far
higher<00:01:27.390> than<00:01:27.420> any<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:28.049> tournament<00:01:28.470> because

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
more stock into the DAC results than any

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
i think is very very impressive and I
think<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.820> are<00:02:02.880> only<00:02:03.299> two<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.899> take<00:02:04.079> home<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.830 
think these are only two to take home a
lot<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> lands<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.159> year<00:02:05.430> these<00:02:05.909> five<00:02:06.329> i<00:02:06.360> kind

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
from the China region these two teams

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.170 
from the China region these two teams
are<00:02:18.830> very<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:19.430> good<00:02:19.610> they<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> lot<00:02:20.150> of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
are very very good they have a lot of

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.510 
are very very good they have a lot of
star<00:02:20.510> power<00:02:20.540> they<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.230> pretty<00:02:22.040> darn<00:02:22.430> good

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
star power they have pretty darn good

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.479 
star power they have pretty darn good
results<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.270> they<00:02:23.750> are<00:02:23.930> cut<00:02:24.440> above<00:02:24.800> all<00:02:25.099> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
results and they are cut above all the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.120 
results and they are cut above all the
other<00:02:25.670> teams<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.420> region<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:27.590> well<00:02:27.650> as

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
other teams in this region as well as

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
other teams in this region as well as
both<00:02:28.519> of<00:02:28.640> them<00:02:28.760> participating<00:02:29.450> at<00:02:29.569> TI<00:02:29.840> last

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
both of them participating at TI last

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.650 
both of them participating at TI last
year<00:02:30.680> although<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.819> some<00:02:32.030> different<00:02:32.330> names

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
year although with some different names

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.960 
year although with some different names
so<00:02:32.959> i<00:02:33.140> think<00:02:33.290> these<00:02:33.500> two<00:02:33.769> are<00:02:33.819> probably<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so i think these two are probably the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.640 
so i think these two are probably the
quitter<00:02:35.239> choices<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:35.870> china<00:02:36.080> if<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.380> had<00:02:36.530> to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
quitter choices for china if you had to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
quitter choices for china if you had to
pick<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> two<00:02:37.390> next<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.569> Southeast<00:02:38.989> Asia

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
pick the two next for Southeast Asia

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.240 
pick the two next for Southeast Asia
Malaysia<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.120> rave<00:02:41.540> were<00:02:42.049> my<00:02:42.260> top<00:02:42.500> two<00:02:42.709> MVP

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
Malaysia and rave were my top two MVP

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.400 
Malaysia and rave were my top two MVP
probably<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> close<00:02:44.090> third<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:44.959> they

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
probably a close third but they

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830 
probably a close third but they
underwent<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.400> pretty<00:02:46.790> big<00:02:47.209> reshuffle

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
underwent a pretty big reshuffle

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
teams and the last one that we have is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.410 
teams and the last one that we have is
new<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> special<00:03:10.250> case<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.910> lot<00:03:11.329> of

new be a special case that a lot of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.699 
new be a special case that a lot of
people<00:03:11.660> probably<00:03:11.690> don't<00:03:12.019> think<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.590> will

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
people probably don't think they will

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.349 
people probably don't think they will
get<00:03:12.950> invited<00:03:13.370> by<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.700> personally<00:03:14.000> think<00:03:14.209> they

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
get invited by I personally think they

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.860 
get invited by I personally think they
will<00:03:14.570> firstly<00:03:14.989> its<00:03:15.260> valve<00:03:15.590> tradition<00:03:16.070> to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
will firstly its valve tradition to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.270 
will firstly its valve tradition to
invite<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.079> previous<00:03:18.530> year's<00:03:18.739> winner<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
invite the previous year's winner it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.310 
invite the previous year's winner it
seems<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.359> they<00:03:20.570> have<00:03:20.690> done<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.930> for<00:03:20.959> every

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
seems that they have done it for every

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.110 
seems that they have done it for every
single<00:03:21.530> TI<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.160> don't<00:03:22.459> really<00:03:22.670> see<00:03:22.819> a<00:03:22.850> good

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
single TI and I don't really see a good

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.420 
single TI and I don't really see a good
reason<00:03:23.510> for<00:03:23.690> them<00:03:24.410> not<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.799> do<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.160> year

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
reason for them not to do it this year

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160 
reason for them not to do it this year
yeah<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:25.970> might<00:03:26.209> say<00:03:26.239> they<00:03:26.480> had<00:03:26.569> poor<00:03:26.810> results

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
yeah you might say they had poor results

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.729 
yeah you might say they had poor results
but<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.980> did<00:03:28.250> Alliance<00:03:29.209> last<00:03:29.450> year<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.500> did

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
but so did Alliance last year and so did

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.090 
but so did Alliance last year and so did
Navi<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.480> off<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.989> year<00:03:33.109> before<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:33.859> I

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
Navi on and off the year before so I

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.890 
Navi on and off the year before so I
don't<00:03:34.280> think<00:03:34.489> that's<00:03:34.640> terribly<00:03:35.090> unusual<00:03:35.269> for

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
don't think that's terribly unusual for

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.340 
don't think that's terribly unusual for
the<00:03:36.019> TI<00:03:36.280> champion<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.569> they<00:03:38.569> haven't<00:03:39.019> had<00:03:39.139> too

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the TI champion and they haven't had too

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.110 
the TI champion and they haven't had too
many<00:03:39.440> grocery<00:03:39.920> shuffles<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.940> have<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
many grocery shuffles and you have to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.300 
many grocery shuffles and you have to
consider<00:03:41.299> house<00:03:41.569> damn<00:03:41.930> scary<00:03:42.380> they<00:03:42.650> were<00:03:42.709> last

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
consider house damn scary they were last

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.629 
consider house damn scary they were last
year<00:03:43.639> making<00:03:43.880> their<00:03:44.120> run<00:03:44.680> at<00:03:45.680> key<00:03:46.069> arena<00:03:46.100> and

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
year making their run at key arena and
