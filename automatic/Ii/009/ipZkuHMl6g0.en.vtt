00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
all my multiple desktops this is because

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.800 
all my multiple desktops this is because
the<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.799> day<00:01:08.009> desktop<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.509> the

the first day desktop and start on the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
the first day desktop and start on the
mac<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:11.090> macbook<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:13.369> always<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> furthest<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
mac or macbook is always the furthest to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
mac or macbook is always the furthest to
the<00:01:15.090> left<00:01:15.179> and<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.229> dashboard<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.100> normally

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the left and this dashboard is normally

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.800 
the left and this dashboard is normally
directly<00:01:18.240> left<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.950> therefore<00:01:20.630> far<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
directly left of that therefore far to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
directly left of that therefore far to
the<00:01:21.899> right<00:01:21.929> is<00:01:22.229> better<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:25.979> will<00:01:26.490> notice

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the right is better so you will notice

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
the right is better so you will notice
that<00:01:27.090> I've<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.420> drag<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.929> dashboard<00:01:28.440> now<00:01:28.679> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that I've also drag the dashboard now in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940 
that I've also drag the dashboard now in
between<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.819> desktops<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.619> also<00:01:31.799> be

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
between the desktops this can also be

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.850 
between the desktops this can also be
done<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> dragon<00:01:34.440> far<00:01:34.679> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
done I don't use it so I dragon far to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.950 
done I don't use it so I dragon far to
the<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:37.100> think<00:01:39.619> that

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
the right so I think that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.780 
the right so I think that
but<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.260> best<00:01:43.500> position<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.370> but<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
but is the best position for me but you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
but is the best position for me but you
can<00:01:45.030> put<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.480> between<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.230> wish<00:01:46.440> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can put it in between if you wish I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.940 
can put it in between if you wish I
stick<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.730> right<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.680> remove<00:01:49.680> an<00:01:49.830> app

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
stick it to the right and remove an app

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.540 
stick it to the right and remove an app

just<00:02:02.400> used<00:02:02.580> two<00:02:02.790> fingers<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.390> pinch<00:02:03.600> together

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
just used two fingers to pinch together

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.830 
just used two fingers to pinch together
and<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:05.100> reduces<00:02:05.430> tabs<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.750> have

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and that reduces tabs so if you have

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.440 
and that reduces tabs so if you have
multiple<00:02:07.020> tabs<00:02:07.530> open<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.040> safari<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:09.179> pitch
