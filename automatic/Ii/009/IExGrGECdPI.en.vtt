you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.879> there's<00:01:00.750> nothing<00:01:00.840> wrong<00:01:01.050> with

going<00:01:01.469> west<00:01:01.859> west<00:01:02.520> sounds<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> good

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
going west west sounds like a good

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.020 
going west west sounds like a good
direction<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.719> than<00:01:03.899> any<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.680> Sun

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
direction more than any other the Sun

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.539 
direction more than any other the Sun
sets<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> west<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.490> guess

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
sets in the west so that's I guess

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
sets in the west so that's I guess
something<00:01:09.210> good<00:01:09.590> um<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.780> going
