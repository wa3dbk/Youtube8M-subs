little<00:01:16.020> handle<00:01:16.380> I've<00:01:16.560> designed<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
little handle I've designed here on the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.870 
little handle I've designed here on the
side<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> tail<00:01:18.570> light<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
side with the tail light and we have the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.050 
side with the tail light and we have the
brakes<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.020> conventional<00:01:22.710> position<00:01:23.220> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
brakes in the conventional position for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.050 
brakes in the conventional position for
a<00:01:24.090> sidekick<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.799> walk<00:01:26.040> around<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a sidekick now as we walk around the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
a sidekick now as we walk around the
other<00:01:27.180> side<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> bike<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.350> when

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
other side of the bike this is when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
other side of the bike this is when
things<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.130> become<00:01:29.630> different<00:01:30.680> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
things really become different the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
things really become different the
brakes<00:01:32.040> were<00:01:32.280> moved<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> rear<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
brakes were moved to the rear of the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.530 
brakes were moved to the rear of the
wheel<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.320> left<00:01:34.470> side<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> bike<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
wheel on the left side of the bike the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.230 
wheel on the left side of the bike the
reason<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.140> being<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.729> an

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
reason for that being we have an

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.039 
reason for that being we have an
additional<00:01:39.840> derailleur<00:01:40.500> under<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.820> that

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
additional derailleur under here that

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.780 
additional derailleur under here that
will<00:01:43.130> give<00:01:44.130> us<00:01:44.159> 24<00:01:44.579> speeds<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.079> camp<00:01:46.350> cycle

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
will give us 24 speeds on the camp cycle

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.719 
will give us 24 speeds on the camp cycle
and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.450> chain<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> ran<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and the chain I ran right into the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.870 
and the chain I ran right into the
mounting<00:01:51.570> position<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.220> brakes<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.729> they

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
mounting position of the brakes if they

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
mounting position of the brakes if they
were<00:01:53.939> forward<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.229> needed<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
were forward there so we needed that for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.380 
were forward there so we needed that for
clearance<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.960> two

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
clearance you can see we have two

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.530 
clearance you can see we have two
controllers<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> derailleurs<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.540> here

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
controllers for the derailleurs and here

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
controllers for the derailleurs and here
we<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:04.560> bit<00:02:04.710> better<00:02:04.950> view<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
we can get a little bit better view of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.550 
we can get a little bit better view of
the<00:02:06.439> transmission

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the transmission

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
the transmission
and<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.789> chain<00:02:10.479> guard<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:12.550> drive<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:13.300> here

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and the chain guard the drive up here

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.790 
and the chain guard the drive up here
and<00:02:16.350> that's<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:17.890> about<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.650> said

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and that's really about it like I said

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.260 
and that's really about it like I said
we'll<00:02:21.070> have<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.430> available<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:24.270> probably

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
we'll have this available in probably

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.590 
we'll have this available in probably
about<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.660> month<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.790> look<00:02:27.970> forward<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
about a month and so we look forward to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.350 
about a month and so we look forward to
hearing<00:02:29.260> from<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:29.740> our<00:02:30.070> camp<00:02:30.940> cycle
