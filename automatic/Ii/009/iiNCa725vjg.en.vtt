series switch now singing you know I I
don't<00:00:18.359> even<00:00:18.600> know<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.140> ever<00:00:19.230> done<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
don't even know if I've ever done it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
don't even know if I've ever done it
just<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.949> switch<00:00:20.250> manual<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.510> switch<00:00:21.750> frontside

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
just a switch manual to switch frontside

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.519 
just a switch manual to switch frontside
180<00:00:22.470> I've<00:00:23.130> definitely<00:00:23.490> done<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.090> 180<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
180 I've definitely done like 180 in to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
180 I've definitely done like 180 in to
180<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.789> that's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.060> lot<00:00:27.210> easier<00:00:27.269> keep

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
180 out but that's a lot easier keep

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.560 
180 out but that's a lot easier keep
that<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.380> mind<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.099> thing<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
that in mind because the thing about a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
that in mind because the thing about a
switch<00:00:30.570> mini<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.199> any<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.769> manny<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.279> 180

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
switch mini or any kind of manny to 180

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
switch mini or any kind of manny to 180
out<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> end<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.390> while<00:00:33.780> you're<00:00:34.020> manually

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
out at the end is while you're manually

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
out at the end is while you're manually
you<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> turning<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.910> upper<00:00:36.239> body

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you have to be turning your upper body

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
you have to be turning your upper body
and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.920> able<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> 180<00:00:38.489> out

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and then you have to be able to 180 out

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
and then you have to be able to 180 out
at<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> end<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.329> kind<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> feeling

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
at the end I kind of have the feeling

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
at the end I kind of have the feeling
that<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.969> trick<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that I'm gonna do this trick and it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
that I'm gonna do this trick and it's
gonna<00:00:42.690> look<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.110> bad<00:00:44.329> because<00:00:45.329> regular

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
gonna look really bad because regular

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
gonna look really bad because regular
180<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:47.070> enough<00:00:47.309> control<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
180 out I have enough control where I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
180 out I have enough control where I
can<00:00:48.390> pop<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> actually<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
can pop it and actually do a kind of a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.959 
can pop it and actually do a kind of a
180

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
180

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.639 
180
but<00:00:51.360> switch<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.020> know<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but switch I don't know if I have that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
but switch I don't know if I have that
much<00:00:52.829> control<00:00:53.719> actually<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:54.960> thing

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
much control actually the first thing

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.270 
much control actually the first thing
I'm<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> gonna<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I'm going to do is I'm just gonna do a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.720 
I'm going to do is I'm just gonna do a
regular

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
regular

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
regular
Nannie<00:00:57.239> 180<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:58.980> switch

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
Nannie 180 then I'm gonna do some switch

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
Nannie 180 then I'm gonna do some switch
manney<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.760> let's<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
manney so let's see if I can get this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.260 
manney so let's see if I can get this
pretty<00:01:01.469> fast<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
pretty fast so you see on that one I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
pretty fast so you see on that one I
barely<00:01:09.960> popped<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> barely<00:01:11.580> ollied

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
barely popped out like I barely ollied

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
barely popped out like I barely ollied
when<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> did<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.840> 180<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.909> I'll

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
when I did that 180 out so you know I'll

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999 
when I did that 180 out so you know I'll
just<00:01:15.540> we'll<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.409> how<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> goes<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
just we'll just see how this goes I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
just we'll just see how this goes I
guess<00:01:17.159> let's<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.540> switch

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
guess let's just do it do some switch

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.410 
guess let's just do it do some switch
Manny

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.330

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
man switch pin switch man II feel so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.330 
man switch pin switch man II feel so
good<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:28.100> gotta<00:01:29.100> learn<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> push<00:01:29.789> switch<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
reason whenever I ollie into a switch

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
reason whenever I ollie into a switch
Manny<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.490> Brian<00:01:42.030> winning<00:01:45.409> okay<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
now the difficult part comes in

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
now the difficult part comes in
where<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.289> actually<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.679> turning<00:01:50.189> my

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.160 
head and upper body while in the Manny
that<00:01:55.709> takes<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:57.509> takes<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.840> lot<00:01:57.959> more

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that takes some that takes a lot more

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.340 
that takes some that takes a lot more
control<00:01:58.500> than<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.979> might<00:01:59.159> think

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.380 

whoo<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.909> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> people<00:02:06.209> are<00:02:06.270> probably

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
whoo a lot of people are probably
