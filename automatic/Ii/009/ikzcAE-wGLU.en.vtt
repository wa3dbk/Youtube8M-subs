00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
you do not use your gun until you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.800 
you do not use your gun until you
absolutely<00:03:13.739> need<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.180> will<00:03:15.420> show<00:03:15.450> you

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.320 

this<00:03:30.020> area<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:30.650> gets<00:03:31.550> me<00:03:31.730> very<00:03:31.760> paranoid

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
this area here gets me very paranoid

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.480 
this area here gets me very paranoid

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
because I don't know there's actually a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:46.910 
because I don't know there's actually a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.130 

never<00:03:47.670> has<00:03:47.910> been<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.150> zombie<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.660> there<00:03:48.840> never

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
never has been a zombie in there never

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.160 
never has been a zombie in there never
