00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.969
 Hi there, this is another review on my 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.049
 the channel after all we will consider the car on 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.730
 radio control 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:22.470
 porsche 911 gt3 rs 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 from the company rastar scale model 1 24 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.040
 let's see what else is written on the box 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.040
 it means there is an icon 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.620
 move forward backward turn left 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 right toy is designed for children 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 from 6 years 6 plus what else 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:53.120
 It is written that it works on frequency 40 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:57.590
 megahertz this by the way is very suitable for 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.140
 those who have a machine want the second 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 typewriter and in order to roll 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.729
 at the same time let's say if 1 machine on 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.530
 frequency of 27 megahertz then this machine 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.290
 will be suitable because it is on the other 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.479
 frequency of 40 megahertz that is it will be possible 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:24.910
 roll two cars at once sticker 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:27.410
 supplier and at the bottom of the box there are 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.310
 Description of how many batteries are required and 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.759
 how to insert them that is for the machine 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.869
 you need three batteries 2 and for 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.570
 control panel 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.930
 two batteries powered by 2 batteries i 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.220
 prepared here they stand here so 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.220
 put the machine and try to insert 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 battery 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.130
 here is our view of the box 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.140
 circle leave here so see the remote 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.070
 of management 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:40.780
 it is attached to the bolt now try 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:43.780
 unscrewing all this is also attached below 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 unscrew 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.319
 But in general, the whole equipment is itself 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 the machine is such a nice orange 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.510
 color and remote control remote 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.250
 joystick control and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.650
 which of course, well, not so sad but 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.300
 as it says that this is a child 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.130
 toy and 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.800
 a lot of this machine is not worth the wait 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:32.739
 let's try to insert batteries 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:37.420
 again here we see mounts on the baltic 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.680
 which is not very convenient in that if 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.670
 you suddenly have all the batteries here and under 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.019
 hand will not be a screwdriver then I 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:53.380
 will be problematic that is more 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.790
 serious models everything is done on 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.730
 clips to at any time 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.209
 it was possible to open compartments and change 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.209
 batteries 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.840
 a little hurry to 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.030
 quickly do but as you can see 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.160
 so, but with the remote control Iâ€™m checking myself 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.160
 lights light up everything is inserted correctly 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:46.690
 everything works typewriter cars again see 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:48.930
 I already explained this fastening with a screw 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.080
 why not so good 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:57.669
 I will not repeat polarity 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:04.360
 here the pictures are all very clear and 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:06.280
 available inserted batteries and translate 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:15.880
 toggle to the position he is here he was already 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:16.660
 in the position he therefore check here 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:25.990
 machine 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:27.210
 and back and forth and turns the steering wheel headlight 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.220
 why do n't they burn 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:37.870
 although they should be on fire, I do not know 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:42.960
 Probably some kind of marriage caught here 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:50.880
 general and all the way quietly can 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:54.340
 roll the feeling that the batteries 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.220
 the runners are not enough power by the way for 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:02.919
 it can and lights do not burn therefore 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:06.460
 I advise you not to put good batteries 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:11.009
 saves on her about maybe what 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.009
 here are the options 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.050
 Well, probably this is all 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.880
 percent machine I can say it's worth it 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.880
 around 600 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:29.360
 800 rubles online stores without 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.930
 problems you can find them 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.250
 but it is only natural to use it 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.000
 home conditions that is, this machine is not 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.610
 for the street 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.220
 this toy is for kids on this finish 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.310
 subscribe to the channel thanks for 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.310
 Attention
