I've actually got a new seat on here
this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.339> higher<00:01:05.930> back<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.650> much<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this is much higher back not much a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
this is much higher back not much a
little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.580> higher<00:01:08.729> back<00:01:08.970> definitely<00:01:09.570> more

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
little bit higher back definitely more

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.120

rigid<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> seat<00:01:11.340> bottom<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:12.710> not<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> lot

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
rigid but the seat bottom is not a lot

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.719 
rigid but the seat bottom is not a lot

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so it's actually a kind of hard so this

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
so it's actually a kind of hard so this
is<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:17.970> old<00:01:18.150> harmony<00:01:18.840> seat<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.220> know

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
is an old harmony seat that you know

is an old harmony seat that you know
like<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.509> used<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
like one of the first times I used it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
like one of the first times I used it
increased<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
increased the the back of it so what I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
increased the the back of it so what I
did<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.640> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> cannibalize<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.900> thing

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
did was I kind of cannibalize this thing

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
did was I kind of cannibalize this thing
this<00:01:28.259> seat<00:01:28.710> backs<00:01:28.920> no<00:01:29.130> good<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> did<00:01:30.360> take

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this seat backs no good but I did take

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
this seat backs no good but I did take
the<00:01:31.700> clips<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.530> those<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the clips off it so I can use those that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
the clips off it so I can use those that
I<00:01:35.009> think<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.400> four<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.820> them<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> can

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I think there's four of them so I can

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
I think there's four of them so I can
use<00:01:36.780> those<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.259> tie<00:01:38.040> downs<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> stuff<00:01:38.759> but

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
use those for tie downs and stuff but

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.020
