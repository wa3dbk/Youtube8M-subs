going to take this little tiny pro I'm

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.650 
going to take this little tiny pro I'm
gonna<00:01:49.190> slide<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:49.520> under<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.820> skin<00:01:50.150> it's

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
gonna slide this under the skin it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.320 
gonna slide this under the skin it's
going<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> squirt<00:01:51.110> out<00:01:51.260> numbing<00:01:51.650> fluid<00:01:52.330> let's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
going to squirt out numbing fluid let's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to squirt out numbing fluid let's
start<00:01:53.420> using<00:01:53.690> my<00:01:53.870> laser<00:01:54.080> now<00:01:54.470> by<00:01:54.890> putting

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
start using my laser now by putting

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.950 
start using my laser now by putting
laser<00:01:55.460> energy<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.150> here<00:01:56.480> what<00:01:56.660> we're<00:01:56.780> actually

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
laser energy in here what we're actually

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.510 
laser energy in here what we're actually
doing<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.530> we're<00:01:57.650> creating<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:58.100> tightening

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
doing is we're creating a tightening

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.220 
doing is we're creating a tightening
effect<00:01:58.610> for<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.180> which<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.900> going<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.080> give

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
effect for it which is going to give

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.599 
tiny hole that we make in the skin and
we<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.470> laser<00:03:25.680> lift<00:03:26.099> one<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.489> they're

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
we put the laser lift one and they're

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.949 
we put the laser lift one and they're
going<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.849> call<00:03:26.940> just<00:03:27.180> three<00:03:27.420> main<00:03:27.599> effects

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
going to call just three main effects

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.589 
going to call just three main effects
the<00:03:28.200> first<00:03:28.409> effect<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.190> melting<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.299> some<00:03:30.510> of

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
the first effect is melting of some of

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.390 
the first effect is melting of some of
the<00:03:30.690> fat<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:30.959> lives<00:03:31.379> between<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.099> skin<00:03:32.340> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the fat that lives between the skin and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.190 
the fat that lives between the skin and
the<00:03:32.549> muscle<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.329> second<00:03:33.720> effect<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the muscle the second effect is the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.229 
the muscle the second effect is the
laser<00:03:34.470> energy<00:03:34.950> into<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> smash<00:03:35.609> or<00:03:35.879> that<00:03:36.000> deep

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
laser energy into the smash or that deep

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.449 
laser energy into the smash or that deep
tissue<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:37.079> we<00:03:37.200> typically<00:03:37.530> suture<00:03:38.189> in<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
tissue that we typically suture in a

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.339 
tissue that we typically suture in a
surgical<00:03:38.700> facelift<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.599> then<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.170> last

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
surgical facelift and then the last

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.929 
surgical facelift and then the last
effect<00:03:40.829> when<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.069> turn<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.430> laser<00:03:41.639> lift<00:03:41.879> the

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
effect when we turn that laser lift the

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.280 
effect when we turn that laser lift the
one<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.269> face<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.599> up<00:03:42.810> underneath<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
one and face it up underneath the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.809 
one and face it up underneath the
surface<00:03:43.439> of<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.859> skin<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:44.519> skin

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
surface of the skin is to get skin

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.240 
surface of the skin is to get skin
tightening<00:03:45.560> also<00:03:46.560> what's<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:46.829> unique<00:03:46.980> about

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
tightening also what's so unique about

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.770 
tightening also what's so unique about
this<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.180> real<00:03:48.480> time

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
this is that we have real time

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.420 
this is that we have real time
temperature<00:03:49.230> feedback<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> tip<00:03:50.189> of<00:03:50.220> this

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
temperature feedback in the tip of this

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
temperature feedback in the tip of this
laser<00:03:50.670> lift<00:03:50.939> wand<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.019> prevent<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.349> burn

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
laser lift wand so we can prevent a burn

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.110 
laser lift wand so we can prevent a burn
so<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.340> all<00:03:53.430> about<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.760> heat<00:03:53.940> is

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
so because it's all about the heat is

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.800 
so because it's all about the heat is
happy<00:03:54.480> that's<00:03:54.750> getting<00:03:55.079> shrinkage<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
happy that's getting shrinkage and

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.479 
happy that's getting shrinkage and
causing<00:03:57.810> more<00:03:58.049> collagen<00:03:58.560> elastin<00:03:58.980> formation

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
causing more collagen elastin formation

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.670 
causing more collagen elastin formation
absolutely<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.239> seeing<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.019> close<00:04:01.319> you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
absolutely and seeing you this close you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.530 
absolutely and seeing you this close you
look<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.250> look<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.819> good<00:04:03.060> i'm<00:04:03.239> gonna<00:04:03.389> show

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
look you look really good i'm gonna show

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.210 
look you look really good i'm gonna show
everyone<00:04:03.690> again<00:04:04.079> your<00:04:04.680> before

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.250 

and<00:04:09.730> really<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.060> profile<00:04:10.660> thing<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:10.990> when<00:04:11.140> you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
and really a profile thing is when you

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.310 
and really a profile thing is when you
see<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.820> most<00:04:12.820> pronounced<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.930> insulator

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
see it most pronounced in the insulator

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.780 
see it most pronounced in the insulator
you're<00:04:14.710> happy<00:04:14.920> that's<00:04:15.220> what<00:04:15.340> matters<00:04:15.460> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
you're happy that's what matters the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.430 
you're happy that's what matters the
most<00:04:16.000> thanks<00:04:16.690> for<00:04:16.810> coming<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:17.079> shore<00:04:17.260> dr

most thanks for coming on shore dr

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.910 
most thanks for coming on shore dr
bhasin<00:04:17.859> thank<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.160> as<00:04:18.280> well<00:04:18.310> good<00:04:18.609> stuff
