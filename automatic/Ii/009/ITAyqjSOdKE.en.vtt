00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 the tunnel leaves no more practice 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 Old men did not lack a race, I'm going to talk. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 He lets it see there I said is not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.390
 missing people 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:44.129
 tommy têtu came back and came back with everything 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:47.039
 Please, let's see, is this it? 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.700
 we returned and the next a while ago 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.320
 behind us only at osorio's rodeo and with 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.190
 help from our friend stamp of tradition 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.260
 in this value and I am worth them 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.070
 with the help of the staff the pain was in the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 tradition 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.500
 we did a search for some some 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 friends in these last one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 Elat 's celebrity is that we 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.479
 picture this was some photos 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 one of them went back to the streets on the internet we 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.450
 We're just borrowing it. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.689
 the pictures 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.840
 and then we look for people in these ways 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.000
 so take a look at stay tuned and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
 That's where the committee is going to start now. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.549
 on the Rodeo osório will see nothing cpf 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.619
 that it is absurd that it has just 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.869
 This is a fable 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.700
 some questions to ask him out 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.920
 we got some information from the network 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.049
 Let's play a little game. 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.899
 Actually, we want to search for 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.520
 two people with two people 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.229
 We'll talk to him to see if the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.490
 people find these two people 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.619
 We're just leaving the instructor. 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 stop talking to them or people 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 Interact, I delegated that, come on. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 Who are you , people? 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.570
 so he also decided that with this, who 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 wins the following imagina only knows that the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.580
 people are always looking for things in 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.160
 The network would reach miles and talk 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.500
 I love my friend was in the selection 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.450
 He showed me a photo by selecting 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.920
 room can use these two photos there and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.510
 if you want to find the staff to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 understand what happened and jesus did not 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.830
 understand in interpretation a very thing 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.300
 The wave was at least for me I did not 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.190
 I would like to music and interpretation 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.630

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.480
 I want to know if you know this person. 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.349

 this year in this person here but are 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.819
 You also understand seeing this is all your fault. 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.060

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.569

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 Okay, she interpreted it as described in 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.660
 book he has to do this 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.610

 he is then he's there he's in there 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.909
 Green brigade years knows that the internet 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.989
 today is a very good medium of communication 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:16.870
 It's all fast disastrous too. 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.129
 the agenda is another person who was 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.400
 in tradition 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.760
 they chose two pictures and everything and everything 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.210
 What I want the way we want it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.520

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.700
 ae brought 90 transiting to watch 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.940
 the other if it gets a bad moment from the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.670
 even sport so that you spoke to him and 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.819

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.550

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.270
 with the varzim of ii today as it is a matter of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.810

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.640
