00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
evidence of it left anywhere I don't

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.150 
evidence of it left anywhere I don't
know<00:03:19.910> why<00:03:20.060> anybody<00:03:20.239> would<00:03:20.450> believe<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:21.160> but

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
know why anybody would believe that but

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.640 
know why anybody would believe that but
again<00:03:22.459> if<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:23.030> use<00:03:23.060> meaningful<00:03:23.959> standards

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
again if we use meaningful standards

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
again if we use meaningful standards
then<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.670> look<00:03:25.910> at<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> historical<00:03:26.720> situation

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
then we look at the historical situation

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.920 
then we look at the historical situation
we<00:03:27.620> see<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.010> historically<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.420> Apostle

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.990 
we see that historically the Apostle
Paul<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.350> accepted<00:03:31.070> by<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.400> other<00:03:31.640> apostles

they are preaching the same gospel if

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.580 
they are preaching the same gospel if

with those of Paul record and Luke guess

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.500 
with those of Paul record and Luke guess
what<00:03:43.890> they're<00:03:44.640> using<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> same<00:03:45.299> Old

now<00:03:53.400> was<00:03:53.640> Peter<00:03:54.030> then<00:03:54.329> somehow<00:03:55.280> corrupted<00:03:56.280> was

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
now was Peter then somehow corrupted was

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.819 
now was Peter then somehow corrupted was
was<00:03:56.970> Peter<00:03:57.269> not<00:03:57.840> one<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.200> apostles<00:03:58.739> of

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
was Peter not one of the apostles of

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.350 
was Peter not one of the apostles of
Jesus<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.459> Quran<00:03:59.760> says<00:04:00.060> would<00:04:00.269> be

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
Jesus that the Quran says would be

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.539 
Jesus that the Quran says would be
victorious<00:04:00.900> until<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.349> day<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.799> judgment<00:04:02.340> and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
victorious until the day of judgment and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.360 
victorious until the day of judgment and
that<00:04:03.239> becomes<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.780> question<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.409> so<00:04:04.709> once

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
that becomes the question and so once

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.390 
that becomes the question and so once
again<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.909> just<00:04:06.329> have<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.659> turn<00:04:06.870> back<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.440> mr.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
again I just have to turn back to mr.
