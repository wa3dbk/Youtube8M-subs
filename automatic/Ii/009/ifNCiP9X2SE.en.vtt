have<00:01:40.829> an<00:01:41.130> attachment<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.469> looks<00:01:43.680> like

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have an attachment and and it looks like

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429 
have an attachment and and it looks like
you<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.070> able<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> add<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> scope<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you are able to add a scope to it one of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.450 
you are able to add a scope to it one of
the<00:01:46.500> things<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> i<00:01:46.829> also<00:01:47.040> wanted<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> mention

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

is you know if you look it up on google
these<00:01:49.799> images<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:50.969> if

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
these images you are going to see if

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
these images you are going to see if
this<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.240> an<00:01:51.540> actual<00:01:51.750> pistol<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:53.039> was<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.310> of

this is an actual pistol it was one of
the<00:01:53.460> pistols<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.030> used<00:01:54.299> during<00:01:54.420> World

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.670 
using this a lot and a lot of people are
making<00:01:58.530> jokes<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.369> Han<00:01:59.700> Solo's

pistol head that he'd used in Star Wars

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
pistol head that he'd used in Star Wars
and<00:02:03.270> technically<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.890> variation

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and technically it is it's a variation

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
and technically it is it's a variation
of<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.000> he<00:02:06.060> uses<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
of that one that he uses in that in that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.219 
of that one that he uses in that in that
movie<00:02:07.789> but<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> whole<00:02:09.570> point<00:02:09.810> is

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
movie but you know the whole point is

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.650 
movie but you know the whole point is
that<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> schematic<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.850> also<00:02:12.180> shows<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that it is schematic it also shows a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.240 
that it is schematic it also shows a
scope<00:02:13.020> attachment<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.710> lot<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.890> people<00:02:13.980> are

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250

like<00:02:14.400> well<00:02:14.580> does<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:14.940> mean<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.350> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
like well does this mean you is it a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.890 
like well does this mean you is it a
package<00:02:16.950> version<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.819> but<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
package version of it but I think that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.530 
package version of it but I think that
it<00:02:19.200> might<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.860> new<00:02:20.430> buildable<00:02:20.970> weapon<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it might be a new buildable weapon and I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.970 
it might be a new buildable weapon and I
don't<00:02:21.780> mean<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.319> terms<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.709> like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
don't mean this in terms of like

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910 
don't mean this in terms of like
jet<00:02:23.250> gun<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> jet<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.180> horrible<00:02:24.920> weapon

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
jet gun the jet was a horrible weapon

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.530 
jet gun the jet was a horrible weapon
that<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> could<00:02:26.400> build<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.819> buildable<00:02:27.180> weapon

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
that you could build a buildable weapon

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.759 
that you could build a buildable weapon
I'm<00:02:27.629> not<00:02:27.720> even<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.110> call<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.470> wonder

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
I'm not even going to call it a wonder

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.039 
I'm not even going to call it a wonder
weapon<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:29.159> how<00:02:29.310> bad<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> was

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
weapon that's how bad it was but it was

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.440 
weapon that's how bad it was but it was
a<00:02:31.080> buildable<00:02:31.830> weapon<00:02:32.159> nonetheless<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.879> think

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
a buildable weapon nonetheless I think

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.740 
a buildable weapon nonetheless I think
that<00:02:33.930> maybe<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.620> new<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.069> new<00:02:35.190> mauser

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
that maybe the new one the new mauser

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.920 
that maybe the new one the new mauser
c96<00:02:37.940> oh<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.239> replace<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
c96 oh it's going to replace it and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
c96 oh it's going to replace it and
maybe<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.769> might<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.430> pretty<00:02:42.209> cool<00:02:42.450> pack<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
maybe we might see a pretty cool pack a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.880 
maybe we might see a pretty cool pack a
punch<00:02:42.989> version<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.500> think<00:02:43.709> you're<00:02:43.799> going

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
punch version but I think you're going

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
punch version but I think you're going
to<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.069> able<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.549> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.849> find<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.390> scope

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
can be able to add to it make it more of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.750 
can be able to add to it make it more of
a<00:02:57.150> rifle<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.079> make<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.890> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
a rifle if you want to make it more of a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.509 
a rifle if you want to make it more of a
machine<00:03:00.180> gun-type<00:03:01.019> weapon<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.340> know

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
machine gun-type weapon so you know

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.130 
machine gun-type weapon so you know
obviously<00:03:02.760> its<00:03:03.120> attachments<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:03.720> also

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
obviously its attachments there also

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.449 
obviously its attachments there also
shows<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.739> like<00:03:04.859> one<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.069> his<00:03:05.250> file

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
shows that this is like one of his file

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
shows that this is like one of his file
so<00:03:05.640> obviously<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.120> going<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.329> be<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.900> know

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
so obviously is going to be you know

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.449 
so obviously is going to be you know
quite<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.230> bit<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.530> different<00:03:07.859> weapons<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.340> this

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
quite a bit of different weapons in this
