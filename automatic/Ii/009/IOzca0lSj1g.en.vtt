scarlet two parts yellow one part burnt
umber<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.370> five<00:02:13.880> parts<00:02:14.300> water<00:02:14.540> make<00:02:15.500> quite<00:02:15.740> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
umber and five parts water make quite a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.260 
umber and five parts water make quite a
lot<00:02:16.070> us<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.370> need<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.760> cover<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.150> entire

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
lot us you need to cover the entire

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.230 
lot us you need to cover the entire
canvas<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.350> find<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.160> montmartre<00:02:19.610> hundred<00:02:20.030> mil

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
canvas I find the montmartre hundred mil

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.560 
canvas I find the montmartre hundred mil
range<00:02:20.570> great<00:02:21.140> for<00:02:21.410> covering<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> larger<00:02:22.130> area

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
range great for covering the larger area

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.290 
range great for covering the larger area
now<00:02:23.570> we've<00:02:23.750> got<00:02:23.900> our<00:02:23.930> paint<00:02:24.350> mixed<00:02:24.740> up<00:02:25.300> let's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
slap it on the canvas and this is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.470 
slap it on the canvas and this is
absolutely<00:02:30.590> fantastic<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:32.390> an

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
absolutely fantastic for an

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.790 
absolutely fantastic for an
underpainting<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.380> dries<00:02:33.590> so

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
underpainting because it dries so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.590 
underpainting because it dries so
quickly<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.610> try<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:34.850> get<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> nice<00:02:35.330> even

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
quickly just try and get a nice even

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.490 
quickly just try and get a nice even
surface<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.300> see<00:02:38.510> how<00:02:38.750> beautifully<00:02:39.470> it

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
surface you can see how beautifully it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:50.050 
surface you can see how beautifully it
flows<00:02:39.860> across<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.459> surface

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.900 

that's<00:02:50.720> our<00:02:50.989> under<00:02:51.290> painting<00:02:51.530> done<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
that's our under painting done you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.100 
that's our under painting done you
should<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:53.209> able<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.569> see<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.870> drawing

should be able to see you drawing

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.900 
should be able to see you drawing
through<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:54.980> let's<00:02:55.160> put<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> next<00:02:55.700> part

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
through that so let's put the next part

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.050 
through that so let's put the next part
on<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:57.110> mix<00:02:57.290> up<00:02:57.440> our<00:02:57.590> background<00:02:58.130> colors<00:02:58.489> we're

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
on to mix up our background colors we're

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.809 
on to mix up our background colors we're
going<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.300> use<00:02:59.540> my<00:02:59.840> fellow<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.739> black<00:03:01.099> for<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
going to use my fellow and black for the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.540 
going to use my fellow and black for the
dark<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.810> top<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> bottom<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.590> to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
dark on the top and the bottom and to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.220 
dark on the top and the bottom and to
make<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> beautiful<00:03:05.000> rich<00:03:05.510> green<00:03:05.840> we're<00:03:06.050> going

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
make a beautiful rich green we're going

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.280 
make a beautiful rich green we're going
to<00:03:06.319> use<00:03:06.500> lemon<00:03:06.950> yellow<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.459> place<00:03:07.700> hello<00:03:07.910> blue

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.679 

another<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.579> trick<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.879> like<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.360> do<00:03:13.510> is

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
another little trick I like to do is

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.190 
another little trick I like to do is
instead<00:03:14.439> of<00:03:14.650> mixing<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.579> paint<00:03:15.819> in<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
instead of mixing the paint in the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.199 
instead of mixing the paint in the
palette<00:03:17.859> I'm<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.549> mix<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.819> directly

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
palette I'm going to mix it directly

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.660 
palette I'm going to mix it directly
onto<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.659> canvas<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.319> just<00:03:21.069> creates<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.519> little

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
onto the canvas it just creates a little

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.089 
onto the canvas it just creates a little
bit<00:03:21.790> more<00:03:22.030> interest<00:03:22.480> though<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.530> green<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:24.069> a

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
bit more interest though the green is a

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.610 
bit more interest though the green is a
mix<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.579> one<00:03:24.879> part<00:03:25.180> per<00:03:25.239> fellow<00:03:25.599> and<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.319> past

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
mix of one part per fellow and for past

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.860 
mix of one part per fellow and for past
lemon<00:03:27.099> yellow

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.080 

you<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.049> really<00:03:33.500> see<00:03:33.890> how<00:03:34.129> well<00:03:34.430> these<00:03:34.640> paints

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
you can really see how well these paints

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.640 
you can really see how well these paints
cover<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.540> canvas<00:03:35.959> here<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:42.170> I'm<00:03:42.439> going<00:03:42.590> to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
cover the canvas here now I'm going to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.869 
cover the canvas here now I'm going to
introduce<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.400> technique<00:03:43.849> called

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
introduce you to a technique called

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.899 
introduce you to a technique called
stumbling<00:03:44.719> and<00:03:45.099> that's<00:03:46.099> basically<00:03:46.430> just

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
stumbling and that's basically just

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.899 
stumbling and that's basically just
dragging<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.959> fairly<00:03:48.530> dry<00:03:48.739> brush<00:03:49.069> so<00:03:49.370> across

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
dragging the fairly dry brush so across

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.300 
dragging the fairly dry brush so across
the<00:03:50.030> canvas<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.469> see<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.799> underlying

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
the canvas so you can see the underlying

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.759 
the canvas so you can see the underlying
color<00:03:52.639> underneath<00:03:52.969> and<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:54.500> why<00:03:54.709> these

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
color underneath and that's why these

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.670 
color underneath and that's why these
paints<00:03:55.280> are<00:03:55.370> really<00:03:55.730> good<00:03:55.909> for<00:03:56.060> doing<00:03:56.329> that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
paints are really good for doing that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.199 
paints are really good for doing that
okay<00:03:57.680> that's<00:03:57.889> how<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.040> leaf<00:03:58.310> done<00:03:58.639> you<00:03:58.909> can<00:03:59.060> see

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
okay that's how a leaf done you can see

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.119 
okay that's how a leaf done you can see
I<00:03:59.239> stumbled<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.959> little<00:04:00.109> bit<00:04:00.349> over<00:04:00.469> there<00:04:00.739> I'm
