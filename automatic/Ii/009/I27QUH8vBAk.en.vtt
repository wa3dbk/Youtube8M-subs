that's all the Juggalos are standing up
for<00:05:39.450> so<00:05:39.900> here<00:05:40.169> at<00:05:40.229> this<00:05:40.380> firm<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.740> mean<00:05:40.890> we

recognize his mainstream and corporates
as<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.940> firm<00:05:45.690> might<00:05:45.870> be<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.680> these<00:05:47.310> are<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
as a firm might be that these are the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.340 
as a firm might be that these are the
things<00:05:47.760> that<00:05:47.850> matter<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.150> all<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.450> us<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:48.840> so

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
we were happy to get involved and I

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.100 
we were happy to get involved and I
think<00:05:50.910> that's<00:05:51.270> how<00:05:51.419> it<00:05:51.510> impacts<00:05:51.810> everybody

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
think that's how it impacts everybody

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.560 
think that's how it impacts everybody
across<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.650> country<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.190> mean<00:05:53.700> folks<00:05:54.330> across

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
across the country I mean folks across

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.180 
across the country I mean folks across
the<00:05:54.780> country<00:05:54.810> value<00:05:55.320> these<00:05:55.470> very<00:05:55.680> same<00:05:55.890> rights

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
the country value these very same rights

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.430 
the country value these very same rights
and<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:57.150> these<00:05:57.300> are<00:05:57.450> ones<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.810> we<00:05:58.110> all<00:05:58.260> should

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
and so these are ones that we all should

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.170 
and so these are ones that we all should
be<00:05:58.470> excited<00:05:58.890> to<00:05:58.950> stand<00:05:59.160> up<00:05:59.280> for<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.700> I<00:06:00.120> would

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
be excited to stand up for and I would

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.700 
be excited to stand up for and I would
say<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.690> Juggalos<00:06:01.050> are<00:06:01.200> are<00:06:01.500> even

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
standing up for those very same rights

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.120 
standing up for those very same rights
of<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.330> FBI<00:06:03.660> officers<00:06:04.200> out<00:06:04.410> there<00:06:04.440> -<00:06:04.830> and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
of the FBI officers out there - and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.469 
of the FBI officers out there - and
they're<00:06:05.280> ones<00:06:05.430> are<00:06:05.550> important<00:06:05.850> to<00:06:05.910> each<00:06:06.000> of<00:06:06.150> us

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
they're ones are important to each of us

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.890 
they're ones are important to each of us
it<00:06:06.990> sure<00:06:07.229> does<00:06:07.440> have<00:06:07.680> much<00:06:07.890> more<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:08.910> should<00:06:09.780> say

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
it sure does have much more I should say

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.409 
it sure does have much more I should say
broader<00:06:10.229> implications<00:06:11.010> you<00:06:11.250> know<00:06:12.030> are<00:06:12.180> there

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
broader implications you know are there

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.810 
broader implications you know are there
any<00:06:12.690> other<00:06:12.960> instances<00:06:13.620> that<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.070> know<00:06:14.280> of<00:06:14.520> and

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
any other instances that you know of and

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.600 
any other instances that you know of and
which<00:06:15.150> people<00:06:15.510> are<00:06:15.930> targeted<00:06:16.560> or<00:06:17.010> designated

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
which people are targeted or designated

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.580 
which people are targeted or designated
as<00:06:17.729> members<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.510> gang<00:06:18.720> by<00:06:19.320> law

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
as members of the gang by law

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.890 
as members of the gang by law
enforcement<00:06:20.190> for<00:06:21.000> their<00:06:21.150> consumer<00:06:21.539> choices

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
enforcement for their consumer choices

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.409 
enforcement for their consumer choices
or<00:06:22.050> is<00:06:22.140> this<00:06:22.320> unique<00:06:23.750> well<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:26.090> suppose<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.300> way

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
or is this unique well I suppose the way

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.820 
or is this unique well I suppose the way
that<00:06:27.570> I<00:06:27.600> would<00:06:27.720> answer<00:06:27.780> that<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.380> say<00:06:28.560> that

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
that I would answer that is to say that

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.100 
that I would answer that is to say that
I<00:06:28.860> think<00:06:29.100> that<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.580> Department<00:06:29.970> of<00:06:30.000> Justice

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
I think that the Department of Justice

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.560 
I think that the Department of Justice
or<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.530> FBI<00:06:32.010> may<00:06:32.820> have<00:06:33.000> an<00:06:33.120> interest<00:06:33.390> in

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
or the FBI may have an interest in

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.330 
or the FBI may have an interest in
looking<00:06:33.720> at<00:06:34.080> some<00:06:34.110> sorts<00:06:34.830> of<00:06:34.890> groups<00:06:35.039> sort<00:06:35.250> of

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
looking at some sorts of groups sort of

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.100 
looking at some sorts of groups sort of
organized<00:06:35.849> around<00:06:36.090> things<00:06:36.479> like<00:06:36.570> gangster

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
organized around things like gangster

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.649 
organized around things like gangster
rap<00:06:37.289> sometimes<00:06:37.919> another<00:06:38.700> material<00:06:39.060> like<00:06:39.360> that

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
rap sometimes another material like that

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.239 
rap sometimes another material like that
but<00:06:40.470> I<00:06:40.500> think<00:06:40.890> this<00:06:41.070> is

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
but I think this is

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.859 
but I think this is
a developing<00:06:41.789> area<00:06:41.939> and<00:06:42.209> it's<00:06:42.299> probably<00:06:42.719> too

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:42.869 
a developing area and it's probably too

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.629 
a developing area and it's probably too
soon<00:06:42.899> to<00:06:43.229> tell<00:06:43.409> whether<00:06:43.769> or<00:06:44.249> not<00:06:44.369> that's

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
soon to tell whether or not that's

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.159 
soon to tell whether or not that's
really<00:06:44.789> something<00:06:45.239> that<00:06:45.389> where<00:06:45.689> people<00:06:45.959> have

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
really something that where people have

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.499 
really something that where people have
been<00:06:46.259> targeted<00:06:46.619> based<00:06:46.799> on<00:06:46.949> their<00:06:47.129> their<00:06:47.729> music

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
been targeted based on their their music

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.209 
been targeted based on their their music
choice<00:06:48.749> sure<00:06:49.109> and<00:06:49.379> from<00:06:49.619> what<00:06:49.829> you<00:06:49.949> know<00:06:50.189> I

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
choice sure and from what you know I

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.509 
choice sure and from what you know I
mean<00:06:50.579> has<00:06:50.759> a<00:06:50.789> lawsuit<00:06:51.359> ever<00:06:52.189> prompted<00:06:53.189> the<00:06:53.279> FBI

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:53.519 
mean has a lawsuit ever prompted the FBI

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:57.229 
mean has a lawsuit ever prompted the FBI
to<00:06:53.639> remove<00:06:54.149> a<00:06:54.329> gang<00:06:54.569> designation<00:06:55.789> well<00:06:56.789> these

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:57.239 
to remove a gang designation well these

00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:59.179 
to remove a gang designation well these
gang<00:06:57.449> designations<00:06:58.049> are<00:06:58.259> relatively<00:06:58.919> novel

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
gang designations are relatively novel

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:00.949 
gang designations are relatively novel
and<00:06:59.549> that<00:06:59.819> the<00:06:59.999> National<00:07:00.329> gang<00:07:00.479> Intelligence

and that the National gang Intelligence

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.569

I just brought together in 2006 after
some<00:07:07.439> action<00:07:07.859> by<00:07:07.949> Congress<00:07:08.309> in<00:07:08.399> 2005<00:07:09.059> so<00:07:09.359> there

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:09.749 
some action by Congress in 2005 so there

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:10.999 
some action by Congress in 2005 so there
really<00:07:09.899> hasn't<00:07:10.109> been<00:07:10.229> a<00:07:10.349> lawsuit<00:07:10.589> like<00:07:10.949> this

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009 
really hasn't been a lawsuit like this

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.389 
really hasn't been a lawsuit like this
this<00:07:11.969> will<00:07:12.089> be<00:07:12.149> the<00:07:12.239> first<00:07:12.509> time<00:07:12.719> but<00:07:13.219> we<00:07:14.219> think

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:14.399 
this will be the first time but we think

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.519 
this will be the first time but we think
that<00:07:14.489> in<00:07:14.849> terms<00:07:15.389> of<00:07:15.569> other<00:07:15.869> cases<00:07:16.199> in<00:07:16.439> other

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.529 
that in terms of other cases in other

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:18.289 
that in terms of other cases in other
areas<00:07:16.979> that<00:07:17.069> are<00:07:17.129> very<00:07:17.219> similar<00:07:17.639> to<00:07:17.789> this<00:07:18.089> that

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:18.299 
areas that are very similar to this that

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:20.479 
areas that are very similar to this that
we<00:07:19.110> at<00:07:19.229> least<00:07:19.379> have<00:07:19.619> some<00:07:19.829> very<00:07:20.009> strong<00:07:20.099> ground

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:20.489 
we at least have some very strong ground

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.189 
we at least have some very strong ground
to<00:07:20.610> go<00:07:20.729> on<00:07:20.879> well<00:07:21.209> it<00:07:21.299> seems<00:07:21.479> that<00:07:21.569> plaintiffs

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 
to go on well it seems that plaintiffs

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.679 
to go on well it seems that plaintiffs
certainly<00:07:22.559> have<00:07:22.709> a<00:07:22.739> very<00:07:23.039> strong<00:07:23.459> case<00:07:23.789> but

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:24.689 
certainly have a very strong case but

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.569 
certainly have a very strong case but
that's<00:07:24.839> all<00:07:24.959> we<00:07:25.049> have<00:07:25.199> time<00:07:25.379> for<00:07:25.439> Sora<00:07:26.129> ah<00:07:26.369> who

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:26.579 
that's all we have time for Sora ah who

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.149 
that's all we have time for Sora ah who
