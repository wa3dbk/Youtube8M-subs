00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.509
 something from that past that took more water 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.490
 or more and if you are aware if I want to know 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.969
 why does this still keep looking at this 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.070
 video I am 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.170
 lorena romero nutritionist and founder 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.760
 in aesthetic nutrition and in this video you 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.780
 I'm going to talk about what I call two 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.580
 types of thirst 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.500
 thirst is a basic mechanism of 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.120
 search for liquids resulting in the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.340
 act of drinking this is a mechanism 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.470
 fundamental that keeps the balance 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.870
 osmotic is to say the balance between 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.609
 thirst and liquids in the body thirst 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.899
 originates from a lack of 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.300
 liquids or an increase in 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.399
 concentration of certain or solitos are 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.769
 organic substances that participate in 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.229
 the regulation of osmolarity without 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.359
 alter cell functions and the 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.699
 osmolarity is the measurement used to 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.769
 express the total concentration such 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.800
 like the salt if the water volume of the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.629
 body falls below they are threshold or 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.940
 the concentration of the fireballs is 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.399
 too high the brain will send 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.379
 Signs of thirst to authors and others 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.300
 systems in the body that detect a 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.730
 decrease in fluid or an increase 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.230
 the osmotic concentration these send 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.960
 signals to the central nervous system 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.910
 where this information is processed these 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.710
 two types of thirst can receive several 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.780
 names but basically they differ 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.460
 so the first type is for 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380
 lack of water in the body the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.090
 concentration of solute minerals and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.430
 organic compounds of the body is 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.710
 too high and the liquid is necessary 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.050
 in order to dilute it and thus reach the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.970
 balance this type of thirst occurs when 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 we have consumed for example food 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 are drugs that are diuretics and we 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.420
 they make us urinate a lot or when we have passed 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.730
 many hours talking there is where we have 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.800
 lost water but we can replenish more 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.660
 easily taking a few glasses of 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.940
 water and so lime we go calmly 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.860
 our thirst the second type is when 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.420
 we have the right amount of water 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 but what we lack rather are 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.250
 soluutos that manifests itself when we take 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.990
 water and water and still we remain thirsty 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.370
 seemingly insatiable 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.290
 this happens for example when we have 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.360
 had excessive sweating or have we 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.040
 gone through a diarrheal process where 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.000
 in addition to but of the water we have lost 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.950
 a lot of electrolytes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.570
 in this situation as soon as we 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.820
 resort to drinks that are rich in 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.950
 solutes eye I do not mean to consume 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 artificial rehydration drinks but 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.640
 that we can resort to natural sources 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.440
 that help us rehydrate us without 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 However, it is very important to know that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.709
 own share signal is generated from 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.410
 the central nervous system 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.050
 specifically from the hypothalamus without 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.550
 matter what kind of being it is so 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.800
 this was my explanation about the two 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.840
 thirsty types I hope there really 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 been helpful you liked this video if it is 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.040
 So subscribe and share it with everyone 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.959
 your friends remember that you can also 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.270
 look for more information in our 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.310
 facebook twitter blogs interest of 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.980
 aesthetic nutrition and also in my new 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.720
 fanpage of nutritionist lorena romero 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.650
 thank you very much for watching this video and we 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.650
 we see in the next 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:02.670
 they are diuretics or when we have passed 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:05.420
 too much or in the act of drinking 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.420
 of our thirst
