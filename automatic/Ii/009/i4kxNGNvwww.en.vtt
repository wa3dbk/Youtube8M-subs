 When we administer a pesticide to large plants we must arm ourselves with suitable tools and pay attention to some details 

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:21.066
 When we administer a pesticide to large plants we must arm ourselves with suitable tools and pay attention to some details 

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:32.336
 First of all we need a sufficiently large nebulization pump, and with a jet sufficient to reach the entire crown of the tree 

00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:40.902
 To deliver the product we choose a windless day to avoid dispersing the product excessively in the environment 

00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:48.878
 otherwise it could go to harm the useful insects or even to people and objects that are near our plants 

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:57.648
 Then mix the most suitable pesticide, checking the dilution doses of the time that must elapse on the bottle label. 

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:05.797
 between two administrations and also how long we will have to wait before being able to collect and eat any fruits present on our plant 

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:16.445
 We vaporize the product on the whole plant, taking care to hit all the hair with the jet 

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:23.876
 and always keeping at a distance of at least 40-50 cm from the foliage or branches 

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:44.450
 We go over the plant a few times to make sure we spray the product all over the tree 

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:23.350
 if necessary, lift with a ladder or other support, so as to reach any particularly high or distant parts of the crown
