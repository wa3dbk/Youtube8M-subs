00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 in the first part this time the supply 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:15.910
 the 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 at the base of the spike 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.609
 or in the handlebar in this case we are breathing 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.369
 who has installed this form with two thin straps 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.550
 and on this amount the computation cycle the following way 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.060
 let's go through the court this nation 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.350
 of song 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.860
 sensor installed 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 in the lower bar of the bicycle scissors on the left side 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 it should be as follows down 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 not up because the delays on the bicycle may be that after 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 wants to find consensus 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 the magnet that complements the sensor 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 It is located in the following way with two gas belts on the inside 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.550
 nobody loves them 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.470
 trying to remove both and motorcycles millimeters distance between center 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.650
 lime 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.290
 otherwise 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.650
 not to register 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 the movement 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.620
 the sensor of adversity 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.460
 will be installed at any time 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.160
 boaco motive in front 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.200
 We have been 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.040
 explained that the instruction manual 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.510
 in the neighborhoods that fed up in the following way 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.410
 the sensor inwards 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.550
 the magnet located 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.550
 in the spokes of the wheel 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.710
 we will explain then 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 the wheel factor when we are ready one hundred 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.010
 that job 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.610
