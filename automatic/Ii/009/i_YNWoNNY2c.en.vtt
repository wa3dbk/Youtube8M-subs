00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.720
 formula mate 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.449

 president what are the conclusions 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.410
 of this day 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.559
 Well, we have stopped socialism 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.379
 21st century despite everything they have 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.020
 done despite having done all the 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.629
 fixes that could have done in spite 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.440
 of having the president now all 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.559
 the day with the town's television spot 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.829
 Salvadoran who pitifully did not vote 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.829
 massively but more or less 55 per 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.589
 hundred percent did not allow the fmln we will continue 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.049
 to a second period therefore to 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.820
 starting tomorrow we start 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.650
 fight to win the elections in 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.420
 March what will be the change of 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.010
 president strategy veiled because everything 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.170
 the world wonders where is it going to be 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.299
 sand today in this process that helps 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.729
 about a good meter right now 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.850
 we really have dedicated ourselves to this day 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.820
 more to the bus botting ballot boxes 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.380
 and tomorrow we have a meeting from the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 10 in the morning for the apra for 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.990
 rethink what we are going to do in this 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 second round we have a base 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.299
 now depending on how the figures are 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.909
 endings that will not vary much what 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.820
 we already know some things will be 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.009
 what to do but let's go forward 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.530
 adhesions of other formulas as joined 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.289
 with the other two small formulas that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 they also competed in this with others 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.939
 we make detailed a public invitation 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 to all the forces from right to all 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.810
 those people that what they want is 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 live in a country in peace and progress 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.850
 freedom poverty and freedom that join 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.709
 to the republic alliance effort 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.039
 republican nationalists and their candidate 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.039
