00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870

 21 year old reinders and has one 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 Dutch and a British passport with 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800

 last at the club of red green black 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 from gerard 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.579
 nec wants to close the season with points 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.870
 if only for the babel party 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 not to ruin 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.309
 the man who says goodbye to today 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 his Nijmegen audience's shot 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 amieux the first goal attempt of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.440
 match the Frenchman who so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.440
 also leaves 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 just ball possession for the team from waalwijk 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 that so far 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 carefree distribute joseph like that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 can by joseph son and babel shows on 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.260
 such for a l rkc and the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.309
 goal scorer is the man who makes his debut 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.309
 in the basis of that 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.190
 rkc is enough to defend 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.550
 nec 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.770
 nec early within seven minutes 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.750
 in arrears 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 as so often this season it is always 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.730
 twelfth time that nec within one 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 fifteen minutes a goal swallows the lucky one 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.250
 this time 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.250
 kenny anderson 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 the other way around that is feasible but at the bottom 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 great tackle two legs 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.700
 Clearly no drama can see it 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 through the fingers 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.840
 bon boys valkenburg to my 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.189
 rkc switching again 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 joseph says so well run 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.500
 thereby 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 reader and only misses the ball from he 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.829
 the not above mountain is in the hands of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.829
 sweet 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 valkenburg combination failed over name 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.099
 rkc let me go who will look him up late 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.459
 me it kick 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.459
 centimeter shield it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.829
 last 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.829
 and again there is room for rkc van peppe 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 Jozef son this is excellent movement 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.370
 from leader 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.389
 a great biblical rescue 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 well laid Jozef son comes there 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.370
 another chance for otherwise he would someday 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.370
 himself for that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.230
 front runs away from the ball 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.230
 so take over and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.129
 who ultimately wins next 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.610
 public 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.950
 after bad first half rse is now one 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.950
 chans the name of gabor babos 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.450
 then change is forthcoming for the lot 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.440
 man from hungary 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.940
 indeed here we go 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.940
 38 years 227 matches for nec 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.290
 much appreciated Poelman in Nijmegen 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.730
 He is replaced by goalkeeper Kalle 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.050
 johnsson 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.050
 the new goalkeeper of the coming season 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.200
 for this the audience came to it 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.410
 stadium 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.330
 waffles from under their own room 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.770
 wave end stage for suddenly one 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.440
 wanting to play football yet so far 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.400
 the first hour in the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.890
 direction of suffering but is sweet 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.290
 rather at the ball and then the space 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.510
 searched by Jozef son and what does 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.510
 johnson who let himself be fooled 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.580
 and that's it 2 0 for rkc 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.420
 4 Joseph's son in the audience and the 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.169
 players through the jeroen sweet 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.289
 assist 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.039
 from the departing goalkeeper 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.620
 great long ball then is under reports 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.780
 and johnson yes he has to get acquainted 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.710
 still with the Jozef son 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.710
 that is what happens with this 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.770
 roaster 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.759
 van peppen another will johnson 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.750
 leader 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.770
 leads to paul loss of peppers and 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.570
 Then George George George offside 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.760
 then the highlight is you from nec there 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.730
 one is leroy george 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.400
 substitute a little too enthusiastic for the 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.440
 purple from koolwijk 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.570
 Here you would say it is the same but 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.690
 we are not in line 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.690
 assistant referee is 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.490
 free kick 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.169
 van der Velden almost its own purpose 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.539
 worked just before sweet 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.539
 the header of van mussel field 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.070
 search may remain for the moment 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.400
 corner scholten 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:52.199
 then you must also fish the goal of kon 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.389
 nice two it 's for the statistics 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.310
 it's just a little sour for sweet 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.340
 he is about to change 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.340
 to become 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.220
 two beautiful years on a rental basis with rkc and 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.220
 then he is just beaten by coolboy 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.909
 it had to be a nice goodbye 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.309
 Babels from NEC eventually loses 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.229
 from rkc with two for the tenth time 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.349
 drive success pasture roads to he there 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.439
 cannot be won in the competition 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.069
 give you very bad feeling and 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:29.399
 at the same time 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.929
 yes someone in my position who needs to 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.679
 ensure that analyzes which must 

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:35.969
 also make sure he does the things that 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:37.679
 that can bring about a change 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.139
 or 

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:42.529
 that can bring about exchange 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.639
 so you have to keep working but 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.949
 and happy how you don't like it 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.979
 I have long played here two years 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.419
 banks so grateful for rkc and yes i think 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.039
 it also has been good to me 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.319
 that step and then make this year 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:59.819
 play a lot of games here 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:01.349
 and well now this around and then 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.269
 back to pc 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.999
 I hope the cooperation smell so 

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:07.679
 was really the top and now it's time 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:10.589
 to make room for the 

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:15.849
 future and I believe that have been seen 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:17.679
 the and is next to him the succession 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.179
 i am koeman how nice it is if you 

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:21.520
 let someone debut in the basics and that 

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:22.839
 scores under 7 minutes 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.800
 well we put boy in the 

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:29.080
 competition that does see quality 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.089
 it's a boy who has a lot of depth 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.439
 has a de pale also from that attack 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:33.699
 like a beautiful attack 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:35.949
 played great and where did it shoot him 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.490
 equally great inside so for him one 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.490
 dream debut
