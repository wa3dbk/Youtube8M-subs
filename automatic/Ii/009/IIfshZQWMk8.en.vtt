00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I 'm simon that's about the times today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 he 'll be afraid of the basic exercises 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.189
 again before that one just from 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.179
 cross-lifting and for squats 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.740
 mega respect maybe has 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 not the respect but also so 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.400
 a little bit the fear that you look 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 it hurts, of course, first of all 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 very important to distinguish between 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.430
 the fear that really is that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 so these bodily harms gm 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.180
 threaten and the mental fear it is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.160
 two completely different things though 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 Of course, that's why it's a broad one 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 So someone who is inhibited somewhere he is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 it will make you feel brain 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.759
 probably will not make a difference 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.469
 or will not be able to differentiate 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.000
 what is the fear that I am 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.620
 Imagine that I make myself 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.410
 what is the actual potential 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.700
 danger, the risk in these exercises the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 first of course you have to think 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600
 why are you actually doing this exercise 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.160
 trains both in powerlifting 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 Strength training in non- life in bodybuilding 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.449
 in the fitness area in the aerobic area in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 So many other sports even 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.510
 soccer player basketball player and so on 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.670
 continue to do the cross 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 kneeling, why are they going to be 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.969
 Exercises I'll tell you the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.440
 answer is quite simple because this exercise 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.969
 simply are extremely well 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 that is partly yes for millennia 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.990
 So these are these exercises 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 extremely old when the even visitors 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.619
 on the side of greece in ancient rome 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 These exercises are also traced back 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 with the movement sequences has even 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.330
 not even changed that much 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.799
 actually already extremely old that is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.000
 the whole thing is very abrupt the human being 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.799
 knows what he is doing and if you get it right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 makes and right at the point we are 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.549
 now with the technology if you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 the technology is right there you can 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.950
 Do not do anything wrong 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 that is exactly the point, of course 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.979
 really needs to know what you are doing 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 is not about the trade somehow 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 when cross lifting just up to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.560
 lift but it's all about the whole 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 to do it right and of course 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 even on his joints on his bones 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.159
 crave ribbons and consider 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.049
 is of course very important and it goes 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.100
 of course, the growth stimulus 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.659
 to put the muscle 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.189
 Now if we do these two exercises ourselves 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.479
 just once I look can you the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.189
 Unfortunately, I do not show it now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.200
 can show you that about so well 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.970
 Of course, when lifting it, it's clear 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.270
 is actually relatively little what you 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.979
 do you raise the bar and bring 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.299
 you just that position of course that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.439
 still just what the legs and 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.390
 hull work is concerned 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.009
 it's a little bit different of course 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.719
 very clear that this exercise too 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 may share in this maybe 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.420
 lower area of the tighten and then 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.730
 up here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.349
 that can be straightened, for example 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.970
 to divide down that is called one 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.980
 has the possibility of healing repetitions 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.330
 to make partial repetitions and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.730
 is there, of course, just what the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.989
 Muscle work is getting used to it 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.700
 That's the first tip in any case 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.440
 ever you can part repeats 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
 we can do the squats as well 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.040
 first a little squat 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.050
 go so small hofknicks do too 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.300
 first look how it actually works 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.650
 with the dumbbell bar on the on the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.150
 shoulder as it were, how does it feel? 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.640
 Actually without you right now 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 which makes short and he is too big and so 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.620
 continue 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.300
 So I advise you in any case 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 first a feeling for the exercises too 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.019
 get anti for the first time 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.120
 first rantasten without you 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.519
 now somehow complete now from a to 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680
 z equals the perfect sequence of movements 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.720
 one somehow sets him the goal anyway 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 At the beginning, it does not work out 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.209
 is of course just for those who 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.140
 give him a muscle training program 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.459
 are certainly a complete one now 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.319
 superfluous video because the all 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.600
 So tutorials get to every exercise 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.040
 a great tutorial with all the do's and don'ts 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.299
 dont's and so on and so forth 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
 So for this is natural now 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.080
 superfluous because they are the technology of mine 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 already explained from a to z, so to speak 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.299
 to get 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.739
 now it's just a few 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.060
 general tip maybe also around the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.650
 easy to defeat fear 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.870
 I honestly say that of course 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.519
 parts repetitions important but what 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.200
 even more important is that you have one 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.239
 upgraded condition to his 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.820
 basic exercises, that is first 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.980
 make warm up ten minutes 15 minutes 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.260
 For example , 20 minutes were doing here 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.370
 especially good on cardio equipment 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.049
 here's such a big truck 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.549
 Possibility also a bit poor 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.170
 and shoulder work so upper body 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.120
 to do something different than if 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.799
 you're just riding on the wheel where you are 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
 So only with the legs pedaling 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.310
 in total were doing and then still 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.320
 a very important thing to do before work 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.299
 always set a warm-up rate so 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.130
 especially with heavy exercises, I advise 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.260
 every case makes first use 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.239
 For the first time the brain muscle 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.140
 to reconnect connections again 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.150
 to activate 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.319
 So, so to speak, the second sentence 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.239
 only start fully 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.930
 also a very important thing about easy 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.849
 to this exercise 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.769
 To add a very important thing is 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.569
 Of course, this is still this mental 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.430
 this psychological barrier 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.349
 Of course I can not say where it is 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.879
 so I am now 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.099
 unfortunately not the gentleman she is now right now 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.380
 says anja you hurt you did you 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.880
 afraid there and therefore altogether let 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.549
 just tell you that not about you 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.900
 Of course, kneeling squat also raises all 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.120
 other exercises but just these 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.039
 specifically, exercises are easy 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.050
 The muscles also advance 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.699
 prepared for all the other things a 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.889
 trained body is going far 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.870
 less pain and these exercises are everything 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.830
 incentive dangerous it just comes easy 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.180
 on the technology 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.099
 and at the same time it does not work 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.419
 therefore somehow the most beautiful possible 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.310
 versions to make that works too 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.830
 not for the squats anyway 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.280
 with the buttocks down to the floor too 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.960
 come 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.150
 it is not about the cross lifting 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.919
 right now the 230 kilo to rip or 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.930
 something it's just about it 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.910
 first slowly to the government 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.960
 to get closer and then to increase 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.849
 watch if you at the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.009
 basic exercises increase find exactly in the 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.270
 areas ahead then works 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.259
 it also in the other muscle groups with 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.550
 the equipment exercises 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.770
 that means its, so to speak 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.210
 success driver how do you make progress and 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.010
 it is the right of way and then comes 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.590
 it's all down to see 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.419
 get started with the games we'll meet 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.419
 in the next video many greetings your simon
