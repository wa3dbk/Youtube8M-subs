00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.919
 that there are people welcome to all this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.509
 commented gameplay of gta san andreas and 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.490
 Well what I bring you today is a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 mission that I found on the internet and I said 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
 good because he does not bring it to the channel so 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 so let's load it right now I'm in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.029
 the menu 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.880
 of the mission that he clarified I did not do this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.460
 mission I found it on the internet and what 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.730
 that those who do not know what this 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.880
 what it does is that you can create 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 your mission and upload it upload the internet 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.190
 well this is called cover mod yo yes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.530
 done missions but never never never 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.370
 I've uploaded them, it's not all of it 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.530
 with the fans 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.989
 we'll see 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:51.750
 with obvious cheeses are enemies so 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:54.740
 red and a lot of balance 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740
 and a charger 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 to shoot him they are over 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.590
 how do you hold 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.610
 and they stayed to endure more 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.350
 I already played a toy first the mission and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.060
 no and moore and then then people because 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 because my intention was not to pass it because 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 He passed it and it will not be as joke 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.980
 yes I know if it is difficult not 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.530
 what I did this 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.570
 is to play it a little bit to see what if 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.020
 is overwhelmed or something was a mother of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.130
 this mission is a bastard up 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130
 so from here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.630
 laments as you say is not so 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 It is easy is difficult right now yes yes 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.650
 they killed me I think that here I think 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.650
 that was the one that killed me 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.479
 baldwin 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 no bullet mendizÃ¡bal mendizÃ¡bal 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160
 no one 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.400
 and here was where I died 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.040
 you do not notice the button 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.959
 sometimes 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.129
 ah 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.830
 and it does not do anything to me 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.170
 you have to apply 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.090
 to kill him why 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.090
 for not leaving you should not leave for more 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 to some 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 Hello 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.689
 ah 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.640
 this part of this index 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.799
 and it is already 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.150
 there is one less is no longer going to get to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.150
 nothing 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 9 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.880
 and here is another fact 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.150
 this is going to kill these facilities 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.420
 because they give us a 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.420
 in this a Saudi bullet 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.560
 and as I am facilitates 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.860
 and take good care of ourselves because in life that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.860
 I bring 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.110
 do not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.110
 and you will heal again 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.100
 well we are here in this part that was 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.230
 where I stayed is good because 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.480
 then to bring again the same thing they are 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.769
 It's going to be heavy and I already tried to bring a 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.769
 little and have a little more care 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.700
 I've been here for more days but do not kill me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.720
 but what I should have done is put 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.720
 an anti balance 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.600
 as of life 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.229
 ah 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.050
 ah 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.770
 I shot her I know her and ready 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.400
 there it is it brings a lot of life 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.539
 here 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.240
 we had 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.510
 a cat 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.510
 Y 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.670
 I had not seen a new guy battle 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:40.190
 bisbal that killed me so 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.190
 carefully with care and nothing else 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.360
 I assume that I do not have to download as much 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.360
 Probably not commit them I will help 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.010
 from where over here 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.010
 and so 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.920
 pat back expenses ideal 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.610
 ah 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.610
 dead 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:16.370
 then there is 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.370
 over here because here I feel something falling 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.250
 I have to rescue 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.400
 and I think if they follow me 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.400
 he does not want to fight 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:38.389
 because gypsy tells me mom not with that 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.389
 so easy so easy 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.059
 you have to give us 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.780
 no no no no this is not this is nothing to 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.120
