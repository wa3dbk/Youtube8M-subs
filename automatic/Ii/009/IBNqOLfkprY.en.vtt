00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
actually makes a very very good safe but

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.869 
actually makes a very very good safe but
they're<00:00:39.270> rather<00:00:39.390> expensive<00:00:39.600> um<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:41.460> looked<00:00:41.760> at

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they're rather expensive um I looked at

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
they're rather expensive um I looked at
Fort<00:00:42.149> Knox<00:00:42.329> which<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.020> another<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Fort Knox which is another really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
Fort Knox which is another really
expensive<00:00:44.309> safe<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.510> very

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
expensive safe but they make a very very

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.610 
expensive safe but they make a very very
good<00:00:46.110> safe<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.620> love<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> century<00:00:47.760> which

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
good safe i love this century which

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
good safe i love this century which
nothing<00:00:49.620> against<00:00:49.980> century<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.760> my

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
nothing against century but in my

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.510 
nothing against century but in my
opinion<00:00:51.289> they<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> best<00:00:53.039> safety

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
opinion they don't make the best safety

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
opinion they don't make the best safety
then<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.879> didn't<00:00:54.120> feel<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> actually

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
then they didn't feel when you actually

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
then they didn't feel when you actually
go<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> dealer<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.640> look<00:00:56.789> at

go there to the dealer and you look at
