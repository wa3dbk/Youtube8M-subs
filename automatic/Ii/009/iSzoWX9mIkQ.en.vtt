00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
joined together by stitching in the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.520 
joined together by stitching in the
ditch<00:02:03.950> between<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.880> panels<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.380> can

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
ditch between the panels here you can

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.020 
ditch between the panels here you can
see<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.979> stitching<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.489> the<00:02:07.610> ditch<00:02:07.640> is

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
see that the stitching in the ditch is

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.540 
see that the stitching in the ditch is
absolutely<00:02:08.539> perfect<00:02:08.989> on<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> outside

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
absolutely perfect on the outside

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.010 
absolutely perfect on the outside
however<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.060> underside<00:02:11.450> here<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.870> can

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
however on the underside here you can

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.740 
however on the underside here you can
see<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.470> seams<00:02:12.770> are<00:02:13.040> quite<00:02:13.459> Wiggly<00:02:14.150> now

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
see that the seams are quite Wiggly now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.360 
see that the seams are quite Wiggly now
some<00:02:15.260> people<00:02:15.380> might<00:02:15.650> say<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.190> is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
some people might say that this is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.920 
some people might say that this is
sloppy<00:02:16.580> work<00:02:16.970> while<00:02:17.300> other<00:02:17.480> people<00:02:17.660> will

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
sloppy work while other people will

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.870 
sloppy work while other people will
actually<00:02:18.500> say<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:19.280> makes<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.819> a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
actually say that this makes for a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.360 
actually say that this makes for a
stronger<00:02:20.270> corset<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.800> threads<00:02:22.220> are

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
stronger corset as the threads are

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.100 
stronger corset as the threads are
catching<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.090> fabric<00:02:23.420> itself<00:02:23.690> instead

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
catching on to the fabric itself instead

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.900 
catching on to the fabric itself instead
of<00:02:24.230> staying<00:02:24.470> purely<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.129> ditch<00:02:25.340> thus

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of staying purely in the ditch thus

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.150 
of staying purely in the ditch thus
making<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.290> stress<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.709> corset

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
making all the stress of the corset

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.890 
making all the stress of the corset
dependent<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.000> strength<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.510> threads

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
dependent on the strength of the threads

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.979 
dependent on the strength of the threads
so<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.819> see<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.300> lining<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.780> not

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
so you can see that the lining is not

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.780 
so you can see that the lining is not
floating<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.890> boning<00:02:34.280> channels<00:02:34.640> are

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
floating the boning channels are

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
floating the boning channels are
actually<00:02:35.330> sewn<00:02:35.660> right<00:02:35.690> through<00:02:36.350> all<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
layers of the corset and the bones are

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.360 
layers of the corset and the bones are
sandwiched<00:02:39.440> between<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.100> two

layers of twill the interlining and the
lining<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.040> here<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.120> may<00:02:44.299> be<00:02:44.330> able<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:45.049> a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
very faint outline of the waist tape

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.899 
very faint outline of the waist tape
it's<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.530> 1<00:02:48.709> inch<00:02:48.920> wide<00:02:49.159> total<00:02:49.549> tape<00:02:49.730> between

the lining and interlining invisibly
stitched<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.769> binding<00:02:55.129> at<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> top

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
stitched here so the binding at the top

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.339 
stitched here so the binding at the top
and<00:02:55.670> bottom<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:56.060> made<00:02:56.209> out<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.599> black<00:02:56.810> bias

tape<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.940> machine<00:02:59.299> stitched<00:02:59.810> on<00:03:00.049> both

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
tape that is machine stitched on both

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.410 
tape that is machine stitched on both
sides<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:01.190> small<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> outside<00:03:01.790> here

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
sides it's small on the outside here

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.789 
sides it's small on the outside here
which<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:02.690> think<00:03:02.870> looks<00:03:03.049> really<00:03:03.140> nice<00:03:03.500> with<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
which I think looks really nice with the

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.430 
which I think looks really nice with the
corset<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.400> then<00:03:05.000> it's<00:03:05.450> folded<00:03:05.930> under<00:03:06.230> and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
corset and then it's folded under and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.740 
corset and then it's folded under and
machine<00:03:06.769> stitched<00:03:07.129> to<00:03:07.849> catch<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.299> on<00:03:08.480> the

machine stitched to catch it on the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
underside as well you can see that on

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990 
underside as well you can see that on
the<00:03:12.650> second<00:03:12.980> machine<00:03:13.220> stitching<00:03:13.489> they<00:03:13.730> put<00:03:13.910> it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the second machine stitching they put it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.940 
the second machine stitching they put it
right<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.420> ditch<00:03:14.629> between<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.739> bias

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
right in the ditch between the bias
