00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.429
 speaks, folks what raul and we 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 make another video from our series 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.389
 blowing the head and this time talking 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.889
 one of the largest franchises in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.540
 history of video games want to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.000
 the biggest franchise in the history of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.680
 nintendo the next but do not know the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 plumber who lead a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.640
 of the most successful series in the world 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 of games with more than 200 games released 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 today it is even really see the mÃ¡rio 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 is arguably the most 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 successful ever type of nintendo and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 maybe the world of games and still today 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.260
 coming across generations and making 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.129
 much success with the various types of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 gamers 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 however you knew that it only came 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.149
 because another famous character can not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 to be part of the donkey kong game due to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.649
 copyright and such seven he has been 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.480
 kind of done last minute is on 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.100
 it was plan b of the island 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 the company that forced it to create a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 supporting character for the game of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.840
 wing because it failed to release 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.000
 jackson five the game is well that's it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.739
 could not have arisen if the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 company obtained the copyright 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 to use the parent 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.710
 moreover at the time the nintendo 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.049
 thought and imagined using the plumber 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 mustache with the main character of the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.560
 game if I am a consequence as not 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 Can we use the father? 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.759
 they then decided to invent another 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 character instead of forcing sailor 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.570
 wanted to save olitia toothpick solved 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.909
 put the director until then 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 unknown to save a princess 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.689
 but they did not have the courage to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 play the game 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.189
 the plumber who was on top of it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 So they decided to change the focus 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.900
 from the game to the villain king kong mario 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.020
 Her name was not Maria, she was just called 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.329
 or something like a man who jumps 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.880
 the fact of putting forth - or 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 As you prefer how huge a mustache is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 because Nintendo does not have the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 technology to put the mouth of the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.799
 character because the game would be very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.840
 heavy then put a giant pixel 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.640
 which mimicked a mustache and so the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 our beloved princess savior 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.250
 Italian plumber and mustachioed mario 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.300
