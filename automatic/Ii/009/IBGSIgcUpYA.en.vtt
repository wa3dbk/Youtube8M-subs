little bit longer some people like it a
little<00:02:44.440> more<00:02:44.590> watery<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.690> also<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.350> keep

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
little more watery so but also to keep

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
little more watery so but also to keep
in<00:02:47.680> mind<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.280> potatoes<00:02:48.819> they<00:02:49.030> are<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.390> to
