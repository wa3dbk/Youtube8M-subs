this<00:01:53.790> site<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.720> basically<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this site and so they have basically a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.539 
this site and so they have basically a
couple<00:01:55.740> different<00:01:56.009> ways<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
couple different ways you can do this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.819 
couple different ways you can do this

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you can download an HTML file and then

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
you can download an HTML file and then
upload<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.579> server<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.299> click

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
upload it to your server you can click

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.319 
upload it to your server you can click
alternate<00:02:01.229> methods<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.939> verify<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.000> by

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
alternate methods and verify it by

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:03.720 
alternate methods and verify it by
adding

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
adding

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you're good with code I don't like doing

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.200 
you're good with code I don't like doing
that<00:02:08.080> if<00:02:08.290> you're<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.640> premade<00:02:09.640> template<00:02:10.090> or

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
that if you're on a premade template or

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.940 
that if you're on a premade template or
something<00:02:10.570> because<00:02:10.720> if<00:02:11.020> they<00:02:11.170> update<00:02:11.770> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
something because if they update the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.560 
something because if they update the
template<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.490> download<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:12.940> update<00:02:13.300> this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
template you download the update this

when you download the update so you'll

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.320

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
some problems later you can verify it by

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.200 
some problems later you can verify it by
