00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.830 

now<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.710> good<00:00:25.859> thing<00:00:25.919> about<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.970> it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
now the good thing about this is that it

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.960 
now the good thing about this is that it
is<00:00:28.429> pretty<00:00:29.429> cheap<00:00:30.140> compared<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.890> know

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
is pretty cheap compared to you know

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.040 
is pretty cheap compared to you know
quoz<00:00:32.970> from<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.570> mall<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.460> pretty<00:00:36.050> powdery

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
quoz from the mall it is pretty powdery

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.069 
quoz from the mall it is pretty powdery
I<00:00:37.879> mean<00:00:38.879> that's<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> only<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.660> could<00:00:39.719> say

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I mean that's the only thing I could say

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.649 
I mean that's the only thing I could say
that's<00:00:40.260> probably<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.949> downfall<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
that's probably the downfall it is

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.740 
that's probably the downfall it is
pigmented<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.850> statement<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
pigmented but not a statement it as I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950 
pigmented but not a statement it as I
wish<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.059> colors<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.540> not

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
wish it was because the colors are not

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
wish it was because the colors are not
that<00:00:49.170> true<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.949> this<00:00:50.220> palette<00:00:50.790> but<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.479> do

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that true in this palette but if you do

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
that true in this palette but if you do
pack<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.250> colored<00:00:53.729> base

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pack it on and use like a colored base

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360 
pack it on and use like a colored base
you<00:00:54.780> probably<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> better<00:00:56.129> effect

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you probably would get a better effect

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.640 
you probably would get a better effect
now<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.570> video<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.439> only<00:00:58.769> using<00:00:59.119> milk
