it's<00:02:53.710> more<00:02:54.310> likely<00:02:54.550> draw<00:02:54.880> but<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:55.840> he<00:02:56.020> would

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's more likely draw but if he would

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.770 
it's more likely draw but if he would
continue<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.740> put<00:02:57.670> pressure<00:02:57.700> positional<00:02:58.630> to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
games now three games left nervous will

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.950 
games now three games left nervous will
decide<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> lot<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.070> we<00:03:33.460> will<00:03:33.610> see<00:03:33.820> if<00:03:34.330> we<00:03:34.810> will

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
decide a lot so we will see if we will

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.060 
decide a lot so we will see if we will
see<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:35.980> fabric<00:03:36.490> it's<00:03:36.820> very<00:03:37.090> hard<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.420> predict

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
see in fabric it's very hard to predict

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.460 
see in fabric it's very hard to predict
Alicia<00:03:39.070> maybe<00:03:39.340> slight<00:03:39.670> favorite<00:03:40.060> but<00:03:40.300> it's

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
Alicia maybe slight favorite but it's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.450 
Alicia maybe slight favorite but it's
when<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.250> much<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.640> stake<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:44.170> nerves<00:03:44.890> again

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
when so much on stake it's nerves again

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.240 
when so much on stake it's nerves again
you'll<00:03:45.670> decide<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.030> lot<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> probably<00:03:48.100> she

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
you'll decide a lot so probably she

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.320 
you'll decide a lot so probably she
would<00:03:48.610> be<00:03:48.760> favorite<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:49.900> tiebreak<00:03:50.380> but<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:51.790> be

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
would be favorite in tiebreak but not be

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.790 
would be favorite in tiebreak but not be
not<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.570> big<00:03:52.810> favorite<00:03:53.140> let's<00:03:53.410> say<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:53.740> my

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
not a big favorite let's say in my

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.010
