we have a 2.4 liter 4-cylinder with
variable<00:00:51.500> valve<00:00:51.530> timing<00:00:51.890> let's<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.850> motor

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
variable valve timing let's the motor

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.880 
variable valve timing let's the motor
breathe<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.510> way<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:53.809> supposed<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:54.800> have

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
breathe the way it's supposed to we have

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.500 
breathe the way it's supposed to we have
it<00:00:55.010> paired<00:00:55.280> with<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.519> continuous<00:00:56.210> variable

it paired with a continuous variable
transaxle<00:00:57.379> -<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.339> you'll<00:00:58.460> never<00:00:58.699> feel<00:00:58.969> the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
transaxle - so you'll never feel the

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.450 
transaxle - so you'll never feel the
shift<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.570> you're<00:00:59.719> actually<00:00:59.870> gonna<00:01:00.109> get

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
shift and you're actually gonna get

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.639 
shift and you're actually gonna get
optimal<00:01:01.460> fuel<00:01:01.699> mileage<00:01:01.820> at<00:01:02.089> all<00:01:02.210> times<00:01:02.499> now<00:01:03.499> as

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.020 
handle here what that does it actually
allows<00:03:29.709> us<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:30.010> adjust<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.550> height<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
allows us to adjust the height of the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.150 
allows us to adjust the height of the
seat<00:03:31.270> so<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:32.170> husband<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.709> wife<00:03:32.800> are<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> little

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
seat so a husband and wife are a little

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.980 
seat so a husband and wife are a little
bit<00:03:33.340> taller<00:03:33.610> or<00:03:33.820> shorter<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.330> can<00:03:34.660> actually

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
bit taller or shorter you can actually

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.510 
bit taller or shorter you can actually
bring<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.320> right<00:03:35.470> up<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.950> everyone<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.459> see

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
bring it right up so everyone can see

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.840 
bring it right up so everyone can see
how<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.900> over<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.020> dash<00:03:38.200> very<00:03:38.500> easily<00:03:38.850> we've

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
how to over the dash very easily we've

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.340 
how to over the dash very easily we've
mounted<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.240> radio<00:03:40.540> controls<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.200> back

mounted the radio controls in the back

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.010

of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> steering<00:03:41.830> wheel<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.600> never<00:03:43.840> have

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
of the steering wheel so you never have

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.300 
of the steering wheel so you never have
to<00:03:44.080> take<00:03:44.140> your<00:03:44.290> hands<00:03:44.470> off<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> wheel<00:03:44.770> change

a<00:03:47.380> position<00:03:47.560> where<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.040> could<00:03:48.220> wreck<00:03:48.490> with

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
a position where you could wreck with

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.870 
a position where you could wreck with
the<00:03:49.840> continuous<00:03:50.530> variable<00:03:50.950> trains<00:03:51.220> axle<00:03:51.640> two

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
the continuous variable trains axle two

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.210 
the continuous variable trains axle two
