if you go off-roading or own an RV you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
if you go off-roading or own an RV you
know<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.560> constant<00:00:20.070> tire<00:00:20.220> pressure<00:00:20.550> changes

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

the<00:01:21.420> vehicle<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.440> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.679> do<00:01:22.800> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the vehicle so all you have to do is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
the vehicle so all you have to do is
turn<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.220> any<00:01:23.580> air<00:01:23.759> supply<00:01:24.179> in<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> case

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
turn on any air supply in this case

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.130 
turn on any air supply in this case
we're<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> turn<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.649> air<00:01:25.860> supply

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080 

okay<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.190> hear<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.520> noise<00:01:32.580> right

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
okay when you hear that noise right

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.960 
okay when you hear that noise right
there<00:01:33.150> that's<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.280> tire<00:01:35.280> pressure<00:01:35.610> set

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there that's this tire pressure set

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.990 
there that's this tire pressure set
point<00:01:36.000> valve<00:01:36.480> is<00:01:37.050> reached<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.770> set<00:01:38.070> point<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
point valve is reached at set point so

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
point valve is reached at set point so
anytime<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.840> comes<00:01:40.080> up<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.800> pressure

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
anytime it comes up over that pressure

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.280 
anytime it comes up over that pressure
it<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:41.880> release<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.480> pressure<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it will release that pressure and just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.070 
it will release that pressure and just
hold<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.370> see<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.150> gauge<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
hold it if you see here on our gauge you

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.750 
hold it if you see here on our gauge you
can<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.650> it's<00:01:46.770> doing<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> comes<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
can see what it's doing it comes up to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.450 
can see what it's doing it comes up to
30<00:01:48.090> psi<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.050> then<00:01:49.410> bleeds<00:01:49.710> off<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:50.310> bit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
30 psi and then bleeds off a little bit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
30 psi and then bleeds off a little bit
of<00:01:50.550> excess<00:01:50.910> pressure<00:01:51.120> so<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> doesn't<00:01:51.870> go<00:01:51.960> over

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
of excess pressure so it doesn't go over

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.010 
of excess pressure so it doesn't go over
that<00:01:52.260> pressure
