the band is quite comfortable to run
with<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.510> an<00:01:12.689> adjustable<00:01:12.990> band<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.920> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
with it has an adjustable band so you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.859 
with it has an adjustable band so you
can<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> band<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.939> snug<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.630> wrist

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
can make the band be snug on your wrist

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
can make the band be snug on your wrist
four<00:01:16.140> runs<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.880> since<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.150> GPS<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.049> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
four runs and since it has GPS you can

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
four runs and since it has GPS you can
leave<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.530> phone<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.799> home<00:01:20.780> however<00:01:21.780> using

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
leave your phone at home however using

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.640 
leave your phone at home however using
GPS<00:01:22.799> drains<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> battery<00:01:23.549> quite<00:01:24.150> quickly

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
GPS drains the battery quite quickly

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
GPS drains the battery quite quickly
expect<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> only<00:01:26.130> four<00:01:26.520> hours<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> GPS

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
expect to get only four hours of GPS

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
expect to get only four hours of GPS
tracking<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.650> better<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.400> pace

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
tracking so you better on a good pace

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
tracking so you better on a good pace
for<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.000> marathon<00:01:30.560> but<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.799> most<00:01:31.920> people<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
for that marathon but for most people is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.830 
for that marathon but for most people is
running<00:01:32.670> adventures<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> battery<00:01:33.659> life

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
running adventures the battery life

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.289 
running adventures the battery life
should<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.229> sufficient<00:01:35.119> activities<00:01:36.119> like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
should be sufficient activities like

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
should be sufficient activities like
hiking<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.810> mountain<00:01:37.140> biking<00:01:37.170> however<00:01:37.979> will

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
hiking and mountain biking however will

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.539 
hiking and mountain biking however will
likely<00:01:38.759> drain<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> band's<00:01:39.630> battery<00:01:40.369> if<00:01:41.369> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
likely drain the band's battery if you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
likely drain the band's battery if you
don't<00:01:41.729> use<00:01:41.850> GPS<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.079> 48<00:01:43.619> hours

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
