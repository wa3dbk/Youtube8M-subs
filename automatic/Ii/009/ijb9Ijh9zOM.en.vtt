second<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.330> front<00:00:06.629> tires<00:00:06.960> put<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.200> tomorrow

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
second in front tires put on tomorrow

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.360 
second in front tires put on tomorrow
because<00:00:09.530> fronts<00:00:10.530> pretty<00:00:10.769> much<00:00:10.920> down<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
because fronts pretty much down to the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.970 
because fronts pretty much down to the
belts<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.330> inside<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.500> falling<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
belts on the inside and falling on the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.099 
belts on the inside and falling on the
outside<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> don't<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.480> straps<00:00:15.809> being

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
outside I don't think the straps being

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.680 
outside I don't think the straps being
put<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> properly<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.690> structure

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
put in properly because the structure

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
put in properly because the structure
ops<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.350> three<00:00:19.650> positions<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> I've

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
ops can go in three positions so I've

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.630 
ops can go in three positions so I've
bit<00:00:21.210> too<00:00:21.359> much<00:00:21.510> negative<00:00:21.960> camber<00:00:22.550> but<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
bit too much negative camber but the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.890 
bit too much negative camber but the
cloth<00:00:23.820> built<00:00:24.119> starting<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> show<00:00:24.689> through

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
is do I just basically cuddle these

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
is do I just basically cuddle these
copper<00:01:06.840> lines<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.310> throw<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
copper lines off and throw them in a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
copper lines off and throw them in a
bucket<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.080> basically<00:01:10.560> Chuck<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
compressor in the scrap steal the ball

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
compressor in the scrap steal the ball
and<00:01:15.049> leave<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> radiator<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.400> best<00:01:17.610> off

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and leave the radiator and my best off

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.560 
and leave the radiator and my best off
just<00:01:19.040> cutting<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.189> ends<00:01:20.430> off<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.970> tucking

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
them into copper bucket and catching the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.510 
them into copper bucket and catching the
radiator<00:01:23.670> Enders<00:01:24.090> radiator<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:25.369> once<00:01:26.369> I've

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
radiator Enders radiator or once I've

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.130 
radiator Enders radiator or once I've
cut<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> ends<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.060> peeling<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.659> these<00:01:27.840> off

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cut the ends off peeling all these off

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
cut the ends off peeling all these off
because<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.500> listener<00:01:29.329> pulled<00:01:30.329> back<00:01:30.540> fairly

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
because a listener pulled back fairly

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.389 
because a listener pulled back fairly
easily

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
air conditioner itself I don't know much

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.260 
air conditioner itself I don't know much
about<00:01:35.979> them<00:01:36.399> doesn't<00:01:37.359> have<00:01:37.420> any<00:01:37.570> gas<00:01:37.750> in<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:39.270> as
