00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
got me killed that little fraction of a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
got me killed that little fraction of a
second<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.000> takes<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> tap

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
second it takes to actually do that tap

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
second it takes to actually do that tap
I<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:17.189> enemy<00:01:17.460> hitting<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> corner<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I get enemy hitting the corner and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.710 
I get enemy hitting the corner and
shooting<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.610> battlefield<00:01:20.610> 3<00:01:20.720> he

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
shooting me down in battlefield 3 he

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
shooting me down in battlefield 3 he
doesn't<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> tap<00:01:22.350> animation<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.070> it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
doesn't do the tap animation i know it's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.770 
doesn't do the tap animation i know it's
realistic<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.150> tap<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> weapon

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
realistic to actually tap the weapon

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
realistic to actually tap the weapon
they<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.170> real<00:01:25.380> life<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.939> it's<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they do in real life but it's just a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
they do in real life but it's just a
game<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.570> prefer<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> doesn't<00:01:28.619> because

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
game I I prefer that it doesn't because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
game I I prefer that it doesn't because
it'll<00:01:29.430> save<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.060> reloading<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> guns<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it'll save time on reloading the guns in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.340 
it'll save time on reloading the guns in
battlefield<00:01:33.750> bad<00:01:33.930> company<00:01:34.110> 2<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:36.270> me<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.270 
battlefield bad company 2 are to me the
way<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.530> look<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.810> bit<00:01:40.439> better

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
way they look are a bit a bit better

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
way they look are a bit a bit better
than<00:01:41.579> battlefield<00:01:42.090> 3<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> their

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
than battlefield 3 because of their

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.499 
than battlefield 3 because of their
bulkiness<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.729> guns<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.360> look

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
bulkiness I like I like guns they look

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
bulkiness I like I like guns they look
like<00:01:45.600> they're<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.590> some<00:01:46.770> weight<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like they're they have some weight to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
OGG and I it actually looks bulkier than

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
OGG and I it actually looks bulkier than
some<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> weapons<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.380> battlefield<00:01:52.890> 3<00:01:52.920> and

detection<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.420> battlefield<00:03:11.840> bad<00:03:12.020> company<00:03:12.200> 2

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
detection and battlefield bad company 2

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.370 
detection and battlefield bad company 2
is<00:03:12.860> worse<00:03:13.370> than<00:03:13.730> battlefield<00:03:14.390> 3<00:03:14.660> there's

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
is worse than battlefield 3 there's

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.410 
is worse than battlefield 3 there's
times<00:03:15.680> where<00:03:15.950> I'm<00:03:16.100> aiming<00:03:16.370> at<00:03:16.610> someone<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.269> I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
won't get a hit detection and so maybe

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.600 
won't get a hit detection and so maybe
four<00:03:19.340> bullets<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:20.980> after<00:03:21.980> my<00:03:22.070> fourth<00:03:22.340> round

fine<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:49.070> one<00:03:49.280> thing<00:03:49.459> they<00:03:49.670> they<00:03:50.420> should<00:03:50.450> have

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
fine the one thing they they should have

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.030 
fine the one thing they they should have
done<00:03:51.019> is<00:03:51.940> gave<00:03:52.940> us<00:03:53.150> some<00:03:53.420> better<00:03:53.750> cover<00:03:54.709> in

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
done is gave us some better cover in

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
a lot of cover anyway but just the fact

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.320 
a lot of cover anyway but just the fact
that<00:03:59.630> when<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.900> on<00:04:00.110> crouch<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:02.090> crouch

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
that when you on crouch and you crouch

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.150 
that when you on crouch and you crouch

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
green animation is better the way he

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.659 
green animation is better the way he
tosses<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.919> lot<00:04:25.070> cooler<00:04:25.250> looks<00:04:25.550> like

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
tosses it it's a lot cooler looks like

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.680 
tosses it it's a lot cooler looks like
he<00:04:25.820> actually<00:04:25.970> putting

battlefield bad company 2 it seems

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.140 
battlefield bad company 2 it seems
almost<00:04:42.980> like<00:04:43.130> there's<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.700> little<00:04:43.820> bit<00:04:43.970> less

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
almost like there's a little bit less

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.050 
almost like there's a little bit less
gravity<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.010> grenade<00:04:46.280> actually<00:04:46.610> floats

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
gravity so the grenade actually floats

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.180
