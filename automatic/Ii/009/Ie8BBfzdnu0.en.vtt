they<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> will<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.140> four<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> one

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
they take this and will be four to one

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.750 
they take this and will be four to one
but<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:01.980> start<00:01:02.129> building<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> little

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
but they can start building up a little

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
but they can start building up a little
momentum<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:04.140> take<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> route<00:01:04.650> up

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
momentum and now they take that route up

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.710 
momentum and now they take that route up
to<00:01:04.890> 5<00:01:05.010> 25<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.030> building<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.479> bit<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to 5 25 so building a little bit of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
to 5 25 so building a little bit of
momentum<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.619> staying<00:01:07.920> even<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.430> our

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
momentum back but staying even with our

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
momentum back but staying even with our
terrorist<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:09.060> rounds<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:09.930> for

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
