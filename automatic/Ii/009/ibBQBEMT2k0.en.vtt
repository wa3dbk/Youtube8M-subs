00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 here we have the fabas directly 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.799
 from asturias that have rested in water 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 cold all night long we drained the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.900
 water and we put the fabas back into the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.060
 same pot 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.140
 the compound composed of chorizo 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.509
 blood sausage lacón and bacon 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.170
 we throw the bacon along with the fabas and 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.170
 a splash of oil 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.250
 we throw better bottled water until 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.880
 surpass a finger of the fabas we put a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.880
 medium-high fire 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.579
 in another pot with water we put the chorizo 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.470
 and the blood sausage to boil for 10 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.420
 minutes to defat the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.410
 in a hunting part we know the lacón 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 for another 10 minutes 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.950
 meanwhile we pricked a quarter of 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.950
 onion 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 ah 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.399
 before it breaks to boil the fabas of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.399
 foam mos 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.980
 After 10 minutes we took the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980
 sausage 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.290
 you see all the fat that you have released 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.820
 in a pan we throw two tablespoons 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.270
 tureens of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.270
 and fry the onion 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.700
 we speak lightly 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.439
 it's been 20 minutes now it's time 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.729
 to remove from heat let stand 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.729
 for 5 minutes 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.240
 we already have the sofrito onion we add 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.950
 the paprika and we remove a lot of care from 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.280
 Do not burn the paprika, otherwise 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.930
 It makes us bitter of the stew 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.180
 we cast it together with the fabas 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.450
 we incorporate the saffron soaked in a 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.280
 little water 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 we add the chorizo ​​sausage and the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.220
 lacón and cover with water again 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.220
 bottled up 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.390
 cook over medium heat for 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.390
 90 minutes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 we want to smoke, we have to have the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.850
 caution that they are always 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.850
 broth covers 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.720
 during the 90 minutes we add one or 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.140
 twice cold water to break the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.140
 cooking 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.800
 we take the compango now if you want to be 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 Exquisite broth pass for a raisin 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.180
 for a few flaws and we add them to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.660
 broth at home we like the broth more 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660
 light 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.319
 We serve the fabas in a tureen and the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.299
 compango sliced in a separate source 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.489
 a typical Asturian dish ideal for 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.799
 cold days in this case I followed the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.579
 gerardo house recipe but as in everything 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.579
 there are more variants
