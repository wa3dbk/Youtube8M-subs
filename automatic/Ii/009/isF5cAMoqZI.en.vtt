00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 is looking for a fresh flavor for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 Brighten up your day because you do not add some 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 fresh ingredients to your formula shake 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.380
 1 let life 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 I am your amber mendia tease is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.670
 registered and you probably know 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 that I love playing in the kitchen and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.869
 make new smoothie recipes so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.900
 today I'm going to make an apple vision 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.689
 fresh fresh ginger and fresh lemon 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.810
 I will show you how to do it I have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 the blender 8 ounces 250 milliliters of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.399
 low fat milk you can use 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.140
 soy milk if you prefer I have 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.600
 put some ice cubes in mine 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 just to express my shake a little 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 I will also now add my formula 1 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.460
 I have 2 tablespoons of vanilla rum 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.379
 formula 16 mix and that will form the basis 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 for my shake now for the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.789
 fresh ingredients I will use a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.190
 apple pink lady this is an apple 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 Sweet can use an area if you want 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.390
 but I think the candy works a little 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.699
 better I will use approximately the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 half an apple so I 'm just going 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 to cut in half I'm going to take the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
 center and I'm just going to cut in a couple of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.900
 big pieces and put that apple 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.800
 cool 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.800
 in my blender 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 the other thing that I am going to add is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
 approximately 4 teaspoons of juice 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.460
 of fresh lemon I'm going to add a pinch 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.460
 of fresh lemon peel or zest 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.630
 and then the last thing I'm going to 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.939
 adding is the fresh ginger root 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.460
 I just scratch so I'll take 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.079
 a large piece of fresh ginger gave me 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 an idea because I recently had a 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.939
 Ginger lemonade and it tasted delicious 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.939
 now we're just going to beat 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.280
 I think we're part of the reason 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.320
 why I came up with an idea of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.539
 this is because the juice bars are 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.609
 they are becoming very popular but 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.170
 when you get a fresh juice you 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.060
 will not usually get the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.590
 fiber that is in the fruit and the other 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.629
 thing is that most of them do not 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.760
 they have the protein so from this 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.069
 way we'll get a little bit of the mix 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.069
 of the best of both worlds so of 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.549
 new it 's light it's refreshing I put it 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.970
 that apple and lemon and ginger 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.970
 good profit
