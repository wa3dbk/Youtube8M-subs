00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
have to worry about that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.399 
have to worry about that
so<00:01:25.680> jab<00:01:26.670> step<00:01:26.970> change<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> direction<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

the<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.560> thing<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.770> an<00:01:32.040> offensive<00:01:32.369> player

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the good thing about an offensive player

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.380 
the good thing about an offensive player
is<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.380> able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.710> both<00:01:35.189> ways

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
is you got to be able to go both ways

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
is you got to be able to go both ways
you<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:38.040> limiting<00:01:38.400> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you go one way now you're limiting your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670 
you go one way now you're limiting your
options<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.600> defense<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.140> gonna<00:01:40.200> read<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
options the defense is gonna read that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.840 
options the defense is gonna read that
and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.820> become<00:01:42.229> more<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:44.640> have

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and then they become more I guess have

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
and then they become more I guess have
the<00:01:45.000> advantage<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.840> try<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> limit<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the advantage to try to limit your

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
the advantage to try to limit your
options<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.310> an<00:01:47.460> options<00:01:47.790> player<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.720> never

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
options as an options player you never

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
options as an options player you never
want<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> limit<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.619> option<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.939> you're

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
want to limit your option so when you're

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.109 
want to limit your option so when you're
working<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> move<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.320> way

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
working on that move to do it this way

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.080 
working on that move to do it this way
also<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.060> have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
also do it that way so now you can have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.260 
also do it that way so now you can have
two<00:01:57.390> options<00:01:58.399> if<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.640> man<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> taking<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
two options if my man is taking a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
two options if my man is taking a
defensive<00:02:00.450> stance<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.530> thing<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> I'm

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
defensive stance the thing that I'm

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
defensive stance the thing that I'm
looking<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> he's<00:02:03.149> playing

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.929 
looking at right now is he's playing
parallel<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.920> he's<00:02:05.310> playing<00:02:05.549> me<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> go

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
parallel so now he's playing me to go

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.660 
parallel so now he's playing me to go
either<00:02:06.119> way<00:02:06.240> which<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:07.160> which<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> also

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
either way which is good which and also

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.930 
either way which is good which and also
to<00:02:09.209> me<00:02:09.360> means<00:02:10.069> all<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.730> give<00:02:11.879> him

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to me means all I have to do is give him

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.540 
to me means all I have to do is give him
a<00:02:12.000> nice<00:02:12.239> little<00:02:12.420> fake<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.959> way

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
a nice little fake this way

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.040 
a nice little fake this way
he's<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.210> feel<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.930> that's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
he's going to think and feel that that's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.140 
he's going to think and feel that that's
where<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.440> way<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> way<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.340> going<00:02:17.670> my

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
where the way that the way I'm going my

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.480 
where the way that the way I'm going my
change<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.540> direction<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.070> little<00:02:20.400> bit

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
change of direction is a little bit

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.950 
change of direction is a little bit
better<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.880> use<00:02:21.120> when<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> guy<00:02:21.930> with

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
better to use when you see a guy with

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.400 
better to use when you see a guy with
the<00:02:22.230> parallel<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.740> stance<00:02:23.420> mainly<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.540> he

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the parallel of stance mainly because he

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.200 
the parallel of stance mainly because he
doesn't<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.740> where<00:02:25.950> you're<00:02:26.070> going<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.550> now

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
doesn't know where you're going so now

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
doesn't know where you're going so now
you<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.690> many<00:02:27.810> options<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:29.070> try<00:02:29.430> to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
you have so many options you just try to

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.970 
you have so many options you just try to
use<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.060> many<00:02:30.240> options<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.740> if<00:02:31.860> he

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
use as many options as you can now if he

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.690 
use as many options as you can now if he
had<00:02:32.160> his<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.550> foot<00:02:32.820> forward<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.460> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
had his right foot forward that to me is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.240 
had his right foot forward that to me is
saying<00:02:35.990> now<00:02:36.990> he<00:02:37.050> wants<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.740> go<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.040> way

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
saying now he wants you to go this way

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.130 
saying now he wants you to go this way
the<00:02:39.030> last<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.870> go<00:02:40.020> where

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the last thing I want to do is go where

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.810 
the last thing I want to do is go where
the<00:02:40.230> defense<00:02:40.560> wants<00:02:40.860> me<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.010> go<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.430> want<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> go

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
the defense wants me to go I want to go

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.800 
the defense wants me to go I want to go
opposite<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.530> when<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:44.850> he<00:02:45.330> takes

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
opposite so this is when now he takes

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.480 
opposite so this is when now he takes
his<00:02:46.020> step<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.650> way<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.100> change<00:02:47.370> of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
his step that way the change of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.180 
his step that way the change of
direction<00:02:47.610> means<00:02:48.410> he's<00:02:49.410> got<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> pick<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.010> this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
direction means he's got to pick up this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.240 
direction means he's got to pick up this
foot<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.610> open<00:02:51.600> then<00:02:52.020> slide<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.620> keep<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:52.950> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
foot and open then slide to keep up you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.520 
foot and open then slide to keep up you
as<00:02:53.610> an<00:02:53.820> offensive<00:02:54.150> player<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:55.050> takes<00:02:55.350> more

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
as an offensive player that takes more

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830 
as an offensive player that takes more
time<00:02:55.860> than<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.520> taking<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:56.970> crossover<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
time than you taking that crossover and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
time than you taking that crossover and
driving<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.860> hole<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
driving to the hole so you have the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.750 
driving to the hole so you have the
advantage<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.300> sense<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:02.459> he<00:03:02.610> has

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
advantage in that sense now if he has

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.730 
advantage in that sense now if he has
his<00:03:02.910> other<00:03:03.090> foot<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.380> what<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> was

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
his other foot up this is what I was

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.260 
his other foot up this is what I was
telling<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.130> about<00:03:05.160> being<00:03:05.550> able<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.850> go<00:03:06.030> both

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
telling you about being able to go both

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.600 
telling you about being able to go both
ways<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> same<00:03:08.070> thing<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
ways now you can do the same thing and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.440 
ways now you can do the same thing and
attack<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:10.020> way<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:11.700> sure<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.880> mean<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.300> now

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
attack it this way be sure I mean so now

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.940 
attack it this way be sure I mean so now
he<00:03:12.510> can't<00:03:12.930> limit<00:03:13.290> your<00:03:13.440> options<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.920> you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
he can't limit your options so you

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.100 
he can't limit your options so you
should<00:03:14.250> look<00:03:14.459> before<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.450> take<00:03:15.660> your<00:03:15.690> stance

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
should look before you take your stance

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.900 
should look before you take your stance
look<00:03:16.440> how<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> defense<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.130> playing<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.700> and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
look how the defense is playing you and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.020 
look how the defense is playing you and
then<00:03:19.160> decide<00:03:20.160> which<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.550> your<00:03:20.700> pivot<00:03:21.000> foot

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
then decide which is your pivot foot

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.940 
then decide which is your pivot foot
your<00:03:21.300> right<00:03:21.330> foot<00:03:21.750> or<00:03:22.320> your<00:03:22.440> left<00:03:22.590> foot<00:03:22.830> and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
your right foot or your left foot and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.519 
your right foot or your left foot and
then<00:03:23.220> attack
