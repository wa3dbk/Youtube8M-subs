00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
everybody talks about how thick it is

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.650 
everybody talks about how thick it is
and<00:00:59.500> how<00:00:59.530> how<00:01:00.039> heavy<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.429> might<00:01:00.609> be<00:01:00.879> but<00:01:01.510> this

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
and how how heavy it might be but this

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.240 
and how how heavy it might be but this
is<00:01:01.750> one<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.019> world's<00:01:02.140> first<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:03.100> actually

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
is one of the world's first it actually

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.310 
is one of the world's first it actually
never<00:01:03.730> exists<00:01:04.210> there's<00:01:04.390> no<00:01:04.540> product<00:01:04.930> like<00:01:04.990> it

never exists there's no product like it

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.990 
never exists there's no product like it
it's<00:01:05.530> only<00:01:05.680> three<00:01:05.950> kilograms<00:01:06.310> it's<00:01:06.760> less<00:01:06.970> than

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
it's only three kilograms it's less than

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's only three kilograms it's less than
an<00:01:07.210> inch<00:01:07.300> thick<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.830> gives<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.460> terms<00:01:09.730> of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
an inch thick it gives you in terms of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.850 
an inch thick it gives you in terms of
storage<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.050> talk<00:01:11.200> about<00:01:11.230> storage<00:01:11.710> we

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
storage if you talk about storage we

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.200 
storage if you talk about storage we
gives<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.220> we<00:01:12.490> have<00:01:12.670> something<00:01:12.940> called<00:01:12.970> a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
gives you we have something called a

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.450 
gives you we have something called a
rate<00:01:13.390> express<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:14.650> rate<00:01:14.770> Express<00:01:15.130> actually

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
rate express the rate Express actually

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.790 
rate express the rate Express actually
we<00:01:15.670> have<00:01:15.820> three<00:01:16.180> msata<00:01:16.570> ssds<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.410> could<00:01:17.590> put

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
we have three msata ssds you could put

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.950 
we have three msata ssds you could put
up<00:01:17.890> fit<00:01:18.040> up<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.190> you<00:01:18.670> have<00:01:18.790> three<00:01:19.000> slots<00:01:19.300> 512

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
up fit up to you have three slots 512

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.200 
up fit up to you have three slots 512
gigabyte<00:01:20.950> each<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.370> then<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.970> have<00:01:22.180> another

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
gigabyte each and then you have another

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.180 
gigabyte each and then you have another
hard<00:01:22.990> drive<00:01:23.140> bay<00:01:23.470> in<00:01:23.710> there<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.070> could

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
hard drive bay in there so you could

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.040 
hard drive bay in there so you could
actually<00:01:24.310> fit<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> two<00:01:24.940> terabyte<00:01:25.180> hard<00:01:25.840> drive

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
actually fit a two terabyte hard drive

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.450 
actually fit a two terabyte hard drive
bay<00:01:26.170> as<00:01:26.320> well<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:26.950> gives<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.310> ample

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
bay as well so that gives you ample

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.300 
bay as well so that gives you ample
storage<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.690> 17<00:01:29.140> inch<00:01:29.260> machine<00:01:29.530> now<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
storage in a 17 inch machine now the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.550 
storage in a 17 inch machine now the
other<00:01:30.460> thing<00:01:30.550> of<00:01:30.760> course<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.750> need<00:01:31.900> ram<00:01:32.260> to

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
other thing of course is you need ram to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.680 
other thing of course is you need ram to
process<00:01:32.980> all<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:34.180> know<00:01:34.300> special

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
process all that you know special

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.390 
process all that you know special
programs<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.530> need<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.770> have<00:01:35.980> running<00:01:36.310> all

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
programs you need to have running all

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.580 
programs you need to have running all
the<00:01:36.520> time<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.970> this<00:01:37.390> actually<00:01:37.600> has<00:01:37.900> 32<00:01:38.380> gigs

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
the time and this actually has 32 gigs

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.330 
the time and this actually has 32 gigs
of<00:01:38.740> ram<00:01:38.950> see<00:01:39.940> we<00:01:40.330> have<00:01:40.450> nvidia<00:01:40.750> surround<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
of ram see we have nvidia surround so

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.520 
of ram see we have nvidia surround so
this<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.730> another<00:01:42.940> factor<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.990> x7<00:01:44.440> that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
this is another factor of the x7 that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.930 
this is another factor of the x7 that
you<00:01:44.650> can<00:01:44.800> actually<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.550> gives<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.880> a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
you can actually have it gives you a

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.320 
you can actually have it gives you a
resolution<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.540> 57<00:01:47.200> 60<00:01:47.500> x<00:01:47.800> 1080<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:49.180> could

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
resolution of 57 60 x 1080 you could

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.020 
resolution of 57 60 x 1080 you could
also<00:01:49.540> have<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:50.110> 4k<00:01:50.560> output<00:01:51.370> through<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> mini

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
also have a 4k output through the mini

but<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.240> could<00:01:55.390> actually<00:01:55.540> do<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:55.900> now<00:01:56.830> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
but you could actually do that now the

at<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.310> moment<00:02:16.640> maybe<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.630> will<00:02:17.780> release<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
at the moment maybe they will release it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.500 
at the moment maybe they will release it
to<00:02:18.530> maybe<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.980> year<00:02:19.100> maybe<00:02:19.280> next<00:02:19.520> year<00:02:19.640> and

to maybe this year maybe next year and
trust<00:02:21.290> me<00:02:21.380> when<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.770> out<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.280> will<00:02:22.430> make<00:02:22.610> sure

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
trust me when it's out we will make sure

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.400 
trust me when it's out we will make sure
we<00:02:22.940> have<00:02:23.120> something<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:24.319> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
we have something like that when you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.809 
we have something like that when you
have<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.680> much<00:02:24.860> horsepower<00:02:25.340> or<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.670> guess

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
have that much horsepower or I guess

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.960 
have that much horsepower or I guess

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
would be a concern in terms of battery

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.610 
would be a concern in terms of battery
life<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.130> long<00:02:31.310> someone<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.670> go<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:33.440> on

life and how long someone can go for on
right<00:02:34.520> well<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.760> mean<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.030> terms<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.330> battery

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
right well I mean in terms of battery

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.840 
right well I mean in terms of battery
life<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.170> dual<00:02:36.560> graphics<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.580> does

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
life it is dual graphics so it does

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.940 
life it is dual graphics so it does
consume<00:02:38.239> quite<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.569> bit<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.840> power<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.800> make

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
consume quite a bit of power and to make

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.290 
consume quite a bit of power and to make
sure<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.880> enough<00:02:40.910> power

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
sure that you have enough power

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.150

unfortunately<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.170> might<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.920> carry

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
unfortunately you might have to carry

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.440 
unfortunately you might have to carry
the<00:02:43.280> power<00:02:43.430> brick<00:02:43.730> but<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.239> another

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
the power brick but that is another

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.180 
the power brick but that is another
compromise<00:02:44.900> some<00:02:45.319> some<00:02:45.680> people<00:02:45.950> are<00:02:46.040> willing

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
compromise some some people are willing

to<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.510> need<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> power<00:02:47.989> you're<00:02:48.230> gonna

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
to do if you need the power you're gonna

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.020 
to do if you need the power you're gonna

but<00:03:19.670> that's<00:03:19.820> not<00:03:19.880> true<00:03:20.209> for<00:03:20.239> 2299<00:03:21.079> you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
but that's not true for 2299 you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.410 
but that's not true for 2299 you
actually<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:21.769> three<00:03:22.130> slots<00:03:22.430> which<00:03:23.120> will<00:03:23.269> be

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
actually get three slots which will be

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually get three slots which will be
128<00:03:23.930> each<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.549> will<00:03:25.670> also<00:03:25.820> get

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
128 each and then you will also get

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.690 
128 each and then you will also get
another<00:03:26.570> terabyte<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.049> hard<00:03:27.170> drive<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:28.370> 16

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
another terabyte of hard drive with 16

another terabyte of hard drive with 16
gigs<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.060> RAM<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.570> would<00:03:29.660> be<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.840> base

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
gigs of RAM so that would be the base

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.840 
gigs of RAM so that would be the base
configuration<00:03:30.470> we're<00:03:30.860> starting<00:03:31.160> off<00:03:31.250> at<00:03:31.489> from

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
configuration we're starting off at from

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.620 
configuration we're starting off at from
2299<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.829> that's<00:03:33.980> great<00:03:34.100> that's<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.610> x7<00:03:35.450> here

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
2299 so that's great that's the x7 here

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.150 
2299 so that's great that's the x7 here
from<00:03:35.780> Orr's<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.170> they<00:03:36.230> also<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.799> smaller

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
from Orr's but they also have a smaller

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.229

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
something a little bit more portable so

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.620 
something a little bit more portable so
let's<00:03:39.829> go<00:03:39.950> have<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.130> look<00:03:40.190> at<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.299> the

computex we also have different variants
for<00:04:56.630> example<00:04:57.020> we<00:04:57.110> have<00:04:57.259> a<00:04:57.289> 13.3<00:04:57.979> inch<00:04:58.430> which<00:04:58.970> is

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
for example we have a 13.3 inch which is

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.070 
for example we have a 13.3 inch which is
called<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.479> x3<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.509> will<00:05:02.870> fall

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
called the x3 and that is that will fall

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.499 
called the x3 and that is that will fall
under<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.440> x3<00:05:03.800> family<00:05:04.250> in<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.669> 13.9<00:05:05.330> is

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
under the x3 family in the 13.9 is

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.230 
under the x3 family in the 13.9 is
called<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.840> x3<00:05:06.229> plus<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.699> also<00:05:07.910> notice

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
called the x3 plus and I also notice

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.909 
called the x3 plus and I also notice
that<00:05:08.270> like<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.720> bezel<00:05:09.320> around<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.650> displays

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
that like the bezel around the displays

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.469 
that like the bezel around the displays
actually<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.340> very<00:05:10.550> thin<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:10.970> even<00:05:11.270> out<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
actually it's very thin so even out of

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.240 
actually it's very thin so even out of
thirteen<00:05:12.139> point<00:05:12.410> nine<00:05:12.620> inch<00:05:12.830> screen<00:05:13.039> it's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
thirteen point nine inch screen it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.129 
thirteen point nine inch screen it's
actually<00:05:13.400> not<00:05:13.699> any<00:05:13.910> bigger<00:05:14.150> than<00:05:14.270> like<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.780> 13

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
actually not any bigger than like a 13

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.990 
actually not any bigger than like a 13
inch<00:05:15.349> looks<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.949> looks<00:05:16.070> beautiful<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.639> we

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
inch looks it looks beautiful and we

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.879 
inch looks it looks beautiful and we
think<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.300> really<00:05:17.479> perfectly<00:05:17.930> fits<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.440> our

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
think it really perfectly fits the our

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.770 
think it really perfectly fits the our
size<00:05:19.430> another<00:05:20.180> thing<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.360> forgot<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.659> mention

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
size another thing I forgot to mention

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.740 
size another thing I forgot to mention
we<00:05:21.169> did<00:05:21.409> say<00:05:21.560> is<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.889> lightest<00:05:22.300> we<00:05:23.300> also<00:05:23.479> say

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
we did say is the lightest we also say

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.390 
we did say is the lightest we also say
it<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:23.990> one<00:05:24.139> of<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.320> smallest<00:05:24.560> for<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.070> 13

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
it is one of the smallest for the 13

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.890 
it is one of the smallest for the 13
inch<00:05:25.520> because<00:05:25.699> this<00:05:25.909> is<00:05:26.000> only<00:05:26.090> three<00:05:26.659> hundred

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
inch because this is only three hundred

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.450 
inch because this is only three hundred
and<00:05:26.990> thirty<00:05:27.199> millimeters<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.039> footprint

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
and thirty millimeters so the footprint

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.080 
and thirty millimeters so the footprint
of<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:28.820> machine<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.599> really<00:05:30.470> tiny<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.849> lot

kind of price range should people expect

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.529 
kind of price range should people expect
through<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:00.919> x<00:06:01.070> 3<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:01.460> x<00:06:01.520> 3<00:06:01.639> plus<00:06:01.940> it's<00:06:02.300> going

through the x 3 and x 3 plus it's going

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.969 
through the x 3 and x 3 plus it's going
to<00:06:02.599> be<00:06:02.690> someone<00:06:03.110> from<00:06:03.139> 2099<00:06:03.979> to<00:06:04.849> 2599<00:06:05.979> maybe

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
to be someone from 2099 to 2599 maybe

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.670 
to be someone from 2099 to 2599 maybe
for<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:07.190> x3<00:06:07.610> plus<00:06:07.909> it<00:06:08.180> could<00:06:08.539> be<00:06:08.720> 20<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.289> 49

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
for the x3 plus it could be 20 to 49

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.140 
for the x3 plus it could be 20 to 49
that<00:06:10.099> might<00:06:10.280> be<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.460> base<00:06:10.699> configuration

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
that might be the base configuration

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.480 
that might be the base configuration
we're<00:06:11.509> looking<00:06:11.780> at<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:12.229> how<00:06:12.830> big<00:06:13.039> is<00:06:13.280> the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
we're looking at and how big is the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.700 
we're looking at and how big is the
battery<00:06:14.120> inside<00:06:14.449> the<00:06:15.080> battery<00:06:15.229> again<00:06:15.560> is

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
battery inside the battery again is

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.240 
battery inside the battery again is
closer<00:06:16.070> to<00:06:16.190> 75<00:06:16.610> watt<00:06:16.970> hour<00:06:17.259> so<00:06:18.259> we're<00:06:18.949> hoping

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
closer to 75 watt hour so we're hoping

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.410 
closer to 75 watt hour so we're hoping
that<00:06:19.340> so<00:06:19.729> usually<00:06:20.150> we<00:06:20.270> like<00:06:20.449> to<00:06:20.630> you<00:06:21.199> know

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
that so usually we like to you know

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.090 
that so usually we like to you know
at<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.600> media<00:06:21.870> test<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.440> let<00:06:22.800> us<00:06:22.920> know<00:06:23.070> how

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
at the media test it and let us know how

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.610 
at the media test it and let us know how
long<00:06:23.430> the<00:06:23.610> battery<00:06:23.760> life<00:06:24.030> is<00:06:24.270> on<00:06:24.540> it<00:06:24.690> because

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
long the battery life is on it because

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.560 
long the battery life is on it because
everybody<00:06:26.100> has<00:06:26.310> different<00:06:26.670> kind<00:06:27.060> of<00:06:27.120> test<00:06:27.420> I'd

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
everybody has different kind of test I'd

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.830 
everybody has different kind of test I'd
like<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.810> do<00:06:28.190> but<00:06:29.190> looking<00:06:29.970> at<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.270> you<00:06:30.720> know

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
like to do but looking at the you know

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.690 
like to do but looking at the you know
the<00:06:31.020> looking<00:06:31.260> at<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.470> 75<00:06:31.890> watt<00:06:32.100> hour<00:06:32.250> we<00:06:32.490> would

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
the looking at the 75 watt hour we would

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.430
