battery box that means the safety
standards<00:02:12.870> but

standards but

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.229 
standards but
in<00:02:13.319> my<00:02:13.440> case<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.550> fun<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.790> card

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
in my case it's just a fun little card

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.809 
in my case it's just a fun little card
that<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.450> drive<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> streets<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.129> don't

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
that I drive on the streets and I don't

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.910 
that I drive on the streets and I don't
do<00:02:17.909> any<00:02:18.120> aggressive<00:02:18.629> serious<00:02:19.349> competitive

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
do any aggressive serious competitive

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.850 
do any aggressive serious competitive
racing<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.970> tater<00:02:21.450> battery<00:02:21.870> box<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.409> okay<00:02:22.799> for

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
racing so tater battery box was okay for

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.520 
racing so tater battery box was okay for
me<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.239> could<00:02:24.420> imagine<00:02:24.510> there's<00:02:25.049> nothing

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
me and you could imagine there's nothing

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.229 
me and you could imagine there's nothing
here<00:02:25.769> in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> trunk<00:02:26.280> area<00:02:26.459> when<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.909> begin

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
here in the trunk area when you begin

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.440 
here in the trunk area when you begin
the<00:02:27.390> installation<00:02:27.659> process<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.970> hardest

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the installation process the hardest

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500 
the installation process the hardest
part<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.810> guess<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.290> drilling<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.250> hole<00:02:32.730> for

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
part I guess is drilling the hole for

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.530 
part I guess is drilling the hole for
this<00:02:33.750> boat<00:02:34.049> go<00:02:34.379> sir<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.370> boat<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.060> goes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
this boat go sir this boat actually goes

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.479 
this boat go sir this boat actually goes
through<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.930> trunk<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.709> drilled<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.250> hole<00:02:38.280> right

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
through the trunk I drilled a hole right

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.270 
through the trunk I drilled a hole right
here<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.720> right<00:02:40.140> side<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:41.099> on<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
here on the right side and here on the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.850 
here on the right side and here on the
left<00:02:41.489> side<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.360> there's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> knot<00:02:43.110> coming<00:02:43.650> from

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
left side and there's a knot coming from

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.559 
left side and there's a knot coming from
the<00:02:44.040> bottom<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.459> car<00:02:44.670> holding<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.269> boat

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
the bottom of the car holding this boat

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.539 
the bottom of the car holding this boat
in<00:02:45.750> place<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.379> what<00:02:46.680> basically<00:02:46.890> shuts

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
in place and that's what basically shuts

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.699 
in place and that's what basically shuts
down<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.060> battery<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.319> little<00:02:49.590> loose

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
down this battery it's a little loose

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.699 
down this battery it's a little loose
right<00:02:50.010> now<00:02:50.160> because<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.879> was<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.599> took<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
right now because I was I took the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.349 
right now because I was I took the
battery<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.519> wintertime<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
battery out for the wintertime because I

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.390 
battery out for the wintertime because I
don't<00:02:54.540> drive<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> car<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> winter

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
don't drive this car in the winter

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.119 
don't drive this car in the winter
connection-wise<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.720> ground<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.379> lot

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
connection-wise you got the ground a lot

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.599 
connection-wise you got the ground a lot
of<00:02:59.340> people<00:02:59.849> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.109> evos<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.680> least<00:03:01.920> ground<00:03:02.430> it

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
of people on the evos at least ground it

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.030 
of people on the evos at least ground it
right<00:03:02.849> here<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.450> frame<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> car<00:03:04.230> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
right here to the frame of the car you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.099 
right here to the frame of the car you
can<00:03:05.250> kind<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.579> see<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> signed<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> down

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
can kind of see that I signed it down

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.819 
can kind of see that I signed it down
the<00:03:07.470> frame<00:03:07.980> surface<00:03:09.079> when<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.109> install<00:03:10.650> this

the frame surface when I install this

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.150 
the frame surface when I install this
initially<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:13.109> good<00:03:13.530> contact

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
initially so that you get good contact

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000 
initially so that you get good contact

real<00:03:53.040> seats<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.549> my<00:03:53.579> car<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.269> really<00:03:54.540> just

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
real seats in my car so it's really just

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.800 
real seats in my car so it's really just
sitting<00:03:55.919> here<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.329> not<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.569> pretty

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
sitting here I know it's not a pretty

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.150 
sitting here I know it's not a pretty
installation<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.099> it<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.269> what<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:01.160> the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
installation but it is what it is the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.099 
installation but it is what it is the
wurr<00:04:02.280> cable<00:04:02.700> comes<00:04:02.970> through<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.419> rear<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
wurr cable comes through the rear of the

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.129 
wurr cable comes through the rear of the
car<00:04:04.349> in<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.489> rear<00:04:05.760> passenger<00:04:06.389> seat<00:04:06.690> under<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
car in the rear passenger seat under the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.680 
car in the rear passenger seat under the
passenger<00:04:07.319> seat<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.190> kind<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.239> hides<00:04:09.449> into

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
passenger seat and it kind of hides into

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.479 
passenger seat and it kind of hides into
the<00:04:10.040> b-pillar<00:04:11.040> area

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.310 

and<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.609> essentially<00:04:17.120> continue<00:04:17.810> running<00:04:17.989> so

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
and you essentially continue running so

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.450 
and you essentially continue running so
the<00:04:18.530> pillar<00:04:18.940> under<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> dash<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:22.040> cable

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
the pillar under the dash and the cable

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.760 
the pillar under the dash and the cable
runs<00:04:22.790> through<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.419> firewall<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:27.169> coming<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
runs through the firewall so coming to

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.560 
runs through the firewall so coming to
the<00:04:28.040> front<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.580> car<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:31.729> can<00:04:32.000> kind<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.360> see

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
the front of the car you can kind of see

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.930 
the front of the car you can kind of see
that<00:04:32.810> cable<00:04:33.320> coming<00:04:33.710> out<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.100> firewall<00:04:34.760> on

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
that cable coming out of the firewall on

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.689 
that cable coming out of the firewall on
the<00:04:35.180> passenger<00:04:35.690> side<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:37.340> will<00:04:37.490> run

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
the passenger side and you will run

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.779 
the passenger side and you will run
across<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:38.510> engine<00:04:38.990> bay<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.590> meet<00:04:40.400> what<00:04:40.639> the

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
across the engine bay and meet what the

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.990 
across the engine bay and meet what the
stock<00:04:41.120> battery<00:04:41.570> connector<00:04:42.440> was<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.490> it's<00:04:43.760> not

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
stock battery connector was so it's not

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.659 
stock battery connector was so it's not
a<00:04:44.060> pretty<00:04:44.389> job<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:45.590> was<00:04:45.770> something<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.370> did

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
a pretty job this was something I did

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.270 
a pretty job this was something I did
over<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.120> weekend<00:04:47.570> outside<00:04:48.560> in<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.889> parking

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
over the weekend outside in the parking

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.600 
over the weekend outside in the parking
lot<00:04:49.460> about<00:04:49.910> five<00:04:50.330> years<00:04:50.570> ago<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.039> do<00:04:52.220> plan

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
lot about five years ago but I do plan

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.040 
lot about five years ago but I do plan
on<00:04:52.789> cleaning<00:04:53.000> this<00:04:53.330> up<00:04:53.510> when<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> have<00:04:53.960> the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
on cleaning this up when I have the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.900 
on cleaning this up when I have the
opportunity<00:04:54.430> so<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.699> a<00:04:55.729> quick

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
opportunity so that was a quick

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.939 
opportunity so that was a quick
explanation<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.930> how<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.620> battery

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
explanation of how the battery

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.730 
explanation of how the battery
relocation<00:04:58.940> process<00:04:59.180> went<00:04:59.600> down<00:04:59.870> on<00:05:00.139> the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
relocation process went down on the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.070 
relocation process went down on the
Evo's<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.370> stock<00:05:01.639> battery<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.120> located<00:05:02.419> in

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
Evo's the stock battery is located in

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.800 
Evo's the stock battery is located in
this<00:05:03.350> area<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.130> as<00:05:04.789> you<00:05:04.970> can<00:05:05.120> see<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:05.780> have

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
this area so as you can see if you have

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.830 
this area so as you can see if you have
intercooler<00:05:06.770> piping<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:08.060> runs<00:05:08.449> through

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
intercooler piping that runs through

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.080 
intercooler piping that runs through
this<00:05:09.229> area<00:05:09.620> you<00:05:09.889> have<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.370> remove<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:10.910> battery

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
this area you have to remove the battery

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.120 
this area you have to remove the battery
and<00:05:11.270> rotate<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.229> back<00:05:12.440> or<00:05:12.680> go<00:05:12.889> with<00:05:13.100> the

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
and rotate it to the back or go with the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.620 
and rotate it to the back or go with the
smaller<00:05:13.580> battery<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.270> get<00:05:14.449> that

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
smaller battery so you get that

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.050 
smaller battery so you get that
clearance<00:05:15.169> but<00:05:15.889> it's<00:05:16.460> really<00:05:16.760> not<00:05:16.850> that<00:05:16.910> hard

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
clearance but it's really not that hard

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.330 
clearance but it's really not that hard
to<00:05:17.389> remove<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.289> battery<00:05:18.440> from<00:05:18.740> front<00:05:19.190> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
to remove the battery from front to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.909 
to remove the battery from front to
front<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.849> back<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.360> car<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:21.740> really

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
front to the back of the car it really

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.040 
front to the back of the car it really
gives<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.460> that<00:05:22.490> much<00:05:22.699> space<00:05:23.150> in<00:05:23.449> the<00:05:23.630> engine

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
gives you that much space in the engine

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.740 
gives you that much space in the engine
bay<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.320> walk<00:05:24.680> with<00:05:24.919> as<00:05:25.610> well<00:05:25.970> as<00:05:26.180> distribute

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
bay to walk with as well as distribute

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.750 
bay to walk with as well as distribute
that<00:05:27.289> way<00:05:27.470> from<00:05:27.770> front<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.310> rear<00:05:28.550> of<00:05:28.669> the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
that way from front to the rear of the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.820 
that way from front to the rear of the
car<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.810> that's<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.110> guy<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.650> quick
