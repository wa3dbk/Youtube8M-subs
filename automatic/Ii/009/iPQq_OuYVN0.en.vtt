standard<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:22.579> believe<00:01:22.880> me<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.329> ride<00:01:23.539> is

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
standard and believe me the ride is

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.169 
standard and believe me the ride is
extremely<00:01:24.740> harsh<00:01:24.979> compared<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.640> modern<00:01:25.820> cars

but despite all of that it is fantastic

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.370 
but despite all of that it is fantastic
fun<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.869> drive<00:01:30.079> but<00:01:31.689> because<00:01:32.689> of<00:01:32.810> its<00:01:32.929> age<00:01:33.170> it

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
fun to drive but because of its age it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.419 
fun to drive but because of its age it
means<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.770> there<00:01:33.890> are<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.250> positive

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429

different to the marque for petrol GTI
but<00:04:02.879> where<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.810> engines<00:04:04.230> concerned<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.010> a

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
but where the engines concerned it's a

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.660 
but where the engines concerned it's a
completely<00:04:05.639> different<00:04:06.239> ballgame<00:04:07.609> for<00:04:08.609> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
completely different ballgame for a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.550 
completely different ballgame for a
start<00:04:09.030> there's<00:04:09.389> an<00:04:09.480> awful<00:04:09.930> lot<00:04:10.049> more<00:04:10.079> torque

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
start there's an awful lot more torque

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.589 
start there's an awful lot more torque
and<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.069> comes<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.519> much<00:04:11.909> lower<00:04:12.180> down<00:04:12.450> the

when you first start up and at low
speeds<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.479> does<00:04:36.630> then<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> teeny<00:04:37.259> bit<00:04:37.590> like<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
speeds it does then a teeny bit like a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.339 
speeds it does then a teeny bit like a
