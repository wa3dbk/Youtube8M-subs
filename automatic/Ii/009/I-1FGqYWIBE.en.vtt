00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.779
 that's fine people will remember it 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.080
 when I'm going to think 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 also doctor manhattan 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 we are arriving somewhere in units 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.409
 everything is coming out of my hands 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.400
 we repeat 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.950
 superman exists and this American according to pentagon sources this 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 minimum increment can control the atomic structure 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.330
 so far there has been no crack response 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.150
 the super human nicknamed doctor manhattan 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.290
 he has not spoken to the press 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.820
 instead, we asked the vigilantes who are left out of the fashion of the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 masked heroes of the 40 entenza 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 well we are satisfied with the tie 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.530
 nor in my dreams 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.590
 they already know 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 that goes through walls and things like that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 in the report 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 sometimes I feel as if I have always been 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 the history and the work in 1960 saying those things 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 if it televises 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.120
 now it's culminated 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 a charity event with several costumed adventurers 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.750
 middle-aged friendly men who like to dress up 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.980
 I have nothing in common 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.630
 only the youngest one named josé martínez seems interesting 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.810
 the newspapers call me a crime fighter then the pentagon 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.760
 he says I should fight him 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.970
 at present your house 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.220
 the witnesses become cries of terror 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.520
 the mode of my activities in escazu 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.910
 in September 1961 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.450
 John Kennedy is shaking my hand and asking me what it feels like to be a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.310
 Super Hero 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 I tell him that he should know and so laughing 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.040
 two years later felling his head moves to the front and the guards 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.689
 in May of 1962 a masked man retires to open a car business 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.179
 his real name is juan espinosa 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.269
 we are talking after a civic banquet in the zone 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.879
 besides it is still 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.789
 asensio eight months 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:22.939
 of being this 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.939
 I almost regret leaving this ridiculous business 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.989
 then why did you decide to withdraw this information now? 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.149
 in the part 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.589
 I suppose in part it's you 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.199
 with someone with you the whole situation change 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.689
 you can do everything all I can offer is a good hook 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.369
 left 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.299
 also better retreating 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.040
 writing my autobiography repairing the cars of the people the cars are something 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.649
 what makes me happy 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.919
 and a time is missing so that he even had the certainty of the general motors good the 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.929
 new electric cars should be even simpler 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.329
 the districts 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.639
 A) Yes 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.299
 they would have appeared before but there was not enough lithium to produce batteries 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.339
 Chilean polyester mass 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.339
 of course I can synthesize it easy 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.089
 It was interesting to see you again 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.089
 I hope you enjoy your profile 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.249

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.989
 to 18 months in a limousine on the bench is entering the square 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.079
 what we are doing is wise that would kill him 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.749
 at the beginning of this century because there was not something 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.269
 I can not avoid the future 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.259
 for my daughter is happening 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.669

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.799

 as if it was not enough 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.439
 his prediction is very outdated 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.829
 we make love right after he comes back and he does not know what it is worse to have 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.809

 I am informing the pentagon that I no longer use in a whole myth 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.539
 It's 1966 I'm in a room with people in disguise 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.910
