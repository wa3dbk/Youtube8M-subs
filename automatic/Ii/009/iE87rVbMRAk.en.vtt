00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.029
 Anyway, I will take charge of the power training course by taking the 85th issue of the kudzu problem and they say that they are 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:13.130
 I will 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.540
 They say that they will go across their favorite meeting north name but if you get them to remember 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.770
 But I think that good 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:24.740
 When the Well imagine say whether this mine is what kind of people to target 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:30.320
 Well I memorized 14 o'clock of cherries , but if it was a problem and it is combined use 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.530
 You can also do unkie source or something like that 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.449
 The power that I read is the place that solves the problem of Julie 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.500
 Oh, I thought I Do not want to exercise that kind of power is let me do it this kind of mine 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:47.370
 The I mean to do that what I'd specifically wanted to let Yappa to know everyone 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 It is little I ask to see it because I am a little north 1 also to prepare a problem because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.560
 From 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.050
 I guess this is a problem I have prepared, but this is the question 1 of the big question 3 of 2013 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.320
 That's a problem 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.519
 Well there is a problem barn written, but the following figure 1 is the industrial structure in some countries 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.909
 With the changes 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.770
 Well since 1970 had been a change in the industry employment rate in the period of 2000 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.040
 To explain briefly 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.190
 Sankyu' only to Don this which country I kind of Benxi middle industry 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:29.420
 It's a graph that represents the kind of thing you say why you work in the tertiary industry 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:31.850
 By Yeah Yeah because c is enough but these three and is one of America China Japan America 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 It is not to say with any of Japan Gaya 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.750
 In China, there is no such thing as Hong Kong and Taiwan in China 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.010
 In Well it's not such important when told such Vol. 14 Well were in the prima facie 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.520
 Nde has been tentatively explained 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:51.579
 If a to c are the correct country names and you choose one from the period of 4 e power 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 Well this is from China Japan America 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.799
 Which it is 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 Oh yeah, how to read this graph 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:04.900
 Graph Suu How to read without my even actually remember 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 Well then, if you choose how to choose it 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.899
 For now 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:15.569
 I want you to add it to 100 and extend it . 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.440
 For example ｰｰｰwas a fellow of Beaute Kure this such way that leads to under this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.920
 This refers to the direction guy 's Nenda 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 In, for example, it may be that this was left oblique 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.840
 If you agree to the left, this white star this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:36.970
 Over the 80th 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:45.860
 Well, when I was stretching out here and there, it's Boo Boo so it's more real than this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:48.860
 Because there is no feeling that there is no feeling here and there is only a feeling, Hillary right next to it 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.020
 This is about 0 or 30 shots 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:00.080
 In roughly when Koch Well then another here is extend this to the Do not only this out just 20% 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I say I'll be in campers immediately read this graph Well the sitter this 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:09.540
 Call me and go right next to this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.030
 Serving and also I'm easy to understand reading on 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.480
 Then , between 1970 and 2000 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.250
 This Japan USA China 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.890
 There is nothing in the industry that only one industry is really repelled 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.790
 If you say it somewhere 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.000
 That's right, it's China, but it hasn't bounced that much since China 2000s 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.799
 Is the country that has not left it Africa's? 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.940
 Mayu was I bad Well after all agriculture in the sides been actively carried out 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.180
 It is not is not likely to do at all Toka industrial and or catastrophe 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.210
 So if you think that if you choose such a country you will grow high 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.700
 There is about 80% of primary industry 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.280
 Yaro another this absolute China 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.300
 Well then let's decide this in China a is China 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.540
 Movie China South is the third and fifth 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:07.020
 1246 Is not it from the other choices at this point 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.560
 Well then America and Japan will meet each other 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.640
 2000 yen is 10 American 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.530
 When I thought which one was developing 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.820
 I'd think it rain Rickard Well most people me think 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.630
 Well then 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.750
 If it is developed, what kind of industry is developed? 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.850
 I think the service industry will develop after all 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.060
 After all agriculture If it thinks from the history of Japan It starts with agriculture 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.810
 Such or the time after all the machinery industry 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.550
 Well said in the secondary industry and now the third industrial service 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.650
 Considering that what is reflected in the class is the way of development of the country, it is American 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:52.800
 It means that one is developing 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.340
 Article 33 is mixed with this and look at the way you are'm in this graph it is many of the United States 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.520
 This blue one is 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.729
 It is the United States that blue is advanced to the third industry 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.660
 As such it 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.720
 this 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.110
 It is America that it is America 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.910
 c No. 5 in the US is c 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:17.090
 You answer becomes No. 5 by 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:20.540
 The problem of geography melts like this, so it's beautiful, like this 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:28.040
 Well I do not remember this graph trouble I like this 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:30.900
 Even though I don't remember such numbers, I can get some common sense without some knowledge 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.960
 I want to say Te Don' this Onan' 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.630
 j 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:42.529
 To begin with me and if you try to open why this kind of lesson is I mean door seek Ronin raw of thinking 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.400
 I Well it should see the center at the time of active duty I'd 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.669
 Pretty cherry 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.820
 Well this Well fine but I did not study such to 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.950
 I think it's solved 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.140
 Even if this is bad, there are about 70 points at the worst, and I'm still boasting for a little more 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.430
 I thought it was a pretty fashionable point 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.420
 It was self-scored 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:09.630
 The face is already pale 70 points 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:13.500
 Even if it is worse , I think that I took several points 70 Alpha 60 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:21.210
 It is 50 more low 19 stores 19 stores 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.249
 I'm not surprised I 'm desperate for my own talent 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.259
 Is 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:30.990
 It I had the knowledge to some extent in the study a little means of cherry 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:35.220
 Soil fertility from which I'd had the knowledge to some extent 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:43.740
 There was no way of thinking to solve Shelly's problem, wasn't it? 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:49.140
 In this class I said that way of thinking in this class and I will give you the power I did not have when I was active. 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:52.730
 I think that this class piece stick so that you can visit siri in perfect condition from the first year 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.730
 Also please my best regards from now on because the
