 Of exciting product 7 Qi this time 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.110
 I would like to see made noodles 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 If you call the description of the product that is exciting 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.730
 The reason the lid of the power panel on the First on the back of exciting goods instead of placing the lotus button 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.850
 Take out the grain dam 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:34.820
 It seems to put grain gum directly in this 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.820
 It seems to use by closing the lid firmly 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.820

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.120
 me 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.490
 It is around the icon of the characters, such as waiting for Pokemon and Pazudora to say lucky Rare 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.270
 When it comes out 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.270
 From this sim card is installed and likely part on the side 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.740
 It seems that it is a mechanism that comes out of the granular gum 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 Ssu 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.500

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:36.130
 3rd Generation It is not the abbreviation of the generation that ruins the 4th generation
