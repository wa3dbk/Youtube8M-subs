00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
and bout a year ago and I remember the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.610 
and bout a year ago and I remember the
first<00:01:00.910> question<00:01:01.390> asked<00:01:01.660> all<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.810> us<00:01:01.990> which<00:01:02.350> was

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
first question asked all of us which was

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.160 
first question asked all of us which was
why<00:01:03.310> are<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:03.550> here<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.630> reason<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.960> gave

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
why are you here and the reason I gave

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.680 
why are you here and the reason I gave
you<00:01:05.350> was<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:06.040> I'm<00:01:06.310> getting<00:01:06.340> older<00:01:06.760> I<00:01:07.150> was

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
you was that as I'm getting older I was

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.300 
you was that as I'm getting older I was
concerned<00:01:08.140> about<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.650> pounding<00:01:09.100> i<00:01:09.190> was

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
concerned about the pounding i was

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700 
concerned about the pounding i was
taking<00:01:09.670> from<00:01:09.850> running<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.360> never<00:01:11.320> had<00:01:11.530> any

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
taking from running and never had any

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.070 
taking from running and never had any
formal<00:01:12.010> instruction<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:13.300> was<00:01:13.660> hoping<00:01:13.810> that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
formal instruction and I was hoping that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.880 
formal instruction and I was hoping that
she<00:01:14.620> running<00:01:14.980> would<00:01:15.160> help<00:01:15.670> me<00:01:15.790> run<00:01:16.030> easier

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
she running would help me run easier

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.290 
she running would help me run easier
unlike<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> lot<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.310> people<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.120> class

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
unlike a lot of the people in the class

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.940 
unlike a lot of the people in the class
I<00:01:19.510> wasn't<00:01:19.780> trying<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.050> run<00:01:20.200> faster<00:01:20.680> just

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
I wasn't trying to run faster just

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.360 
I wasn't trying to run faster just
easier<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:22.440> since<00:01:23.440> then<00:01:23.680> it's<00:01:23.920> really<00:01:24.250> been

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
easier and since then it's really been

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.960 
easier and since then it's really been
successful<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:26.040> finished<00:01:27.040> probably<00:01:27.790> two<00:01:27.940> or

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
successful I finished probably two or

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.600 
successful I finished probably two or
three<00:01:28.090> marathons<00:01:28.510> since<00:01:28.990> then<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:30.190> find<00:01:30.460> at

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
three marathons since then and I find at

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.520 
three marathons since then and I find at
the<00:01:30.700> end<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.970> them<00:01:31.150> now<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:31.510> don't<00:01:31.840> hurt<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.350> don't

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
the end of them now I don't hurt I don't

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.290 
the end of them now I don't hurt I don't
feel<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.950> pounding<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.490> way<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:33.640> used<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:34.030> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
feel the pounding the way I used to and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.030 
feel the pounding the way I used to and
of<00:01:35.170> course<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.470> other<00:01:35.590> thing<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.830> was<00:01:36.010> a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
of course the other thing that was a

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.680 
of course the other thing that was a
surprise<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.729> I've<00:01:37.119> mentioned<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:37.540> before

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
surprise that I've mentioned you before

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.440 
surprise that I've mentioned you before
is<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.920> hills<00:01:39.160> really<00:01:39.910> disappeared

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
is that the hills really disappeared

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.780 
is that the hills really disappeared
that<00:01:41.050> was<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.650> most<00:01:41.800> dramatic<00:01:41.979> thing<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.640> me<00:01:42.760> I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
that was the most dramatic thing to me I

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.540 
that was the most dramatic thing to me I
was<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.119> little<00:01:43.390> skeptical<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.040> technique

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
was a little skeptical of the technique

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.300 
was a little skeptical of the technique
at<00:01:45.729> first<00:01:46.000> until<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.630> really<00:01:47.110> got<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.380> down<00:01:47.410> but

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
at first until I really got it down but

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
at first until I really got it down but
I<00:01:48.340> found<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.850> made<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> tremendous

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
I found that made a tremendous

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.359 
I found that made a tremendous
difference<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.380> I'm<00:01:50.500> really<00:01:50.680> happy<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.250> I

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
difference to so I'm really happy and I

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.130 
difference to so I'm really happy and I
appreciate<00:01:52.090> your<00:01:52.270> work<00:01:52.479> thank<00:01:52.720> you

running<00:01:59.620> has<00:01:59.770> helped<00:02:00.040> me<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.159> many<00:02:00.460> many<00:02:00.729> ways

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
running has helped me in many many ways

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.790 
running has helped me in many many ways
but<00:02:01.330> more<00:02:01.659> important<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.170> think<00:02:02.260> one<00:02:02.620> of<00:02:02.650> the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
but more important I think one of the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.530 
but more important I think one of the
significant<00:02:03.430> benefits<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:03.909> I've<00:02:04.030> seen<00:02:04.270> is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
significant benefits that I've seen is

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.690 
significant benefits that I've seen is
relaxation<00:02:05.290> i<00:02:05.950> mean<00:02:06.130> when<00:02:06.340> i<00:02:06.369> think<00:02:06.490> about

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
relaxation i mean when i think about

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.639 
relaxation i mean when i think about
relaxation<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:07.690> had<00:02:07.930> never<00:02:08.229> thought<00:02:08.410> about

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
relaxation I had never thought about

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.070 
relaxation I had never thought about
running<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.550> relaxation<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.869> same

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
running and relaxation in the same

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.720 
running and relaxation in the same
breath<00:02:11.350> before<00:02:11.590> until<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.130> took<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.550> Chi

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
breath before until I took the Chi

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.730 
breath before until I took the Chi
running<00:02:13.030> classes<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.350> the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
running classes and one of the the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.440 
running classes and one of the the
epiphanies<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.520> me<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:15.850> right<00:02:16.060> after<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
epiphanies for me was right after the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.570 
epiphanies for me was right after the
class<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.170> went<00:02:17.740> out<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.980> next<00:02:18.160> day<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
class I went out the next day and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.540 
class I went out the next day and
started<00:02:19.030> running<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.410> low<00:02:20.890> part<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.430> my

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
started running and the low part of my

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.210 
started running and the low part of my
body<00:02:21.760> or<00:02:22.060> below<00:02:22.360> my<00:02:22.570> waist<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.530> said<00:02:23.739> relax

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
body or below my waist I just said relax

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.000 
body or below my waist I just said relax
and<00:02:24.550> once<00:02:25.270> relaxing<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.020> made<00:02:26.500> an<00:02:26.620> amazing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
and once relaxing I made an amazing

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.920 
and once relaxing I made an amazing
discovery<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.970> discovered<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.840> was

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
discovery I discovered that I was

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.140 
discovery I discovered that I was
crunching<00:02:29.470> up<00:02:29.650> my<00:02:29.800> toes<00:02:30.100> while<00:02:30.459> running<00:02:30.489> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
crunching up my toes while running and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720 
crunching up my toes while running and
then<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.780> said<00:02:31.989> relax<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.920> relaxed<00:02:33.370> my<00:02:33.489> feet

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
then I said relax and I relaxed my feet

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.520 
then I said relax and I relaxed my feet
and<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:33.940> toes<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.570> all<00:02:34.750> came<00:02:34.989> together<00:02:35.200> for

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and my toes and it all came together for

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.220 
and my toes and it all came together for
me<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.180> look<00:02:37.209> at<00:02:37.540> running<00:02:37.930> I've

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
me and so now as I look at running I've

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.949 
me and so now as I look at running I've
taken<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.100> whole<00:02:39.370> nother<00:02:39.959> direction

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
taken on just a whole nother direction

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.960 
taken on just a whole nother direction
am<00:02:41.080> i<00:02:41.170> running<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.680> terms<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.190> being<00:02:42.700> more

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
am i running in terms of being more

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.449 
am i running in terms of being more
relaxed<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:43.720> being<00:02:44.019> more<00:02:44.230> body<00:02:44.650> alert<00:02:45.190> and

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
relaxed and being more body alert and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.400 
relaxed and being more body alert and
conscious<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:46.360> how<00:02:46.540> my<00:02:46.750> feet<00:02:46.989> are<00:02:47.140> hitting<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
conscious of how my feet are hitting the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.650 
conscious of how my feet are hitting the
ground<00:02:47.650> how<00:02:48.220> my<00:02:48.400> legs<00:02:48.730> are<00:02:49.060> feeling<00:02:49.239> when<00:02:49.540> I'm

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
ground how my legs are feeling when I'm

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.420 
ground how my legs are feeling when I'm
running<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.470> it's<00:02:50.650> opened<00:02:51.040> up<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.250> whole

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
running and so it's opened up a whole

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.630 
running and so it's opened up a whole
new<00:02:51.459> area<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:52.450> me<00:02:52.600> in<00:02:52.690> terms<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:53.019> running

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.750 

oh<00:02:57.080> thanks<00:02:58.080> for<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.260> invitation<00:02:58.520> yeah<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.550> have

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.920 
oh thanks for the invitation yeah I have
been<00:02:59.910> running<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.360> very<00:03:00.720> long<00:03:00.870> time

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
been running for a very long time

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.190 
been running for a very long time
somewhere<00:03:01.760> 40-plus<00:03:02.760> years<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.180> think<00:03:03.240> but<00:03:04.020> all

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
somewhere 40-plus years I think but all

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.350 
somewhere 40-plus years I think but all
that<00:03:04.830> time<00:03:05.130> without<00:03:05.310> any<00:03:05.610> formal<00:03:05.850> instruction

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that time without any formal instruction

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.430 
that time without any formal instruction
so<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:06.990> joined<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:08.300> with<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.450> desire<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.930> get

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
so I joined you with the desire to get

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.780 
so I joined you with the desire to get
some<00:03:10.650> formal<00:03:10.980> training<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.400> see<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.730> could

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
some formal training to see if I could

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.449 
some formal training to see if I could
keep<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.480> longer<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.190> better<00:03:14.400> than

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
keep going longer or do it better than

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.730 
keep going longer or do it better than
what<00:03:14.640> I've<00:03:14.760> been<00:03:14.880> doing<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.300> past<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.930> one

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
what I've been doing in the past and one

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.190 
what I've been doing in the past and one
of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> details<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.550> has<00:03:17.820> worked<00:03:18.750> best<00:03:19.020> for

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
of the details that has worked best for

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.470 
of the details that has worked best for
me<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.130> ability<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:21.090> use<00:03:21.270> my

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
me I think is the ability to use my

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.120 
me I think is the ability to use my
diaphragm<00:03:21.840> while<00:03:22.260> breathing<00:03:22.500> rather<00:03:22.950> than

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
diaphragm while breathing rather than

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.530 
diaphragm while breathing rather than
just<00:03:23.310> breathing<00:03:23.670> through<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:23.910> chest<00:03:24.180> as<00:03:24.360> I've

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
just breathing through my chest as I've

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.979 
just breathing through my chest as I've
done<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.440> last<00:03:25.770> 40<00:03:26.700> odd<00:03:26.850> years<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.420> think

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
done for the last 40 odd years I think

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.540 
done for the last 40 odd years I think
that's<00:03:28.140> helped<00:03:28.470> me<00:03:28.590> keep<00:03:28.800> on<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
that's helped me keep on going and

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.810 
that's helped me keep on going and
probably<00:03:29.850> keep<00:03:30.330> my<00:03:30.390> times<00:03:30.840> down<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
probably keep my times down to the the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.540 
probably keep my times down to the the
goals<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.150> I've<00:03:33.360> had<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.590> various<00:03:35.100> 5k
