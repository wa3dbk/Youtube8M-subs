00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.250
 it's everyone that is to say that 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.560
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.169
 new meech video on what little 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.940
 black ops on a ryd act so everything 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.110
 first you will start to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.280
 lock the zombie by doing 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 change of weapons and stab wounds 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.640
 once that makes you go you 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.070
 to go to a place where I find myself 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.660
 to make the typhoon and as soon as you 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.610
 pass the fence you go two sides 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 and you will end up on sulik 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.480
 awesome incivilities once deviating 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.460
 how are you going to do how the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.110
 video help you try in some 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.500
 kind of good you go to the shade at 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.570
 ovm pass that will be where there where 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.219
 the zombies are going well buggy and it's 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
 with the person who will start this 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.790
 place there that you can do some 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.430
 machines armin jans board at the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.530
 person who is in white to happen to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.030
 this peak the invincibility at least the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.710
 person in white attracts more the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.930
 zombies at least my other players 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.860
 will be even more invincible so you 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.690
 go find a branch 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.590
 find once you're going to see 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.360
 barbed wire 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.860
 you have a tulle body and for 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.799
 to fall on a barrier just below 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 once you have retreated and you 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.470
 have fallen back on a screen a little more 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.210
 down the glitch will be successful so for 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.240
 well you spot you are just fine 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.180
 watch it's towards the end of the end 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.159
 it's towards the edge and it's also at 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.670
 where the wires are 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.220
 barbed wire 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.020
 a little rusty so here I am going to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 show you have to go well 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.369
 place there where the barbed wire dog 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 a kind of little bug we saw you 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.700
 with a big zoom and once you 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.590
 see them see the barbed wire 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.979
 like that well all the zombies of a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.170
 left you thrush like these in the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.729
 video so that's crazy because 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170
 there zombies that shows one over 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.630
 the other and when 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.210
 they all at the same time and all that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.069
 made big bugs and they go up frees 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.380
 old rhÃ´ne so that's funny x 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.150
 2 x reasons to see zombies that bug 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.170
 and once you are well placed 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 like that and that I advise them that the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.600
 person in white put themselves in saly gyan 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.170
 ability and beats all other players 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.330
 Of the game 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.459
 I advise them to put themselves in the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.040
 toll box we will need active links 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.480
 and electricity is activated every 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.430
 teleporters to be able to go from one 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.050
 pay pack but once that's done 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.260
 you will see in the video that I have 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.049
 improved the wonder why lepic laser and 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.690
 my famous 12 passes that I love 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.280
 more than anything and when I could see my 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.900
 crystal friend is placed in glee 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.730
 germain sibilance and all the zombies 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 jean dauguet may have this little 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.819
 barrier and we are no longer at nothing 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.739
 it so I advise you to put some 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.090
 nonsense she stuff like that for at 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.610
 chaos if he is a zombie who comes or 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.310
 not but he if you are really good 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.319
 stuck against the 15000 punchpunch 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.019
 will come if nature zombies you 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.880
 it is inevitably that you are not therefore 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 not that apple I think as long as you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.140
 are at the bottom of the paka punch 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.970
 fifteen friends will come to attack us so 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.340
 I think we had the round 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.320
 25 Indeed, by the handle but I you 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.090
 really advises to slip and 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.380
 now reminded us of a show 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.019
 like every click 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.730
 there you just have to go from there 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.680
 buy or otherwise you'll just have to 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.989
 improve your weapons because I 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.959
 I ended up on nolwenn leroy yves and 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.489
 I will take it and as I could see I 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.230
 had ammo a forehand 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.209
 so I really hope it forces 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.190
 you will be pleased do not hesitate to tell me 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.269
 on which maps would you like me 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.400
 shows you how to make penguins 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.640
 does not finish you want a lot of the function 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.010
 shangri la and moon after 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.370
 ra based on the comments on 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.020
 this video and that's how we could 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.060
 see quietly we can finish the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.319
 sleeve and you really take it 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.920
 a lot a lot of eat 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.780
 quietly 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.120
 so for me that his best big 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.470
 ed wright to make sleeves or 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.400
 rather the best technique for 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.709
 make sunday 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 and so that's the blick is coming to an end 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.040
 I hope you will have some more 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.360
 to let go of a little green thumb and a 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.160
 comment and I tell you to very 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.910
 soon for a new video of 8 and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.300
