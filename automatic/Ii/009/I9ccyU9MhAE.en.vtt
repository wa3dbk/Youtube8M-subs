this is the same engine is bad company
right<00:02:20.810> yeah<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.860> built<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.340> cross

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
right yeah so this is built on a cross

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.199 
right yeah so this is built on a cross
bad<00:02:22.820> engine

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.050 

and<00:02:26.209> we've<00:02:27.049> done<00:02:27.230> some<00:02:27.640> optimizations<00:02:28.640> about

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
and we've done some optimizations about

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.069 
and we've done some optimizations about
fixing<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:31.040> our<00:02:31.220> ferry<00:02:31.459> now<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:32.750> we

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
fixing so it's our ferry now but we

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.360 
fixing so it's our ferry now but we
don't<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.530> huge<00:02:33.890> changes<00:02:34.250> we

there's nothing like this out there

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
there's nothing like this out there
there's<00:02:59.560> no<00:02:59.710> competition<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.460> like<00:03:01.150> a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
there's no competition really like a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.110 
there's no competition really like a
really<00:03:01.420> deep<00:03:01.660> shooter<00:03:01.960> so<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:03.700> need<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.940> see

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
really deep shooter so we need to see

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
really deep shooter so we need to see
her<00:03:04.240> it's<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.780> proper<00:03:05.110> shooter<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:05.620> not<00:03:05.830> it's

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
her it's a proper shooter it's not it's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.480 
her it's a proper shooter it's not it's
not<00:03:06.550> casual<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.300> not<00:03:07.450> stupid<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:09.280> deep

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
not casual it's not stupid it's a deep

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.270 
not casual it's not stupid it's a deep
sure<00:03:09.880> experience<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.680> smaller<00:03:11.800> scale

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
sure experience but in a smaller scale

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.910 
sure experience but in a smaller scale
basically<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.480> all<00:03:13.660> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.320> vehicles<00:03:14.680> are

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
basically so all kind of vehicles are

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.210 
basically so all kind of vehicles are
represented<00:03:15.580> they're<00:03:16.570> not<00:03:16.690> all<00:03:16.750> tanks<00:03:17.740> jeeps

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
represented they're not all tanks jeeps

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.200 
represented they're not all tanks jeeps
boats<00:03:19.000> planes<00:03:20.400> specifically<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.490> planes<00:03:21.820> I

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
boats planes specifically the planes I

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.680 
boats planes specifically the planes I
can<00:03:22.450> show<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:23.970> question<00:03:24.970> beef<00:03:25.120> too<00:03:25.450> with

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
can show you that question beef too with

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.870 
can show you that question beef too with
the<00:03:25.840> Jets<00:03:26.080> wasn't<00:03:26.530> really<00:03:26.860> suited<00:03:27.460> for<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.790> a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the Jets wasn't really suited for in a

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.960 
the Jets wasn't really suited for in a
dog<00:03:28.090> fight<00:03:28.120> in<00:03:28.630> air<00:03:28.840> combat<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:30.460> now<00:03:30.610> we're

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
dog fight in air combat and now we're

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.059 
dog fight in air combat and now we're
back<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
back to that and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.160 
back to that and
it's<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.609> delicate<00:03:34.969> balance<00:03:34.999> you<00:03:35.480> know<00:03:35.599> how<00:03:36.109> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
it's a delicate balance you know how the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.220 
it's a delicate balance you know how the
controls<00:03:36.620> work<00:03:36.890> west<00:03:37.849> plains<00:03:38.299> by<00:03:38.689> nature<00:03:39.079> or

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
controls work west plains by nature or

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.879 
controls work west plains by nature or
pretty<00:03:39.560> complex<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:42.230> can<00:03:42.409> request<00:03:42.590> them

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
pretty complex so you can request them

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.489 
pretty complex so you can request them
some<00:03:43.340> training<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.939> be<00:03:44.060> good<00:03:44.209> at<00:03:44.329> it<00:03:44.480> once<00:03:45.290> you

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:45.499 
some training to be good at it once you

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:53.360 
some training to be good at it once you
know<00:03:45.650> your<00:03:45.920> internal<00:03:46.579> flying<00:03:46.939> is<00:03:47.239> really

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.490 

so<00:03:54.370> we're<00:03:54.489> having<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.879> bayonet<00:03:55.480> are<00:03:55.719> nice<00:03:56.049> you

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
so we're having a bayonet are nice you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.280 
so we're having a bayonet are nice you
have<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.829> wrench<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:58.109> specifically<00:03:59.109> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
have the wrench and specifically the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.440 
have the wrench and specifically the
Japanese<00:03:59.709> Scout<00:03:59.980> has<00:04:00.969> a<00:04:01.000> katana<00:04:02.939> there<00:04:03.939> we<00:04:04.060> go

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.849 

you<00:04:07.450> just<00:04:07.629> sneak<00:04:07.810> up<00:04:07.959> behind<00:04:07.989> people<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.680> waste

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
you just sneak up behind people to waste

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.039 
you just sneak up behind people to waste
that<00:04:09.069> one<00:04:09.310> here<00:04:09.609> but<00:04:10.390> they're<00:04:10.420> also<00:04:10.629> another

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
that one here but they're also another

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.509 
that one here but they're also another
feature<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.560> we<00:04:11.739> added<00:04:11.769> now<00:04:12.159> that<00:04:12.400> we

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
feature that we added now that we

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.940 
feature that we added now that we
haven't<00:04:12.849> had<00:04:13.090> an<00:04:13.239> NFL<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.780> game<00:04:13.959> before<00:04:14.319> and

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
haven't had an NFL to game before and

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
haven't had an NFL to game before and
that's<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> air<00:04:15.609> raid<00:04:15.849> Bombur<00:04:20.729> see<00:04:21.729> here

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
that's the air raid Bombur see here

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.030 
that's the air raid Bombur see here
actually<00:04:22.210> there<00:04:22.870> is

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.600 

so<00:04:30.610> what<00:04:30.760> happens<00:04:31.180> gameplay-wise<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.410> that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
so what happens gameplay-wise is that

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.940 
so what happens gameplay-wise is that
you<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:33.790> enter<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.480> bunker<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:35.830> have

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
you can enter this bunker and we have

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.370 
you can enter this bunker and we have
one<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.280> these<00:04:36.430> on<00:04:36.910> each<00:04:37.090> level<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:38.080> when<00:04:38.290> you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
one of these on each level and when you

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.170 
one of these on each level and when you
do<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:38.950> basically<00:04:39.130> lock<00:04:39.550> yourself<00:04:39.940> into

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
do that you basically lock yourself into

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
do that you basically lock yourself into
the<00:04:40.420> bandits<00:04:40.780> know<00:04:40.930> what<00:04:41.080> can<00:04:41.200> kill<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:42.000> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
the bandits know what can kill you and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.050 
the bandits know what can kill you and
basically<00:04:44.200> your<00:04:44.530> radio<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.100> an<00:04:45.310> air<00:04:45.460> strike<00:04:45.490> an

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
basically your radio in an air strike an

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.900 
basically your radio in an air strike an
air<00:04:46.270> bomb<00:04:46.540> squad<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.170> you<00:04:48.100> have<00:04:48.250> limited

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
air bomb squad and you have limited

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.390 
air bomb squad and you have limited
controls<00:04:49.300> over<00:04:49.600> how<00:04:49.720> they<00:04:49.870> work<00:04:50.080> how<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:51.100> fly

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
controls over how they work how to fly

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.210 
controls over how they work how to fly
and<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.000> just<00:04:52.210> pick<00:04:52.480> one<00:04:52.690> target<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.320> carpet

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
and you just pick one target and carpet

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.490 
and you just pick one target and carpet
it<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.610> kill<00:04:54.760> everything<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.300> your<00:04:55.390> way<00:04:55.600> let's

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
it and kill everything in your way let's

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.010 
it and kill everything in your way let's
see<00:04:56.650> if<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.860> can<00:04:57.420> manage<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.510> get<00:04:58.630> into<00:04:58.870> one<00:04:58.990> of

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
see if I can manage to get into one of

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.310 
see if I can manage to get into one of
these

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.270 

so<00:05:06.190> there's<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:07.260> time<00:05:08.260> out<00:05:08.470> between<00:05:08.770> bomb

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
so there's a time out between bomb

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.820 
so there's a time out between bomb
breaks<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.730> can't<00:05:09.970> just<00:05:10.150> spam<00:05:10.510> bomber's<00:05:11.050> to

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
breaks you can't just spam bomber's to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.720 
breaks you can't just spam bomber's to
need<00:05:11.980> to<00:05:12.100> wait<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> bit<00:05:12.430> before<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:15.520> now<00:05:15.670> I'm

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
need to wait a bit before it so now I'm

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.490 
need to wait a bit before it so now I'm
spawning<00:05:16.180> into<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.600> bomb<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.290> bomber

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
spawning into the bomb the bomber

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.750 
spawning into the bomb the bomber
squadron<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:19.960> can<00:05:20.110> since<00:05:21.040> I<00:05:21.100> also<00:05:21.280> limited

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
squadron so I can since I also limited

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.240 
squadron so I can since I also limited
steering<00:05:22.420> I<00:05:22.600> can<00:05:23.200> basically<00:05:23.350> pick<00:05:23.710> one<00:05:23.950> spot

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
steering I can basically pick one spot

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.420 
steering I can basically pick one spot
and<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:25.000> want<00:05:25.210> our<00:05:25.420> pets<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.840> drop<00:05:26.430> Michaels

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
and I want our pets to drop Michaels

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.940 
and I want our pets to drop Michaels
change<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.880> view<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:28.840> see<00:05:29.050> where<00:05:29.830> I'm

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
change the view so I see where I'm

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.110 
change the view so I see where I'm
aiming

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:50.999 

second<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.870> carpet<00:05:35.290> bomb<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.680> beach

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.930 

lumps<00:05:51.699> away

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.030 

then<00:05:57.450> while<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.780> bomber's<00:05:58.140> up<00:05:58.290> in<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.500> air<00:05:58.650> is

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
then while the bomber's up in the air is

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.160 
then while the bomber's up in the air is

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
the siren going on in on the island so

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.780 
the siren going on in on the island so
