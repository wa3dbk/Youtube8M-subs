00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.589
 hello and welcome to one 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:15.470
 small test of me the jazz and me 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:18.990
 test the zulu dj system today 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.119
 it is published by video chat that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 also gives this software away 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.369
 I'll show you how to handle it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.369
 or something and then we can start 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 First, we have the volume here 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.720
 We can start short states 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.010
 that is very loud you can understand with 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.060
 to quieten down to 1 that fits 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 we even do the other thing first 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.330
 quieter so that you can beautiful women 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.140
 if you make everything up my 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.140
 I somehow funny 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.350
 So I have it easier mega 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 houses 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 then just a little bit that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:14.880
 different faster and slower 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:20.880
 my house has to be there just so that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:30.149
 we can leave Heiko times choral 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:33.710
 It's not so good when you do it 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.710
 this double effect by choir 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.770
 short a shirt 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.359
 so that was clear out there clear here 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.219
 it to the playlist, of course 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.939
 Compressor makes it all up 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.130
 a little louder a little louder 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.890
 delay I do not know that that sounds 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.890
 also shit finds 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:19.390
 then let's start that here 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:24.040
 we mix here with beautiful 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.459
 the bar looks like that will be both 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.620
 noisy noisy so you can hear that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 so that angle louder 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.040
 and how one can protect the space 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.659
 right we stay at the left first 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.659
 the background music is percussion or 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:53.379
 microphones probably back at the moment so 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:57.790
 I have to drink something sore for a short time 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:02.019
 Label correct smooth is mine 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:07.650
 it's your fault if you go swimming but it is 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.650
 Just a little bit to the right 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.050
 so again say a complete because it 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.050
 even louder 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.460
 so here it flashes as you can see it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.340
 that in the end then you can get the idea 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.020
 Of course it can also go on 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.120
 and must decide our fucking 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.980
 then we'll see, we can still 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.390
 another they make three 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.270
 drop dead i said nee pattinson 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.660
 I think if you can not 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.660
 fast forward 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.620
 this is not music so that's all here 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.880
 come to wholegrain or so autoplay 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:47.200
 hint at that here underplay then 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.060
 and the labels under the volk ​​screen 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.130
 delay us and it has to be qi though 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.700
 but I am also holy now 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.430
 met 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:02.740
 here comes the speed 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.740
 convert additionally connects 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:11.960
 we can not do class we have to 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.930
 but in any case it was 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.080
 that and my side I still bring 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.150
 another one is coming soon 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.960
 and saw some other software 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.160
 I'll show you everything then say 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.080
 I'll go and see puhdys ladies and see you 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.080
 next time
