00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 Note that the width is much sucking feng shui interior 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 The feng shui interior is therefore placed on the desk 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:19.050
 It's better to zoom in and hold it on the left side 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.560
 Well, I tried to arrange the desk as I worked through the almost-in- the-way. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.710
 Bed 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.780
 Let's see the discharge China 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.910
 We place attention in the middle of the room closing work 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:40.030
 good 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:46.330
 The bed is usually 1100 mm in width from the first mm 2000 mm in length 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.330
 It uses a lot of single size beds of 2100 mm 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.240
 When placing the bed in the center of the wall 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.310
 There should be no space between the desk and the bed, 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.540
 I will 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:07.450
 And place the bookshelf near the desk. 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:12.460
 It is recommended to minimize movement 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.540
 That strategic plan presented by the desk and bed position, and color now 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.590
 I did it. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.509
 Now, let's try to touch the last 5 points more than the last one . 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.909
 I'll do it 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:27.250
 When placing sheets to be built 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:30.330
 Placing orders to catch value by measuring the distance between the wall and the door 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 Desirable. 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:41.200
 With sufficient space to avoid the inconvenience when the width forgot to open the door, the window closes 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:46.210
 Locate and position 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.899
 If you do not have enough space to expand the color and bed position and take full advantage of the space 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.939
 silver 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:57.069
 Uh that now handle such Sanger than any national captain planned in the room 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:02:01.479
 It is better to push the efficiency of utilization of space by space 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.689
 Now, with the CAD work, I got caught in the rare work bread. 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.259
 That caught Reyes 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.799
 I'll see more of it through the printer. 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.220
 Certainly used in the case of defense dentistry 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:21.760
 The other three students in a long place, such as the use of space in the chart space 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.870
 We recommend securing storage space 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.730
 Let's find out about deadlines in the study room on the basis of smiley laughs. 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.709
 I'll do it 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:37.690
 The most commonly used finishing materials for the nine rooms are the wallpaper 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.190
 If such a wall and a thousand is a kind of a little eojjina combine the physical eager Kutsu 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.349
 I use it a lot. 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.319
 In the case of flooring , the contents of the natural materials alone will use a large squadron 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:53.019
 Let's try to select a wallpaper. 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:55.660
 Now I see some primitive colors of this kind of 4, 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.750
 It is better to avoid 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.140
 3 This is more than perfect 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.140
 bloke 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.980
 You can choose these brown-type blades that can give you some stability 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.390
 good 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.550
 Ondol flooring as a flooring, Romano because it is generally felt unity 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 It allows you to batch 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:24.910
 I recommend you see a choice here Well there next to the a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.400
 Players have dark colors, such as light colors and jets 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:35.980
 When the Straight color and write a word to the flooring may look space narrowing 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:41.380
 Choose a similar wallpaper to make it stronger physically 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 Now, there are two colors for the color and the floor of the wallpaper we chose. 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.980
 Now, this is not a student, depending on individual rooms gives good the difference in brightness of some 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.620
 It was. 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:58.780
 The ultimate bread is a durable, 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:04.780
 It is better to construct it considering the possibility of change rather than 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:10.450
 If you use the color immediately before the sea bloom, the atmosphere is totally submerged and space 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:15.750
 Because it looks narrow, I use a bright color, and I feel the overall feeling 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.750
 You can have an effect that gives you a wider space. 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:26.610
 Even if you are tired , you can see narrow space in which you will use dark color. 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.020
 So you can give a stable river and garage at the same time, 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.729
 using 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.729
 It is advisable to decorate so that you can have a sense of touching through the floor 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.729
 Ah 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:50.690
 Three months of good luck with my home country may look good and frustrating. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:54.870
 Overall, the atmosphere is refined to suit that contains What phase of the clean image 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.400

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.760
 Oo 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.730
 In the case of hair loss, the interior is tailored to the overall atmosphere 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.590
 White gives a clean image 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:23.210
 I do not like the atmosphere on the rock, so I choose the brown color 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.240
 Disposition and relief 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.240
 5 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:36.520
 Once the floor, wallpaper, and eye color are determined 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:41.599
 The world of determination is determined The furniture can match the overall bright atmosphere 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.349
