00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.580
 the process until you get here in my hair 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.870
 I was in heat now, so guys 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.110
 start we will need one or bo is 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.390
 That's when we'll use the whole egg, then. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.069
 select a glass pot or 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.810
 plastic that is where they will most mix the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.790
 cream place the egg inside and now with 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.130
 a plastic smith spoon I'm going to take 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.230
 this little white screen that has 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:53.290
 new that she who smells then shot 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:55.690
 all that whiter little screen there 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.370
 along with the egg I'll put two 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.959
 tablespoons of a cream of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.989
 I'm going to use the one that is a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.910
 ginger organics cream it's a 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 Delight but you can use what you 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.870
 you have at home, no problem 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.310
 I want to put two spoons full 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.329
 I'm using another spoon is not the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.329
 same as I left the egg 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.400
 Now, move well, move well, everything will be fine. 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.410
 mixed dinho 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.020
 when you see that everything is mixed 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.150
 and that you thus pass the spoon in the bottom 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.440
 it already begins to look like a 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.580
 glass is because it is already good and the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.840
 his person will be so soft 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.840
 but it is the ideal for us to spend in our hair 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.700
 How can you see my hair from the series? 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.550
 wet I let him dry one 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.670
 A little bit of cream and I did it. 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.500
 this way to dry and with the towel only 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.350
 for those who do not have any friction and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:20.459
 I thought I'll use three daughters and you? 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.459
 Can you use it when you're at home? 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:34.630
 I started separating the hair in two 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:38.710
 parts and did not stay with smell and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.720
 delicious scent either I used it by 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.660
 getting more or less two mechinhas 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.600
 My little fingers and I'm going to 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.820
 they started to leave 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.850
 Let's do this massage and massage. 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.690
 hydration even makes about a few 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:04.750
 20 times in each mechinha cream penetrate 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:08.520
 well, and then I did it 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.520
 the whole underside of the hair 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.380
 now that top part I selected in 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.620
 two parts and I'll do the same thing 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.590
 I'll pass the cream and marchinhas for more. 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.000
 or two little fingers and let's react to 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.000
 20 times less each 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.229
 so I finished the last match of 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.820
 yesterday and it was sliding in the hair only that 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:45.430
 because I did not leave the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.139
 before implantation and with 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.550
 excess of the team that is in the paint goal 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.740
 passing in the root because I do not 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.960
 I passed the prize in the root by the root is 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.550
 very valuable and then you can use the 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.050
 own success that is in the try and 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.630
 pass the root 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.630
 I've done this whole hair process 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.560
 I want to learn my hair back in 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.729
 time that the lines that stayed here in 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.860
 everything back and I will involve in 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.370
 all my hair one piece of paper 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.360
 making aluminum helmet 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.580
 making a touch but if you have 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.240
 thermal cap also suits and he got 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.240
 thus 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:33.430
 I 'll go until Friday for the stocking for a 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:37.020
 minute with dryer and leave the cream 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.020
 agenda in hair for 30 minutes 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.510
 soon after she saw the hair I 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.199
 I thought he was all very fine. 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.930
 stay tight and straight 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.300
 dry slightly natural 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.250
 after I let it get a little natural 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.780
 fast dryer but before 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.849
 protect the wires and I thought 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.889
 ally and with the help of this 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.750
 comb I know he 's fast I did not 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.400
 brush or anything only you catch it not 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.669
 get wet and show results to 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.669
 you 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.830
 and I gave when commenting the discolored 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.180
 when I just pass a dryer and 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.550
 dolphins now he talks a little bit 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.560
 armed because it was very dry and this 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.960
 time after the hydration he stayed 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.630
 it seems that it was not so softly 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.310
 proud and president got more trash 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.800
 because I did not do it or did 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.240
 brush only if there is one who chooses 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.470
