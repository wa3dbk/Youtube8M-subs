00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
I mean that's about the equivalent of I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.630 
I mean that's about the equivalent of I
think<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.060> steak<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.840> even<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.470> pork<00:01:26.189> chops<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
think a steak or even like pork chops so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
think a steak or even like pork chops so
I<00:01:26.700> mean<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> bad<00:01:27.630> food<00:01:28.020> source

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
