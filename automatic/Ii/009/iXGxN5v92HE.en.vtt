the river on Monday and told me the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
the river on Monday and told me the
water<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:11.159> powerful<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.330> looks<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
water is more powerful than it looks and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
water is more powerful than it looks and
the<00:01:13.830> currency<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> God<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.490> always<00:01:14.850> remember

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the currency of God just always remember

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.280 
the currency of God just always remember
the<00:01:15.270> currents<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.659> stronger<00:01:16.049> than<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> think

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the currents are stronger than you think

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
the currents are stronger than you think
they're<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.070> talked<00:01:17.280> about

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
they're going to be like we talked about

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
they're going to be like we talked about
up<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.970> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> big<00:01:18.720> boils<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
up there with kind of the big boils and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.289 
up there with kind of the big boils and
the<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.009> separate<00:01:20.310> currents<00:01:20.670> those<00:01:21.180> are

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the you know separate currents those are

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
the you know separate currents those are
a<00:01:21.330> lot<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.479> powerful<00:01:21.930> than<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.640> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a lot more powerful than they look and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
a lot more powerful than they look and
so<00:01:24.420> getting<00:01:24.960> across<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> river<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.650> only<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so getting across the river not only is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
so getting across the river not only is
it<00:01:25.979> probably<00:01:26.369> further<00:01:26.580> than<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
it probably further than you think but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.240 
it probably further than you think but
when<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> currents<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.070> fighting

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
when the currents going to be fighting

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
when the currents going to be fighting
against<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> an<00:01:29.880> eddy<00:01:30.060> line<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.509> something

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
against you an eddy line or something

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
against you an eddy line or something
like<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.829> harder<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like that it's really a lot harder it's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.890 
like that it's really a lot harder it's
not<00:01:32.400> swimming<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> pool<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.630> life

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
not swimming in a pool so with my life

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
not swimming in a pool so with my life
jacket<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.829> decided<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.030> how

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
powerful the water is by swimming across

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
powerful the water is by swimming across
with<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> team<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> course<00:01:40.049> watching<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.770> for

me<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:41.970> three<00:01:42.420> quarters<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> way

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

and<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:43.950> sucked<00:01:44.280> under<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.970> small

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and I'm sucked under by a small

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.139 
and I'm sucked under by a small
whirlpool<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.140> quickly<00:01:46.860> float<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
whirlpool I quickly float back up but I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
whirlpool I quickly float back up but I
have<00:01:48.329> very<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.960> control<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:49.920> using

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
have very little control and I'm using

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
have very little control and I'm using
all<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.729> strength<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.799> took

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
all of my strength to get back it took

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
all of my strength to get back it took
me<00:01:53.130> only<00:01:53.280> four<00:01:53.729> minutes<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.509> back<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
me only four minutes to go back and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.920 
me only four minutes to go back and
forth<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> felt<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.670> eternity

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
forth but it felt like an eternity

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.370 
forth but it felt like an eternity
that's<00:01:57.930> probably<00:01:59.450> one<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> hardest<00:02:00.960> swims

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that's probably one of the hardest swims
