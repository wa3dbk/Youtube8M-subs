00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to chew a stem I wanted to design a stem

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
to chew a stem I wanted to design a stem
that<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> had<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> classic<00:00:46.920> race<00:00:47.129> look

that was kind of had a classic race look
to<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.780> still<00:00:48.960> durable<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.010> know

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

street<00:00:50.460> abuse<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> jumping<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.050> anything

you<00:00:52.770> wanted<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> jump<00:00:53.309> down

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.370 

I<00:01:09.520> wanted<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.640> stim<00:01:10.910> that<00:01:11.090> was<00:01:11.210> bigger<00:01:12.080> than

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
I wanted a stim that was bigger than

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.810 
I wanted a stim that was bigger than
most<00:01:12.560> op<00:01:12.830> loads<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.400> made<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.670> eight

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
most op loads so we made it eight

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.580 
most op loads so we made it eight
millimeters<00:01:14.330> taller<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.080> extra<00:01:15.410> height

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
millimeters taller the extra height

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.170 
millimeters taller the extra height
allows<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.280> raise<00:01:16.520> your<00:01:16.550> bars<00:01:16.910> without

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
allows you to raise your bars without

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.410 
allows you to raise your bars without
adding<00:01:17.840> extra<00:01:18.020> spaces

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:43.779 

I<00:01:39.970> wanted<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.799> solid<00:01:42.799> bolts<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.700> you

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
I wanted to have solid bolts so that you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.130 
I wanted to have solid bolts so that you
wouldn't<00:01:44.060> break<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.659> while<00:01:44.930> you're<00:01:45.080> out

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
wouldn't break and while you're out

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.350 
wouldn't break and while you're out
riding<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.619> doing<00:01:46.009> bigger<00:01:46.220> drops<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.909> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
riding and doing bigger drops and the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.210 
riding and doing bigger drops and the
bolts<00:01:47.659> are<00:01:47.750> actually<00:01:48.110> longer<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:48.710> well<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.159> you

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
bolts are actually longer as well so you

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.770 
bolts are actually longer as well so you
don't<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.820> worry<00:01:50.030> about<00:01:50.090> pulling<00:01:50.659> them

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
don't have to worry about pulling them

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.969 
don't have to worry about pulling them
through<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.049> bottom<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.500> stem<00:01:51.740> when

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
through the bottom of the stem when

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:12.030 
through the bottom of the stem when
tightening

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.589 

and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:14.170> truth<00:02:14.409> stem<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.860> 11<00:02:15.250> ounces<00:02:15.580> as<00:02:15.939> a<00:02:15.970> 53

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
and the truth stem is 11 ounces as a 53

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.660 
and the truth stem is 11 ounces as a 53
millimeter<00:02:17.049> reach<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.739> 33<00:02:18.099> millimeter

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
millimeter reach and a 33 millimeter

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:46.289 
millimeter reach and a 33 millimeter
rise

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.299 

Wow
