yes<00:04:50.570> like<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.660> said<00:04:51.900> earlier<00:04:52.260> I'm<00:04:52.669> it's<00:04:53.669> May<00:04:53.940> 3rd

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
yes like I said earlier I'm it's May 3rd

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.020 
yes like I said earlier I'm it's May 3rd
I<00:04:54.690> usually<00:04:55.500> plan<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.919> my<00:04:56.040> stuff<00:04:56.310> in<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.790> March

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
I usually plan on my stuff in the March

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.590 
I usually plan on my stuff in the March
1st<00:04:57.840> April<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:59.370> it's<00:04:59.580> May<00:04:59.730> 3rd<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.270> I'm<00:05:00.390> just

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
1st April and it's May 3rd and I'm just

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.810 
1st April and it's May 3rd and I'm just
not<00:05:00.810> planting<00:05:01.260> we<00:05:01.710> also<00:05:01.860> had<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.250> pretty<00:05:02.550> late

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
not planting we also had a pretty late

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.120 
not planting we also had a pretty late
winter<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.780> it's<00:05:04.440> probably<00:05:04.740> best<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.040> I

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
winter so it's probably best that I

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.550 
winter so it's probably best that I
didn't<00:05:05.400> plant<00:05:05.610> early<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.120> year<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:07.530> uh

didn't plant early this year but uh

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.820 
didn't plant early this year but uh
