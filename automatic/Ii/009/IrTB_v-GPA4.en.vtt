group for the purposes of this demo I'm
going<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.520> use<00:02:10.729> code<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.390> move<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.750> appearance

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
going to use code to move the appearance

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.990 
going to use code to move the appearance
page<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.890> bottom<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.610> construction

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
page to the bottom of the construction

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.690 
page to the bottom of the construction
group<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.600> close<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> wizard<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
group I close the wizard and the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.470 
group I close the wizard and the
application<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.880> return<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.360> visual<00:02:17.480> studio

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.440 

any<00:02:21.110> event<00:02:21.530> handler<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.950> create<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> new<00:02:22.970> list<00:02:23.209> of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
any event handler I create a new list of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.220 
any event handler I create a new list of
type<00:02:23.810> wizard<00:02:24.470> page

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.800 

it's<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.190> populated<00:02:29.879> with<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> pages<00:02:30.360> from

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's then populated with the pages from

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's then populated with the pages from
the<00:02:30.900> construction<00:02:31.440> group<00:02:31.830> I'm<00:02:32.069> using<00:02:32.970> index

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the construction group I'm using index

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.899 
the construction group I'm using index
zero<00:02:33.840> because<00:02:34.409> construction<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.610> first

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
zero because construction was the first

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.360 
zero because construction was the first
group<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.810> wizard

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.640 

then<00:02:42.060> i<00:02:42.180> create<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.599> wizard<00:02:43.110> page<00:02:43.349> and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
then i create a wizard page and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.619 
then i create a wizard page and
initialize<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> second<00:02:45.180> page<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
initialize it to the second page of the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.250 
initialize it to the second page of the
construction<00:02:45.989> group<00:02:46.379> hence<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.250> index<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.879> I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
construction group hence the index one I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.480 
construction group hence the index one I
remove<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.440> appearance<00:02:49.860> page<00:02:50.129> from<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.580> list

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.840 

and<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:56.240> add<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.660> again<00:02:57.490> since<00:02:58.490> this<00:02:58.610> isn't

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
and I add it again since this isn't

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.450 
and I add it again since this isn't
being<00:02:59.180> sorted<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.900> any<00:03:00.110> special<00:03:00.470> way<00:03:00.710> the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
being sorted in any special way the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.950 
being sorted in any special way the
newly<00:03:01.760> added<00:03:01.940> appearance<00:03:02.450> page<00:03:02.720> will

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
newly added appearance page will

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.750 
newly added appearance page will
automatically<00:03:03.590> end<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> last<00:03:04.490> item

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
automatically end up as the last item

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.420 
automatically end up as the last item
within<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.420> construction<00:03:05.960> group

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
within the construction group

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.449 
within the construction group
finally<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.540> set<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.079> pages<00:03:09.500> collection<00:03:10.010> equal

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
finally I set the pages collection equal

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.009 
finally I set the pages collection equal
to<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.700> list<00:03:10.939> I<00:03:11.090> created<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.750> modified

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
to the list I created and modified

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.480 
to the list I created and modified
earlier

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.940 

and<00:03:15.580> I'm<00:03:16.240> done<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.630> run<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.080> application<00:03:17.230> again

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and I'm done I run the application again

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.040 
and I'm done I run the application again
to<00:03:18.160> see<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> results<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.150> click<00:03:19.570> on<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.810> button

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
to see the results I click on the button

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.440 
to see the results I click on the button
again<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.470> invoke<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.010> chart<00:03:21.250> wizard<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.760> now

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
again to invoke the chart wizard and now

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.140 
again to invoke the chart wizard and now
you<00:03:23.080> can<00:03:23.290> see<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.980> appearance<00:03:24.520> page<00:03:24.910> has

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you can see that the appearance page has

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.940 
you can see that the appearance page has
been<00:03:25.300> moved<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.840> bottom<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.440> items<00:03:26.770> in
