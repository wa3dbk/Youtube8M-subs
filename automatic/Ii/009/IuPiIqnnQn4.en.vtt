00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.950
 it was hard to imagine 20 years ago that 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.869
 Korean cars will collect in 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.880
 Europe and now the kia leadership 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.220
 declares that they create new standards 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.660
 quality for the old world is of course 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.270
 hard to believe but still let's 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.779
 let's see how and most importantly who collects these 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.779
 by car 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.120
 the first thing that catches the eye inside 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 perfect clean floors at the factory 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.810
 Slovak lived unreal shine such 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.400
 do not always meet a fashionable hotel 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.320
 or say the hospital 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.260
 and we were assured that by the arrival not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 prepared and such an atmosphere here always 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 explain it like this will not be 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.059
 order will not be quality 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 and this is followed as closely as possible. 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.380
 intently talking about walking on each 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 assembly stage all cars pass 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.080
 quality control starting with bodywork 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.910
 workshops 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.010
 there we check the details on the outside 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.080
 defects look welding seams 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 perhaps most of all the work comes 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.300
 at the assembly shop because at the end of the line before 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.250
 We have already finished the car but before 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.500
 how it will be delivered to the owner 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 make sure that there are no visuals 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.530
 and hidden defects take for example 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 body shop two lines of pressing parts 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 process 5400 then metal per year volume 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.190
 colossal but if necessary 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.260
 the conveyor can be reconfigured to release 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.330
 other details in just 20 minutes 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.280
 The first two panels will be checked by laser and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.290
 if everything is ok, they will start the cars on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.790
 total power in total here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.009
 342 robots are installed against control 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500
 qualities are always involved and ludy 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.119
 and these are our best employees even there 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.770
 where checks are performed by robots 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.560
 human participation is still necessary 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 to drive maintain these machines and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.909
 process the data we choose the most 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.539
 qualified employees are ours 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.850
 know-how 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.219
 even the drivers who test the car 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.490
 after assembly all first-class 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.920
 paint shop and assembly drivers 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.079
 engines we were not allowed to find found 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 several secrets of technology at once 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.070
 security considerations so we 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 immediately set off the biggest and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.039
 probably an interesting room of the factory shop 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.780
 assembly 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.910
 load of employees seems 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.940
 inhuman conveyor speed one 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.310
 car per minute 1350 cars per day 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.980
 and sends various models spoiling 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 venga picking options also rights to 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.650
 there is essentially no error otherwise everything will rise 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 production 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.750
 the most important qualities for our 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.260
 employees especially on conveyor 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.420
 lines 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.300
 this is the ability to work with your hands because 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.490
 they pass 60 cars an hour the second 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.470
 this is the desire to do quality 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.930
 products pay attention to the most 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 minor trifles and of course 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.540
 education is also a mandatory item 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.520
 the most amazing thing is that these people are still 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.890
 somehow managed to smile noticing the camera 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 and greet us all local 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.730
 residents consider the work at the factory very 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.650
 prestigious salary is above average 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.600
 country and competition respectively in place 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.220
 big truth of some specialists 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.910
 Koreans still have to hire 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.739
 from abroad where the robot robot can 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.870
 put to perform the same 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.980
 actions but at the same time behind the car 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.590
 you must always follow 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.180
 if there is any problem to 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 the same they need to be customized and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.290
 program such specialists 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.840
 by the way is quite difficult to find on our 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.370
 job market 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.379
 try to train staff and 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.490
 independently arrange open days 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.470
 Doors workshops and practices 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.910
 well about this room to work perhaps 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.010
 most attentive most responsible 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.780
 factory workers after all 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.160
 it is these people who depend on how they 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.310
 meet your car future 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.310
 owner 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.640
 water test, hermetic sealed light 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.440
 on cosmetic defects 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.660
 check electrical test runs 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.120
 engine suspension and brake behavior 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.770
 at the landfill they are doing more 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.210
 three hundred sixty people that is 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.530
 ten percent of the total 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.810
 factory employees 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 these are Korean quality standards 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.470
 impressive and best of all 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.140
 most of these cars 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.700
 go where everything is right in Russia 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 our market priority 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.510
 and to operation in harsh environments like 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.510
 say in Kiev their products are ready
