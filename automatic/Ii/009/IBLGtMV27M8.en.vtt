00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
I started playing with this rat rod

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.690 
I started playing with this rat rod
project<00:00:06.569> here<00:00:08.389> as<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.570> can<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.929> I've<00:00:10.700> decided

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
project here as you can see I've decided

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.289 
project here as you can see I've decided
to<00:00:11.910> lengthen<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.660> about<00:00:13.460> two<00:00:14.460> feet<00:00:14.759> something

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
to lengthen it about two feet something

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.420 
to lengthen it about two feet something
like<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:17.480> started<00:00:18.480> putting<00:00:18.840> into<00:00:19.220> big<00:00:20.220> piece

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
like that started putting into big piece

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.590 
like that started putting into big piece
of<00:00:20.460> channel<00:00:21.000> iron<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> straighten

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
of channel iron here to straighten

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.720 
of channel iron here to straighten
extend<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> frame<00:00:27.619> I'll<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> had<00:00:29.279> Jack

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
extend the frame I'll be here I had Jack

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.319 
extend the frame I'll be here I had Jack
handle<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.300> put<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.130> just<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.279> clamp<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
handle I put in it just to clamp it in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.250 
handle I put in it just to clamp it in
and<00:00:33.600> kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.930> keep<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> straight<00:00:36.079> here<00:00:37.079> I've

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and kind of keep it straight here I've

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.280 
and kind of keep it straight here I've
just<00:00:37.559> welded<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.600> piece<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just welded it the first piece is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.920 
just welded it the first piece is
starting<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
starting on it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.240 
starting on it
it's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> lot<00:00:43.230> stronger<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> old

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's a lot stronger than the old

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.209 
it's a lot stronger than the old
original<00:00:44.520> frame<00:00:46.160> next<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.550> got<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.090> is

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
original frame next thing I got to do is

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.619 
original frame next thing I got to do is
maybe<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.520> make<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
maybe we would make sure I got all the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.310 
maybe we would make sure I got all the
right<00:00:52.410> distance<00:00:52.890> between<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.430> axles<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.320> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
right distance between my axles here and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
right distance between my axles here and
then<00:00:56.190> I'll<00:00:56.340> put<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.910> other<00:00:57.149> piece<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
then I'll put in this other piece and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
then I'll put in this other piece and
then<00:00:58.350> I'll<00:00:58.469> weld<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.280> solid<00:01:01.879> finally

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
then I'll weld it all up solid finally

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.100 
then I'll weld it all up solid finally
got<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.480> sorted<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:05.630> cut<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> right

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
got this all sorted out cut to the right

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.899 
got this all sorted out cut to the right

what's<00:01:33.009> counts<00:01:33.729> now<00:01:34.060> just<00:01:34.390> welded<00:01:34.780> up

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
what's counts now just welded up

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.660 
what's counts now just welded up
well<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:39.680> 110<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> half<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
well here we have 110 and a half and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
well here we have 110 and a half and
about<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.939> 15<00:01:44.630> inside<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.049> almost<00:01:47.240> 111<00:01:48.740> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
about a 15 inside we have almost 111 so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.749 
about a 15 inside we have almost 111 so
it's<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:51.770> looking<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.039> at<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> front<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
it's off looking here at the front of it

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.200 
it's off looking here at the front of it
from<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.950> rear<00:01:58.950> axle<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
from here to the rear axle back there is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
from here to the rear axle back there is
exactly<00:02:00.689> 108<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:04.159> from

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
exactly 108 and the same thing here from

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.720 
exactly 108 and the same thing here from
the<00:02:05.280> top<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> shock<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> axles<00:02:06.899> 108<00:02:08.929> so

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
the top of the shock to the axles 108 so

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.059 
the top of the shock to the axles 108 so
we've<00:02:11.730> got<00:02:12.410> about<00:02:13.410> an<00:02:13.590> inch<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> half<00:02:14.600> here

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
we've got about an inch and a half here

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.589 
we've got about an inch and a half here
yep<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:18.209> on<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.600> side<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:20.599> yeah

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
yep and on this side we have about yeah

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.949 
yep and on this side we have about yeah
so<00:02:22.760> only<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> move<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> quarter<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.870> an

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so only got to move it a quarter of an

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.320 
so only got to move it a quarter of an
inch<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.410> change<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.799> half<00:02:26.040> inch<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> front

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
inch to change a half inch and the front

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.199 
inch to change a half inch and the front
end<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.489> all<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.849> with<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
end so we can do all of that with the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.870 
end so we can do all of that with the
alignment<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.930> frame<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.410> straight<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.069> I'll

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
alignment the frame is straight so I'll

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.140 
alignment the frame is straight so I'll
just<00:02:33.239> go<00:02:33.390> ahead<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.750> roll<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.819> well<00:02:35.819> once

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
just go ahead and roll this up well once

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.770 
just go ahead and roll this up well once
we<00:02:36.299> get<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:36.660> tacked<00:02:37.019> up<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.540> won't

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
we get it all tacked up good so it won't

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.800 
we get it all tacked up good so it won't
work<00:02:41.840> pretty<00:02:42.840> much<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:45.060> these<00:02:45.299> different

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
work pretty much all these different

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.090 
work pretty much all these different
places<00:02:47.060> now<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.510> start<00:02:48.750> welding<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
places now we just start welding it and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.520 
places now we just start welding it and
it<00:02:50.280> should<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.640> straight<00:02:50.940> whenever<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.630> it's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it should be straight whenever it's it's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.720 
it should be straight whenever it's it's
done

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
done

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.920 
done
but<00:02:55.300> dollars<00:02:55.810> worth<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:57.300> fool<00:02:58.300> around<00:02:58.450> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
but dollars worth a fool around and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.000 
but dollars worth a fool around and
welding<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:01.989> pretty<00:03:02.200> much<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.770> all

Don<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:06.489> wheels<00:03:06.700> may<00:03:07.030> not<00:03:07.209> look<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.480> good<00:03:07.989> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
Don the wheels may not look that good a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.690 
Don the wheels may not look that good a
little<00:03:09.940> better<00:03:10.150> picture<00:03:10.420> here<00:03:11.670> they're<00:03:12.670> not

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
little better picture here they're not

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.800 
little better picture here they're not
that<00:03:13.030> clean<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:17.940> plenty<00:03:18.940> hot<00:03:19.180> got<00:03:19.569> good

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
that clean but they plenty hot got good

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.690 
that clean but they plenty hot got good
penetration<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.720> that's<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.890> main<00:03:24.370> thing

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
penetration and that's the main thing

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.270 
penetration and that's the main thing
here<00:03:25.000> what<00:03:25.510> I'll<00:03:25.660> do<00:03:25.930> is

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.750 

what<00:03:29.850> I'll<00:03:30.000> do<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.240> here<00:03:30.569> it'll<00:03:30.840> take<00:03:31.110> some

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
what I'll do is here it'll take some

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.490 
what I'll do is here it'll take some
flee<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.180> played<00:03:33.450> over<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.720> outside<00:03:34.260> of

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
flee and played over the outside of

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.800 
flee and played over the outside of
these<00:03:36.230> make<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.260> even<00:03:37.709> stronger<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:39.420> inside<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
these make it even stronger the inside I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.050 
these make it even stronger the inside I
don't<00:03:40.170> care<00:03:40.440> about<00:03:40.700> because<00:03:41.700> I'm<00:03:41.819> going<00:03:41.970> to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
don't care about because I'm going to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.780 
don't care about because I'm going to
box<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:42.510> whole<00:03:42.750> frame<00:03:43.050> anyway<00:03:43.520> yes<00:03:44.520> it'll

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
box this whole frame anyway yes it'll

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
box this whole frame anyway yes it'll
never<00:03:45.060> handle<00:03:45.510> any<00:03:45.660> horsepower<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.440> just

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
never handle any horsepower it's just

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.540 
never handle any horsepower it's just
too<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.910> too<00:03:48.180> thin<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.800> channel<00:03:50.220> iron<00:03:50.370> I

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
too it's too thin this channel iron I

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.430 
too it's too thin this channel iron I
put<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.880> here<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.569> strong<00:03:52.050> that's<00:03:52.350> why

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
put in here is really strong that's why

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.280 
put in here is really strong that's why
the<00:03:52.590> wells<00:03:52.890> looked<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.340> little<00:03:53.430> funny<00:03:54.290> because

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the wells looked a little funny because

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.340 
the wells looked a little funny because
the<00:03:55.739> iron's<00:03:56.430> much<00:03:56.730> thicker<00:03:58.850> anyway<00:04:00.350> little

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
the iron's much thicker anyway little

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.290 
the iron's much thicker anyway little
more<00:04:01.620> welding<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.220> little<00:04:02.519> grinded<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.180> then

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
more welding a little grinded and then

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.680 
more welding a little grinded and then
I'll<00:04:03.510> plate<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.019> we'll<00:04:04.320> be<00:04:04.500> done<00:04:05.690> purely

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
I'll plate it and we'll be done purely

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.960 
I'll plate it and we'll be done purely
in<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.080> interest<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.739> aesthetics<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.519> decided

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
in the interest of aesthetics I decided

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.110 
in the interest of aesthetics I decided
not<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:10.310> plate<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.550> front<00:04:13.430> front<00:04:14.430> beam<00:04:14.730> here

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
not to plate this front front beam here

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.370 
not to plate this front front beam here
because<00:04:15.390> you're<00:04:15.540> going<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.810> able<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.019> see

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
because you're going to be able to see

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.440 
because you're going to be able to see
it<00:04:16.470> though<00:04:17.190> i<00:04:17.220> ground<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> out<00:04:17.850> pretty<00:04:18.090> smooth

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
it though i ground it out pretty smooth

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.730 
it though i ground it out pretty smooth
I'll<00:04:18.750> I'll<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.650> something<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.310> back<00:04:21.740> but

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'll I'll do something in the back but

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.830 
I'll I'll do something in the back but
you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.760> one<00:04:23.970> throw<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.450> off<00:04:24.600> pretty

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
you can see this one throw it off pretty

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.010 
you can see this one throw it off pretty
good<00:04:25.460> just<00:04:26.460> enough<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.240> junk<00:04:27.510> off<00:04:27.750> of

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
good just enough to get the junk off of

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.320 
good just enough to get the junk off of
it<00:04:28.760> kind<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.940> flat<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.810> put<00:04:30.990> plate<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.500> it

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
it kind of flat so I can put plate on it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.880 
it kind of flat so I can put plate on it
you<00:04:33.330> might<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.690> been<00:04:33.810> wondering<00:04:34.110> why<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.530> put

little of body putty in tweaking and not
look<00:05:24.230> like<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.710> was<00:05:24.860> one<00:05:25.130> piece<00:05:25.460> pretty<00:05:26.060> close

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360

and just back here I really don't care
about<00:05:31.270> because<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.510> body<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:32.870> going<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.170> cover
