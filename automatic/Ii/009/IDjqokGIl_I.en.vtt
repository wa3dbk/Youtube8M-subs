00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.810
 so still talking about account 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.730
 she has the individual global reading 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.600
 the object was large 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.790
 the object is large one of the letters of the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 The word big object is small with 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 few letters is a small word 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:49.340
 it can be that way by gathering letter 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.340
 the name itself in the case of one hotel 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.049
 mixed with other letters with the number 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:39.450
 represents she will try to use writing 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 and sound value 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 it also assumes that the smallest unit of the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:55.350
 line will assign to it related 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 she will relate 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.720
 will be that way in the case of braga 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
 can put a letter for each word 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.530
 given 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 in case of word she has done 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 she will put a word with three 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:37.670
 letters have reached with 201 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:31.520
 She already starts to lose it a little. 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.520
 decade 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.000
 she will understand 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.990
 she will make a global vision 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.440
 the more relaxed the global installed a 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.690
 reading easy to understand if joining the eye 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.170
 more electro 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:02.160
 she will understand this training goes 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:06.140
 can match according to the same 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:14.280
 She will try to match the sound. 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:17.970
 even more she performed on horseback half 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:06:32.310
 of the word can have your book 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:06:33.770
 thus she has no problem 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.160
 letter 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.570
 because of the difficulties is I have to 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:47.000
 my two year old daughter 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:56.100
 in the first year of the fundamental is 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:00.600
 complete if in the canonical motion advocate 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:08.510
 when the canonical word with 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.510
 difficulty is older in spelling 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.699
 to and this is our blog already be 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.930
 witness of the matter you will have your 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.300
 sake 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.250
 now a nature and contribute a little 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:54.569
 for a next lesson to the next 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:08:01.879
