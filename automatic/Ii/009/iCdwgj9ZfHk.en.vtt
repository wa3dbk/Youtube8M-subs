this<00:01:52.710> bike<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:54.439> 30,000<00:01:55.439> miles<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this bike right here 30,000 miles on the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.179 
this bike right here 30,000 miles on the
same<00:01:56.130> chain<00:01:56.869> using<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> little

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
same chain using this that is a little

00:01:59.189 --> 00:01:59.719 
same chain using this that is a little
messy

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
messy

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.580 
messy
put<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.630> let<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> soak<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.159> then

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
put it on there let it soak and then

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
put it on there let it soak and then
wipe<00:02:04.590> off<00:02:04.799> any<00:02:05.009> excess<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.820> doesn't<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.990> all

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
wipe off any excess so it doesn't go all

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.520 
wipe off any excess so it doesn't go all
over<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.380> bike<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:09.450> will<00:02:10.259> make<00:02:10.379> your

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
over your bike this will make your

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.530 
over your bike this will make your
chain<00:02:10.739> last<00:02:11.009> forever

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
chain last forever

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.070 
chain last forever
so<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:14.220> pretty<00:02:14.400> much<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.750> don't

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so that's pretty much that if you don't

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.369 
so that's pretty much that if you don't
like<00:02:16.290> using<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.810> motor<00:02:18.810> X<00:02:19.849> chain<00:02:20.849> wax<00:02:21.379> works

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
like using the motor X chain wax works

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.170 
like using the motor X chain wax works
pretty<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.510> stuff<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.930> here

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
pretty well it's this stuff right here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.850 
pretty well it's this stuff right here
it<00:02:27.180> dries<00:02:27.510> hard<00:02:27.900> though<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.799> don't

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
it dries hard though so I really don't

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.430 
it dries hard though so I really don't
like<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.019> put<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
like it you know you can put the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.289 
like it you know you can put the
synthetic<00:02:31.890> stuff<00:02:32.099> on<00:02:32.280> let<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.640> soak<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
synthetic stuff on let it soak in and

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.250 
synthetic stuff on let it soak in and
then<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.909> chain<00:02:36.120> wax<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:36.569> that's<00:02:36.989> kind<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
then put the chain wax so that's kind of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
then put the chain wax so that's kind of
what<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:40.019> works<00:02:40.200> pretty<00:02:40.349> well<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
what I do and it works pretty well so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
what I do and it works pretty well so
far<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.120> got<00:02:42.150> eight<00:02:42.420> thousand<00:02:42.810> miles<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.109> this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
far I got eight thousand miles on this

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.819 
far I got eight thousand miles on this
chain<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:45.060> only<00:02:45.269> been<00:02:45.810> adjusted<00:02:46.260> once<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.769> do

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
chain it's only been adjusted once I do

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.039 
chain it's only been adjusted once I do
ride<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.340> pretty<00:02:47.579> hard<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.530> other<00:02:49.739> than<00:02:49.859> that

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
ride it pretty hard but other than that

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.459 
ride it pretty hard but other than that
happy<00:02:52.049> ride<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.590> keep<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.250> two<00:02:53.430> wheels
