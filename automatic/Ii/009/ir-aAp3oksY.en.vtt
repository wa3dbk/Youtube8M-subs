and<00:00:23.769> now<00:00:23.920> AG<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.369> frames<00:00:24.820> as<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.420> can<00:00:25.570> see

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
and now AG the frames as you can see

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.829 
and now AG the frames as you can see
right<00:00:25.779> here<00:00:26.230> is<00:00:26.529> working<00:00:27.369> out<00:00:27.519> to<00:00:27.789> be<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.210> little

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
right here is working out to be a little

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.779 
right here is working out to be a little
bit<00:00:29.050> glitchy<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:29.890> it's<00:00:30.160> going<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.369> be<00:00:30.490> kind<00:00:30.640> of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
bit glitchy so it's going to be kind of

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.910 
bit glitchy so it's going to be kind of
difficult<00:00:30.939> especially<00:00:31.509> for<00:00:31.839> first<00:00:32.200> timers<00:00:32.500> to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
difficult especially for first timers to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.410 
difficult especially for first timers to
set<00:00:33.100> this<00:00:33.220> up<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:34.650> our<00:00:35.650> people<00:00:35.830> who<00:00:36.610> don't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
set this up for our people who don't

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.790 
set this up for our people who don't
want<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.660> mess<00:00:37.840> with<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.170> glitch<00:00:38.350> eNOS<00:00:38.649> of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
want to mess with the glitch eNOS of

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.959 
want to mess with the glitch eNOS of
setting<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.250> up<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.840> ahead<00:00:41.110> use<00:00:41.559> X<00:00:42.100> pearl<00:00:42.399> it

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
setting it up go ahead use X pearl it

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.119 
setting it up go ahead use X pearl it
works<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.420> exact<00:00:43.989> same<00:00:44.199> way<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.800> only<00:00:45.010> reason

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
works the exact same way the only reason

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.160 
works the exact same way the only reason
why<00:00:45.340> I'm<00:00:45.460> using<00:00:45.579> AG<00:00:46.090> unit<00:00:46.390> frames<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.870> because

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
why I'm using AG unit frames is because

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.310 
why I'm using AG unit frames is because
I<00:00:47.289> like<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.530> way<00:00:47.770> that<00:00:47.949> it<00:00:48.070> looks<00:00:49.109> by<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.140> way

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
I like the way that it looks by the way

thing that I used to use AG year in da g

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.039 
thing that I used to use AG year in da g
unit<00:02:53.350> frames<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:53.950> was<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.299> color<00:02:55.510> by<00:02:55.750> class

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
unit frames for was the color by class

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.729 
unit frames for was the color by class
which<00:02:56.470> explains<00:02:57.220> also<00:02:58.060> has<00:03:01.440> its<00:03:02.440> been

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
which explains also has its been

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.009 
which explains also has its been
glitching<00:03:03.010> out<00:03:03.310> lately<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:04.480> doing<00:03:04.870> this

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
glitching out lately I'm doing this

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.539 
glitching out lately I'm doing this
mostly<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.769> show<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:05.950> guys<00:03:06.070> how<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.459> was

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
mostly just to show you guys how it was

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.970 
mostly just to show you guys how it was
set<00:03:06.730> up<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.239> would<00:03:07.930> really<00:03:08.079> couldn't<00:03:08.590> use<00:03:08.950> a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
set up I would really couldn't use a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.330 
set up I would really couldn't use a
different<00:03:09.400> unit<00:03:09.609> frames

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
different unit frames

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.559 
different unit frames
so<00:03:10.849> this<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:11.420> what<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.410> looks<00:03:12.650> like

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
so this is just what it looks like

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.940 
so this is just what it looks like
some<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.079> glitches<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.409> are<00:03:15.560> beginning

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
some of the glitches that are beginning

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.800 
some of the glitches that are beginning
is<00:03:16.069> for<00:03:16.459> some<00:03:16.609> reason<00:03:16.879> I've<00:03:16.969> warrior<00:03:17.359> showing

two<00:04:28.570> buttons<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:29.170> you<00:04:29.290> can<00:04:29.440> see<00:04:29.620> i<00:04:29.650> was<00:04:29.890> just

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
two buttons as you can see i was just

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.770 
two buttons as you can see i was just
playing<00:04:30.190> with<00:04:30.460> them<00:04:30.610> there<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.480> will<00:04:31.570> switch

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
playing with them there that will switch

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.420 
playing with them there that will switch
to<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.020> Boston<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.470> switch<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.710> its<00:04:33.130> target
