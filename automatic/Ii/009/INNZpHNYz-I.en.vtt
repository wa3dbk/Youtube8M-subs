freeze<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.880> works<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.270> well<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:40.620> miscalculated

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
freeze it works as well I miscalculated

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.550 
freeze it works as well I miscalculated
I<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.300> know<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.420> couldn't<00:02:42.660> add<00:02:42.780> i<00:02:43.080> missed<00:02:43.470> the

these lysol were giving points back and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.940 
these lysol were giving points back and
that's<00:05:30.400> how<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.940> know<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.419> got<00:05:31.600> a<00:05:31.950> dollar

points if you spend ten dollars on those

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.600 
points if you spend ten dollars on those
so<00:05:37.300> therefore<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.900> subtracted<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.470> from<00:05:38.950> my

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
so therefore it subtracted that from my

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.659 
so therefore it subtracted that from my
well<00:05:40.060> originally<00:05:40.540> $35<00:05:41.530> for<00:05:41.710> everything<00:05:42.130> minus

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
well originally $35 for everything minus

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.020 
well originally $35 for everything minus
this<00:05:42.910> ten<00:05:43.180> dollars<00:05:43.479> was<00:05:43.660> $25<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:44.830> then<00:05:45.580> but

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
this ten dollars was $25 and then but

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.350 
this ten dollars was $25 and then but
these<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:47.250> almost<00:05:48.250> twelve<00:05:48.610> dollars<00:05:48.970> I<00:05:49.090> spent

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
these this almost twelve dollars I spent

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.360 
these this almost twelve dollars I spent
on<00:05:49.450> these<00:05:49.479> was<00:05:50.140> getting<00:05:50.620> subtracted<00:05:51.130> off<00:05:51.250> of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
on these was getting subtracted off of

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.630 
on these was getting subtracted off of
that<00:05:51.430> 25<00:05:52.030> so<00:05:52.600> therefore<00:05:53.140> i'm<00:05:53.950> not<00:05:54.190> getting<00:05:54.520> I

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
that 25 so therefore i'm not getting I

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.130 
that 25 so therefore i'm not getting I
don't<00:05:54.880> get<00:05:55.000> double<00:05:55.330> points<00:05:55.479> I<00:05:55.780> don't<00:05:55.990> get

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140
