00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here we have an exposure compensation

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.430

for<00:00:40.860> great<00:00:41.040> sensors<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> full-frame

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
for great sensors this is a full-frame

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
for great sensors this is a full-frame
sensor<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.550> no<00:00:44.789> joke<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
sensor so this is no joke right here and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
sensor so this is no joke right here and
it's<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> newest<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.950> lens<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's the newest one the lens is
definitely<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.450> quality<00:00:49.140> lens<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> better

definitely a quality lens and it better

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
definitely a quality lens and it better
be<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:50.640> stuck<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
be because you're stuck with it if you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
be because you're stuck with it if you
buy<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> camera<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.320> good<00:00:52.530> thing<00:00:52.739> about

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
buy the camera the good thing about

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
buy the camera the good thing about
having<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.340> dedicated<00:00:53.760> lens<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.960> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
having a dedicated lens is that this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
having a dedicated lens is that this
lens<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.949> designed<00:00:56.399> only<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.360> camera

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
lens was designed only for this camera

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
lens was designed only for this camera
so<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.590> forcing<00:00:59.510> high<00:01:00.510> ISO<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.770> I'm

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
so now I'm forcing high ISO and I'm

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.700 
so now I'm forcing high ISO and I'm
gonna<00:01:02.219> zoom<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> image<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.899> how

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
gonna zoom in on the image and see how

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
gonna zoom in on the image and see how
much<00:01:04.860> grain<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.900> I

the<00:01:20.520> autofocus<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> Sony<00:01:21.600> rx1<00:01:22.350> looks<00:01:22.710> like

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the autofocus on the Sony rx1 looks like

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980 
the autofocus on the Sony rx1 looks like
it's<00:01:23.070> pretty<00:01:23.220> solid<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.509> took<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:24.689> shots

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
it's pretty solid I just took some shots

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's pretty solid I just took some shots
of<00:01:25.259> cyclists<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.920> by<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.220> Central<00:01:26.610> Park<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
of cyclists going by in Central Park and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
of cyclists going by in Central Park and
it<00:01:27.780> seemed<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> knew<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.189> trying

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it seemed like it knew what I was trying

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
it seemed like it knew what I was trying
to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> photos<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.900> managed<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
to get the photos of and it managed to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
to get the photos of and it managed to
get<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.710> focus<00:01:32.130> even<00:01:32.369> well<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> guy's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
get them in focus even well this guy's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.740 
get them in focus even well this guy's
out<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.270> focus<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.750> about

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
out of focus but that's one out of about

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
out of focus but that's one out of about
six<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.530> I'll<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> say<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
six so I'll have to say that the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
six so I'll have to say that the
autofocus<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.420> intelligent<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:40.409> not

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
autofocus is pretty intelligent I'm not

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.130 
autofocus is pretty intelligent I'm not
sure<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:40.979> Sony's<00:01:41.579> decision<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.810> make<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sure about Sony's decision to make the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.499 
sure about Sony's decision to make the
camera<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> battery<00:01:44.250> charger<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.180> can't

camera be the battery charger you can't
charge<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> battery<00:01:46.380> unless<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
camera you can take the battery out of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.440 
the camera and then not charge it in
anything<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> guess<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.759> Sony<00:01:57.030> wants<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
anything so I guess what Sony wants you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
anything so I guess what Sony wants you
to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.840> buy<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.020> batteries<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
to do is buy two batteries this for a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.459 
to do is buy two batteries this for a
pro<00:01:59.790> level<00:02:00.090> camera<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> big<00:02:01.049> no-no

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
pro level camera I think is a big no-no

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
pro level camera I think is a big no-no
if<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> Canon<00:02:02.640> shooter<00:02:03.000> you'll

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
if you're a Canon shooter you'll

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.319 
if you're a Canon shooter you'll
appreciate<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.869> menus<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.820> menu<00:02:05.820> system<00:02:06.030> is

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is laid out very much like the canons
