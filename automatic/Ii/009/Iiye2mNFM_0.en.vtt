00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's kind of a big map i'm not a huge

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's kind of a big map i'm not a huge
fan<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.960> reason<00:01:13.170> i<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> map

so<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.700> two<00:01:14.970> bases<00:01:15.860> it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
so much is because it's two bases it's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.300 
so much is because it's two bases it's
just<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.520> small<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> i<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> so

just really small and i like it so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
just really small and i like it so
that's<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.439> my<00:01:22.439> halo<00:01:22.890> reach<00:01:23.630> quota

there's no real skill involved and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
there's no real skill involved and
actually<00:01:37.799> I'll<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.700> of

where I don't have a really an advantage

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.900 
where I don't have a really an advantage
of<00:02:47.350> hitting<00:02:47.769> somebody<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.790> know

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
of hitting somebody and you know

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.550 
of hitting somebody and you know
possibly<00:02:49.090> getting<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.630> kill<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.140> take<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
possibly getting the kill but I take the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920 
possibly getting the kill but I take the
shot<00:02:50.769> anyways<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.480> sometimes<00:02:52.480> they<00:02:52.600> even<00:02:52.630> get

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
shot anyways and sometimes they even get

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.280 
shot anyways and sometimes they even get
the<00:02:53.080> kill<00:02:53.760> surprisingly<00:02:54.760> enough<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:56.080> feel

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
the kill surprisingly enough and I feel

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.350 
the kill surprisingly enough and I feel
that<00:02:56.500> if<00:02:56.769> people<00:02:57.190> play<00:02:57.489> enough<00:02:57.730> SWAT<00:02:58.060> or

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
that if people play enough SWAT or

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.710 
that if people play enough SWAT or
people<00:02:58.690> play<00:02:59.280> yeah<00:03:00.280> SWAT<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.940> lot<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.599> know

just<00:03:43.329> put<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.540> BR<00:03:43.810> back<00:03:44.019> take<00:03:44.769> out<00:03:44.920> this

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
just put the BR back take out this

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.599 
just put the BR back take out this
crappy<00:03:45.760> DMR<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:46.900> put<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.139> VR<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.680> think

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
crappy DMR and just put the VR I think

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.690 
crappy DMR and just put the VR I think
everybody<00:03:48.970> will<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.269> enjoy<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:50.700> but

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
everybody will just enjoy that but

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.250 
everybody will just enjoy that but
otherwise<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.480> guns<00:03:52.690> are<00:03:52.840> pretty<00:03:53.019> cool<00:03:53.230> I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
otherwise the guns are pretty cool I

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.910 
otherwise the guns are pretty cool I
like<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.709> new<00:03:54.060> guns<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:56.350> elite<00:03:56.650> have

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
like the new guns that the elite have

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.160 
like the new guns that the elite have
those<00:03:57.220> are<00:03:57.340> kind<00:03:57.519> of<00:03:57.549> cool<00:03:58.079> something<00:03:59.079> about

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
those are kind of cool something about

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.590 
those are kind of cool something about
SWAT<00:03:59.680> here<00:04:00.100> that's<00:04:00.489> kind<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.819> confusing<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.510> I

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
SWAT here that's kind of confusing and I

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.840 
SWAT here that's kind of confusing and I
don't<00:04:01.930> really<00:04:02.109> like<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.709> spawns<00:04:03.069> as<00:04:03.400> you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
don't really like it's the spawns as you

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.879 
don't really like it's the spawns as you
can<00:04:03.970> see<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.450> just<00:04:04.540> absolutely<00:04:05.079> spawn<00:04:05.680> rate

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
can see I just absolutely spawn rate

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.180 
can see I just absolutely spawn rate
these<00:04:06.069> kids<00:04:06.340> because<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.900> Swat<00:04:08.500> or<00:04:08.799> maybe<00:04:09.010> it's

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
these kids because in Swat or maybe it's

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.940 
these kids because in Swat or maybe it's
just<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.700> map<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.239> general<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.170> Swat

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
just this map in general but in Swat

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.949 
just this map in general but in Swat
it's<00:04:12.310> one<00:04:12.760> hit<00:04:12.910> kills<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.389> it's<00:04:13.540> like<00:04:13.750> you

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it's one hit kills so it's like you

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.099 
it's one hit kills so it's like you
could<00:04:14.109> be<00:04:14.200> down<00:04:14.470> by<00:04:14.739> 10<00:04:15.069> or<00:04:15.370> 20<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.479> get<00:04:17.019> an

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
could be down by 10 or 20 and get an

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.539 
could be down by 10 or 20 and get an
overkill<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:17.829> your<00:04:17.919> whole<00:04:18.039> team<00:04:18.280> just

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
overkill and then your whole team just

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.830 
overkill and then your whole team just
pushes<00:04:18.880> through<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.120> other<00:04:19.299> side<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.690> map

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
pushes through the other side of the map

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.330 
pushes through the other side of the map
and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:20.139> it's<00:04:20.289> just<00:04:20.350> overkill<00:04:20.799> after<00:04:21.070> over

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
and then it's just overkill after over

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.969 
and then it's just overkill after over
killers<00:04:21.669> it's<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.930> can't<00:04:23.200> really<00:04:23.500> have<00:04:23.710> like

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
killers it's you can't really have like

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.580 
killers it's you can't really have like
a<00:04:24.159> good<00:04:24.430> team<00:04:24.669> or<00:04:24.849> a<00:04:24.880> bad<00:04:25.090> team

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
a good team or a bad team

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.770 
a good team or a bad team
it's<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.770> about<00:04:26.040> whoever<00:04:26.820> gets<00:04:26.910> top<00:04:27.330> control

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
it's all about whoever gets top control

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.990 
it's all about whoever gets top control
and<00:04:27.960> whoever<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.949> know<00:04:29.040> hits<00:04:29.310> them<00:04:29.520> hits<00:04:29.850> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and whoever you know hits them hits the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.510 
and whoever you know hits them hits the
hardest<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.540> guess<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:31.139> whoever<00:04:31.770> actually<00:04:31.949> you

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
hardest I guess and whoever actually you

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.640 
hardest I guess and whoever actually you
know<00:04:32.639> hits<00:04:33.090> their<00:04:33.330> head<00:04:33.360> shots<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.169> does

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
know hits their head shots and does

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.020 
know hits their head shots and does
teamwork<00:04:35.130> with<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.650> loadouts<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.490> don't

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
teamwork with it the loadouts I don't

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.969 
teamwork with it the loadouts I don't
really<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.270> them<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.810> I<00:04:40.139> like<00:04:40.500> sprint

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
although it's kind of like call of duty

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.770 
although it's kind of like call of duty
and<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.080> don't<00:04:43.229> like<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.460> but<00:04:44.460> if<00:04:45.449> anything

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
doubles really distracts everybody but I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.400 
doubles really distracts everybody but I
hate<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.910> when<00:04:57.090> it's<00:04:57.120> used<00:04:57.300> up<00:04:57.630> against<00:04:58.020> me<00:04:58.139> so

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
a little bit they're kind of cool but

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.719 
a little bit they're kind of cool but
otherwise<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.990> use<00:05:04.169> sprint<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.770> I'm<00:05:05.400> proud<00:05:05.669> to

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
otherwise I use sprint and I'm proud to

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.170 
otherwise I use sprint and I'm proud to
use<00:05:06.030> sprint<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:07.590> as<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.800> can<00:05:07.919> see<00:05:08.030> we're<00:05:09.030> down

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
by four and they only need three kills

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.190 
by four and they only need three kills
to<00:05:11.970> win<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.630> right<00:05:12.870> here<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:13.050> actually

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
to win it and right here I actually

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.960
