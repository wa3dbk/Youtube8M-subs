00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.169 
so the first thing I'd like to do
whenever<00:00:01.800> I'm<00:00:02.010> putting<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.370> Experian<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.060> I

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
whenever I'm putting the Experian is I

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990 
whenever I'm putting the Experian is I
like<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.480> get<00:00:03.600> everything<00:00:04.009> positioned<00:00:05.009> pretty

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
like to get everything positioned pretty

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.890 
like to get everything positioned pretty
much<00:00:06.120> laid<00:00:06.509> out<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.140> we<00:00:07.290> go<00:00:07.470> ahead<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:08.900> general

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
much laid out so we go ahead a general

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.830 
much laid out so we go ahead a general
location<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.950> on<00:00:11.219> them<00:00:11.370> now<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.330> went<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
location right on them now we went to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600 
location right on them now we went to
about<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> steering<00:00:13.679> wheel<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.219> because

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
about the steering wheel first because

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.320 
about the steering wheel first because
it's<00:00:14.759> pretty<00:00:14.910> easy

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it's pretty easy

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.130 
it's pretty easy
so<00:00:16.049> go<00:00:16.260> ahead<00:00:17.300> okay<00:00:20.119> take<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> bracket<00:00:21.840> that's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
so go ahead okay take a bracket that's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
so go ahead okay take a bracket that's
really<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.010> steering<00:00:23.490> wheel<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
really that's your steering wheel and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
really that's your steering wheel and
line<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.170> where<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> goes<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> frame

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
line it up to where it goes in the frame

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
line it up to where it goes in the frame
now<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.330> ahead<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.500> take<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.429> bolts<00:00:29.730> screw

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
now go ahead and I take your bolts screw

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.900 
now go ahead and I take your bolts screw
in<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.289> steering<00:00:31.590> wheel<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.430> here

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in this steering wheel what right here

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.319 
in this steering wheel what right here
is<00:00:33.120> held<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.960> through<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:35.070> bolts<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:36.180> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
is held on through two bolts right on

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.410 
is held on through two bolts right on
top<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> we're<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> hand<00:00:38.969> tighten

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
top so we're going to go a hand tighten

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
top so we're going to go a hand tighten
those<00:00:39.570> person<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.649> my

those person and I'm going to use my
registered<00:00:41.250> attending<00:00:41.700> down<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.090> bit

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.549 

now<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.110> connect<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
bolt that is attached to your ball joint

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
bolt that is attached to your ball joint
through<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.379> steering<00:00:58.739> knuckle<00:00:59.239> right<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
through your steering knuckle right like

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
through your steering knuckle right like
that<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.050> how<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.820> if

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that and how these I don't know if

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
that and how these I don't know if
you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> don't<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you can see it but now I don't think you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
you can see it but now I don't think you
guys<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> good<00:01:05.460> angle<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.790> there's<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> hole

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
guys got a good angle but there's a hole

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
guys got a good angle but there's a hole
through<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:07.020> bolts<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
through these bolts so what you do is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
through these bolts so what you do is
you<00:01:09.000> stick<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> bolt<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.350> screw

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you stick the bolt down and you screw

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
you stick the bolt down and you screw
this<00:01:10.860> none<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.689> cut<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this none and as you can see this cut is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.289 
this none and as you can see this cut is
kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> weird<00:01:13.830> looking<00:01:14.220> screw<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.909> excuse

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it through your known I can get it now

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
it through your known I can get it now
what<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.689> take<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.110> pin<00:01:34.350> get

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
what you need to do is take your pin get

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.469 
what you need to do is take your pin get
some<00:01:35.009> players<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> needle<00:01:35.970> nose<00:01:36.000> pliers

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
some players and needle nose pliers

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.749 
some players and needle nose pliers
would<00:01:36.689> probably<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> best<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.740> sift<00:01:38.549> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
would probably be the best and sift it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
would probably be the best and sift it
through<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
through see if I can get it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.389 
through see if I can get it
oh<00:01:41.840> halfway<00:01:42.840> there

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
oh halfway there

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.560 
oh halfway there
come<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.679> there<00:01:46.679> we<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.090> open<00:01:48.299> your

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
pen up on the other side and bam look at

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.679 
pen up on the other side and bam look at
that<00:01:52.109> now<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.189> exact<00:01:53.789> same<00:01:53.819> thing<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.600> the
