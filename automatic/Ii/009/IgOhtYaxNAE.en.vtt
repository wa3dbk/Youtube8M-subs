00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.990
 hello welcome to all of you on 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.340
 that when you had today a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 new introductory video that carries 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.529
 on the case the gx300 in dantec just 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.730
 a few xpec before moving on to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.439
 discovery of this case know that it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 is in tea format xx is rather 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.930
 intended for the gamer it measures 180 mm by 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 475 mm by 485 mm and weighs 5.45 kg at the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.940
 price level is between 49 and 59 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.280
 euros according to the shops 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 so here we are before this brand new 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 gx300 at the style level it's rather 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.270
 not bad is gamer with this little 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 tilt that gives rather a good 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.750
 personality to the case it changes a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.440
 little bit of what we find in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.210
 usually 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 after we have plastic fairings 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 on the top in the front and of course this 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.420
 big foot that we just talked about and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 little feet in the back we start 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.439
 with the front side here we have seven parties 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 which is translucent which lights up to 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 hombo once the machine turned on 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 we then find three bays 5.25 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.110
 inches a teak logo on a part in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 plastic and a new mesh grid 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.689
 who conceals who protects a fan 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.009
 from 120 mm to blue diodes we have the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.840
 possibility of putting a second 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.840
 fan at this place 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.619
 if we go now to the side we 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.720
 always find the mind a little leaning 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.520
 of this case with the foot that is more 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.799
 high up front we also find a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.430
 door that is equipped with a window in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.200
 plexiglass 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.960
 we see the door and bombay to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 the back now we find a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.159
 120 mm fan with blue diodes 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 who rides on cl en bloc 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.119
 the location of the plate hiroshi lde 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 of the motherboard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 slots 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.729
 extension then we have the location 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.189
 of the power disassembly of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.880
 side panels is done via screws to 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.459
 hand 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.950
 on the right side now we find 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.640
 so the same form of doors as of 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.140
 the other side 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.880
 except we do not have a plexiglass window 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.940
 but it will leave a large space 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.530
 internally to be able to install the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.940
 cables at the back of the tray of the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:32.019
 motherboard on the top now on 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:34.390
 will find a usb 3.0 a usb 2.0 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.459
 the audio inputs and outputs the reset on 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.349
 also the power 'with the others 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.950
 activities 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.330
 here we find a rheobus with a setting 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.830
 in haye a water setting 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.599
 here a location a small area of 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.970
 storage could tell us and then 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.560
 we have a grid in wick with the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.269
 possibility to put below two 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.269
 fans in 120 mm we pass 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:06.599
 now under the housing under the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:08.799
 case we have the feet by foam 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.140
 to fight against possible and 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.390
 parasitic vibrations and here we have the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.390
 filter for food 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.350
 right away we go inside of 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.750
 this gie x300 to do this we remove the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.980
 hand screw and we will draw the panels on 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.150
 see him 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.530
 this defect quite easily now 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.780
 that we are inside we 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.829
 discover here the three bays 5.25 inches 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.660
 with editing by then we saw the 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:49.030
 cages hdd ssd we have two 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 we have baskets inside 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.799
 plastic baskets that are that 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.260
 compatible 2.5 and 3.5 inches on 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:01.209
 found the silicone pads very 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.840
 dear to antec in front of these sites 2 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.470
 fans 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.989
 if desired one year 120 mm is present 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.359
 basic in the bottom we will find 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.489
 the location of the power supply and we 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.680
 see we have foam pads for 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.259
 to fight against possible vibrations 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.190
 parasites on the back now on 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.420
 found a 120-minute fan 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.820
 also be at the location of the 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.520
 plate or shield in the bottom the seven 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.080
 expansion slots with screw mounting to 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.670
 hand we also have a small grid 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.690
 Ventilation here 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.820
 finally we replaced 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.400
 feeding in the bottom we notice 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.860
 also we have cable management 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.360
 with passages in several places 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.430
 and passages that are also 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.000
 dedicated to micro-atx which is rather a 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.910
 good thing 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.920
 we have a wide access backplate a passage 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.620
 here in the top to be able to pass the 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.110
 cable the CPU to the card 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.540
 mother in the home now we see it 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.330

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.870
 to accommodate two fans of 120 mm 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.870
 maximum 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.450
