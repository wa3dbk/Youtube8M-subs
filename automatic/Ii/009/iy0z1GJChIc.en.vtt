snowboard

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.770 

level<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.270> mean<00:02:43.810> as<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.440> see

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

level one I mean as you can see
everything<00:02:46.780> runs<00:02:47.019> well<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:52.110> haven't<00:02:53.110> actually

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
everything runs well I haven't actually

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:02.310 
everything runs well I haven't actually
tried<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.670> using<00:02:57.660> doom<00:02:58.660> 2<00:02:59.170> yet<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:01.200> I'm<00:03:02.200> gonna

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
tried out using doom 2 yet so I'm gonna

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.490 
tried out using doom 2 yet so I'm gonna
go<00:03:02.500> ahead<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.739> try<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.010> too<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:05.260> that

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
go ahead and try that too I think that

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:50.360 
go ahead and try that too I think that
wasn't<00:03:05.799> startup

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.339 

so<00:03:51.370> overall<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.500> doomsday<00:03:53.980> engine<00:03:55.050> here<00:03:56.050> is

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
so overall the doomsday engine here is

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.880
