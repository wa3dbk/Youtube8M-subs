00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.540
 Hello friends! 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.710
 Today I have a quick video in which I will talk about 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 how do i use eyelash curlers and basic 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 rules for their use. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.460
 I often use eyelash curlers, because 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.070
 thanks to curled eyelashes, our eyes become more 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.590
 expressive, look more attractive, and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.329
 eyelashes look amazing! 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.161
 I often curl eyelashes precisely when I have 

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.430
 not enough time for a full makeup. 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.059
 And you want your eyes to be very expressive. 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.910
 Pay attention to the forceps. 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.040
 Forceps must be of good quality, their gum must 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.829
 be soft enough. 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.100
 Before using them on the cilia, look, 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.550
 whether your eyelashes are dyed with shadows or liner 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.409
 for eyes or ink. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.500
 Eyelashes when curling should be absolutely clean. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.530
 As you probably already understood, we apply mascara after curling 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 eyelashes. 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.229
 Regularly check the silicone gasket, not damaged 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.220
 whether she, whether cracked, whether it is elastic enough. 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.770
 And change it if necessary. 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.180
 As a rule, spare covers are always included. 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:50.690
 Hold for 5-10 seconds.
