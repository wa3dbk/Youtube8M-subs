00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
batteries we have all these old cliches

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.770 
batteries we have all these old cliches
are<00:00:35.850> simply<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.750> true<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:38.420> think<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> lot<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
are simply not true I think a lot of the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
are simply not true I think a lot of the
misconceptions<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.559> electric<00:00:41.040> cars<00:00:41.280> come

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
misconceptions about electric cars come

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
misconceptions about electric cars come
from<00:00:41.730> our<00:00:41.820> old<00:00:42.000> hang-ups<00:00:42.480> about<00:00:42.840> batteries

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
from our old hang-ups about batteries

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
from our old hang-ups about batteries
we've<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.890> had<00:00:44.250> phones<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.969> run<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.390> really

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we've all had phones that run out really

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.060 
we've all had phones that run out really
quickly<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.230> laptops<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> you've

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
quickly or laptops that you've

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
quickly or laptops that you've
constantly<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> plug<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.570> them

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
constantly have to plug in to use them

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
constantly have to plug in to use them
but<00:00:49.260> electric<00:00:49.710> cars<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> Nissan<00:00:50.610> Leaf

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
but electric cars and the Nissan Leaf

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.209 
but electric cars and the Nissan Leaf
are<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.620> even<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> quick

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
are really not like that so even a quick

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
are really not like that so even a quick
charge<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.820> fine<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> health<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
charge is fine for the health of the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
charge is fine for the health of the
battery<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.770> full<00:00:56.070> charge<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.610> last<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
battery and a full charge can last the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
battery and a full charge can last the
average<00:00:57.300> family<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> whole<00:00:58.020> week<00:01:00.559> one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the

electric car is of course the old

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
favourite Top Gear who drove and Miss

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
favourite Top Gear who drove and Miss
Hanley<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> said<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.939> brilliant<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
Hanley and said it was brilliant and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
Hanley and said it was brilliant and
really<00:01:09.750> enjoyed<00:01:09.990> driving<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.530> his<00:01:10.619> head<00:01:10.799> but

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
really enjoyed driving it his head but

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.710 
really enjoyed driving it his head but
the<00:01:11.040> only<00:01:11.159> problem<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.060> batteries<00:01:12.510> might

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the only problem is the batteries might

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.469 
the only problem is the batteries might
wear<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.110> three<00:01:13.920> years<00:01:13.950> later<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:15.090> car

they<00:01:15.780> drove<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.320> program<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.799> being

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
they drove in that program is being

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.490 
they drove in that program is being
driven<00:01:17.250> everyday<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> woman<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> London<00:01:19.170> and

driven everyday by a woman in London and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070 
driven everyday by a woman in London and
here's<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> shocking<00:01:20.790> truth<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.509> still<00:01:21.960> on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
here's the shocking truth it's still on
the<00:01:22.200> road<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> same<00:01:23.340> battery<00:01:23.759> it's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the road with the same battery it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.740 
the road with the same battery it's
perfectly<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.900> right

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.030 

so<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.020> your<00:01:35.079> can<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.380> hear<00:01:35.560> Becca<00:01:35.829> you

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
and tidy so what made you choose an

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.090 
and tidy so what made you choose an
electric<00:01:40.869> car<00:01:41.049> though<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.710> first<00:01:41.740> place

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
electric car though in the first place

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.859 
electric car though in the first place
well<00:01:42.430> as<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:43.000> see<00:01:43.210> how<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.420> live<00:01:43.750> in

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
well as you can see how you live in

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.020 
well as you can see how you live in
central<00:01:44.289> London<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.770> work<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.310> central<00:01:45.729> London

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
central London I work in central London

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.210 
central London I work in central London
you<00:01:46.299> don't<00:01:46.479> pay<00:01:46.600> congestion<00:01:47.289> you'll<00:01:47.830> get<00:01:47.979> free

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
you don't pay congestion you'll get free

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.340 
you don't pay congestion you'll get free
parking<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.479> you're<00:01:49.630> really<00:01:49.840> using<00:01:50.049> as<00:01:50.320> a

Nissan Leafs have had to have their
batteries<00:02:50.829> replaced<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.850> very<00:02:52.180> very

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780

Emily and one of the biggest comments
they<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.490> is<00:03:13.610> about<00:03:13.700> how<00:03:13.910> quiet<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.360> car<00:03:14.600> is

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
they have is about how quiet the car is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
and how smooth the ride is we found the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.520 
and how smooth the ride is we found the
car<00:03:17.150> great<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.750> terms<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.110> their<00:03:18.260> maintenance

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
car great in terms of their maintenance

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.200 
car great in terms of their maintenance
and<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.950> batches<00:03:19.280> would<00:03:19.400> be<00:03:19.490> very<00:03:19.700> reliable

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
and the batches would be very reliable

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.090 
and the batches would be very reliable
in<00:03:20.480> terms<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.870> ability<00:03:21.020> to<00:03:21.260> recharge<00:03:21.860> and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
in terms of the ability to recharge and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.640 
in terms of the ability to recharge and
maintaining<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.030> charge<00:03:23.360> they<00:03:24.320> charge

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
maintaining that charge they charge

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.020 
maintaining that charge they charge
overnight<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.310> then<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:25.460> have<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:25.790> charge

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
overnight and then we have one charge

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.520 
overnight and then we have one charge
during<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.390> day<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.600> top<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.050> up<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.410> that's
