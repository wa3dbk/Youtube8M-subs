00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 nuclear power were overflown by 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.950
 drones in october our 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 central are they vulnerable are 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 they are in danger at the mercy of an attack 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.960
 this is the angry question of 7:15 on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 europe 1 and to answer it I receive 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.290
 yannick rousselet hello hello you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 are in charge of nuclear campaign for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 greenpeace france already is that it's 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
 what is it you greenpeace 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.500
 Hippolyte who piloted these drones 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 not clearly one expresses oneself and has very 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 quickly we even contacted 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 directly the services of the state the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 senior defense official for good 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.269
 tell him that it's not us because 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 that I was in the past that late lag 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 2011 a little video you on stage 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 the real difference is when you do 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.570
 something that we can always 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.730
 claimed always acted to face 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 discovered and of course if it was 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.010
 we will tell you today 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.899
 really a national security issue 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
 way to cast doubt on the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.379
 anxious to show you that it is that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 it's more vulnerable to say no 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 it's no, we talk about it very clearly 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.329
 when we do something we say 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.770
 we say things we would never have 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 been saying publicly this is not where 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 if it were not the case it can be 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.559
 who then is havre is a real 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 question a real problem 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 df now admits today seven power plants 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.350
 nuclear or six nuclear power plants 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 game but in fact we already know 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 by direct testimonials from others 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.150
 sources that there have been other sites there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.159
 not only f's in question 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 there is a dream to pierrelatte there is the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.150
 CEA Saclay therefore a set of sites that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.610
 did not start either on the 5th 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.049
 october as said edf but it has 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 started on September 14th 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.049
 and then the last flyby it's up to you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 but you know a lot more than 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
 it was simply because we have 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 obviously a network of people right and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.920
 on the left who can talk to us about 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.890
 things the last flyby it was at 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.119
 priori identified last monday so 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 it's a little story actually 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 continues which is not complete and which 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 obviously is disturbing 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.799
 yannick rousselet is precisely this is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 that they are really worrying is this 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.560
 that means that our plants are 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 vulnerable at the mercy of attacks 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.700
 terrorists tomorrow there are we will say 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 a cylinder one around the power plants that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 theoretically is forbidden to fly over 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.979
 so obviously we should think that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.049
 this is a space that is impenetrable 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 so obviously we've already demonstrated 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.740
 that it was possible to go back there is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 simply there we are in a series and 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 then recurs in theory 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.290
 more in a period of alert by 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 relation to terrorism we are in a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.479
 climate 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.880
 still very tense today and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 despite it being repeated and on sites 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 so who have been identified on 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.920
 realizes that eventually nobody 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.220
 can not cope with what is happening 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.500
 product 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.849
 we even have a day on October 19th and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.140
 four sites at the same time ie 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.880
 that it is an operation anyway 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.350
 large, large magnitudes 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.670
 very coordinated which suggests that he 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 is grams of an organization 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.620
 equipped with the means 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.209
 you are extremely well informed about 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.650
 same time it's not a drone that can 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 blow up a cc reactor this is a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.819
 mosquito on a nandrolone windshield 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.560
 reading obviously between tomb such a 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.050
 on the reactor enclosure itself 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 obviously it wants to do little harm 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.290
 we just have one side of the pools 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.670
 used fuel storage 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.810
 some of which contain three volumes 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.520
 of nuclear reactors 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.840
 we saw in fukushima that these pools 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.459
 storage poses true 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.020
 problems and this one by cons they 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.160
 are absolutely not bunkerized 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.120
 today you have managed to 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
 go back some time ago in a 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.410
 pool to approach a pool on the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.700
 pool although from there we know 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.890
 that these pools are accessible but 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.140
 obviously a drone that would be loaded 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.269
 in tnt that would hit a 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.670
 pool laterally we have a stake of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.200
 security extremely it tells you 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.820
 that today this risk exists 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.260
 clearly down the demonstration is 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.700
 I do not know who I was 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.750
 a problem but today the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.760
 demonstration is made that we can 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 turn around a power station 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 start again the next day at different 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.130
 places in France and nothing 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.660
 today has been able neither of them 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.620
 identify says that stops is what 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.510
 you would be saying that there is a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.950
 risk of air attack an airplane that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.079
 could approach or spit on a 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.120
 central is the rule it's 5 km around 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.799
 and 1000 meters above the sites in te 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.239
 do all this was going to respect this 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.760
 rule they did not spend so our 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.769
 very regularly 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480
 air forces intervene because 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.760
 eventually people get lost or 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.799
 people are not paying attention and getting in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.280
 in these intermediate spaces 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.360
 intervenes whenever they 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.290
 intervene only very 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.430
 usually they stop people 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.350
 when they arrive at an airport 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.260
 after that is to say that the times of 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.970
 reaction are anyway beyond the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 time that would have allowed these to these 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.840
 aircraft to crash facilities 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.970
 today none of our plants 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.470
 nuclear power can withstand the fall of a 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.410
 plane they were not designed for that 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.390
 like this it's about design a 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.739
 which was before the attacks of 11 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.390
 September which we were in a study 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.799
 probabilistic we are very unlikely 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.660
 that it happens so we did not do it 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.680
 today our plants would not resist 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.910
 not a fall of lyon what he 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 should be done to secure them then 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.160
 its power plants 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.750
 obviously it very simple solution it is 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.310
 to stop them you just know 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.540
 behind even if we stop them she 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.220
 remains vulnerable and dangerous because 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.419
 dozens of ways while waiting for the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.780
 key to all our plants under the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.459
 door 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.019
 tonight so obviously there is a 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 real problem today of safety and 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.040
 security that must be taken into account 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.420
 by the state is the restoration in 2012 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.340
 ford at the time putting from the inside 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.230
 wanted a check and reinforcement of 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.550
 150 km of fences in the park 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.950
 so we put all endabout but it has 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.030
 been doing that or not almost nothing I 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.230
 would say that at each penetration of 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 greenpeace have but maybe a meter 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.890
 moreover we put two more guards 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.360
 as easily validated is to 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.640
 shenanigans in a nuclear power plant 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.440
 as we want we can penetrate frame on 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.760
 can drop something with a drome 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.350
 our plants today are 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.540
 absolutely vulnerable who sent his 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.760
 drones that's it's still a real mystery is 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.440
 extremely bizarre I confess 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.180
 that today we have no scenario 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.040
 we really thought not you for 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.870
 usefully demonstrate the vulnerability of 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.850
 his share we thought we served this state 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.190
 who would do tests on safety 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.110
 just badly see edf was going to wear 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.980
 complaint right after the I think when 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.150
 same as half an hour ago a 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.750
 better coordination at the level 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.190
 national 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.540
 thank you annie crouzet for coming in 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.650
 live on europe 1 this morning you're 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.540
 I remind him the campaigner 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.230
 nuclear for greenpeace france thank you 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.230
 and good day to you
