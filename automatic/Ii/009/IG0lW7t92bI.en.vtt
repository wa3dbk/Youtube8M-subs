00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.580 
pro l50 a now getting to the memory is
quite<00:00:20.760> easy<00:00:21.119> we've<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> paddle

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
quite easy we've just got the paddle

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460 
quite easy we've just got the paddle
here<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.160> there's<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.609> screw<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:25.320> need

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
here and there's one screw so just need

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
here and there's one screw so just need
to<00:00:25.560> undo<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.310> screw<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.480> I've

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
to undo that one screw and I think I've

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
to undo that one screw and I think I've
already<00:00:27.750> undone<00:00:28.199> yes<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.039> screw<00:00:29.340> actually

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
already undone yes the screw actually

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.790 
already undone yes the screw actually
doesn't<00:00:29.880> come<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.269> fully<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.529> remove

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
doesn't come out fully but just remove

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
doesn't come out fully but just remove
the<00:00:31.949> panel<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.030> couple<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.390> little

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the panel there's a couple of little

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600 
the panel there's a couple of little
tabs<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.500> back<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> panel<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
tabs on the back of the panel there and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310 
tabs on the back of the panel there and
there<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.149> watch<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.870> break

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
there so just watch your don't break

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770 
there so just watch your don't break
them<00:00:37.500> off<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.790> we've<00:00:38.940> got<00:00:39.090> access<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
them off and now we've got access to the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.139 
them off and now we've got access to the
memory<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:41.129> either<00:00:41.460> side<00:00:41.850> there's<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
memory and then either side there's a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
memory and then either side there's a
little<00:00:42.360> metal<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.290> flick<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
little metal bit just flick that to the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
little metal bit just flick that to the
side<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.579> pop<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.140> one

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
side and they pop up and on this one

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
side and they pop up and on this one
they've<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> little<00:00:46.860> plastic<00:00:47.149> bit<00:00:48.149> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
they've got a little plastic bit in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.959 
they've got a little plastic bit in
between<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.140> gems<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.370> again<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
between the two gems but again you just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
between the two gems but again you just
pull<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.860> pops<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.430> can

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
pull them down and that pops up you can

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.139 
pull them down and that pops up you can
pull<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> upgrade<00:00:56.489> arm<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
pull that out so the upgrade arm or to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
pull that out so the upgrade arm or to
put<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.989> push<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
put them back in just push them in then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.119 
put them back in just push them in then
down<00:00:59.300> just<00:01:00.300> push<00:01:00.780> them<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.739> reverse

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
down just push them in so just reverse

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.280 
down just push them in so just reverse
of<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.760> did<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.149> them<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.420> so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
of what you did to get them out so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
of what you did to get them out so
that's<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> memory<00:01:05.220> itself<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.659> into

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that's the memory itself now to get into

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's the memory itself now to get into
the<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.200> bits<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.909> 14

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the other bits here there's actually 14

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
the other bits here there's actually 14
screws<00:01:10.020> I'll<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.619> show<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.310> all

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
screws I'll just show you where they all

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
screws I'll just show you where they all
are<00:01:11.490> I've<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.180> removed<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.840> already

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
are I've actually removed them already

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
are I've actually removed them already
just<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.340> speed<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> video

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
just to make the or speed up the video

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.649 
just to make the or speed up the video
there's<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.140> two<00:01:16.530> three<00:01:16.560> four<00:01:17.270> five<00:01:18.270> six

I<00:01:25.740> prefer<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> model<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:28.130> actually

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I prefer to do on this model is actually

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
I prefer to do on this model is actually
remove<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> optical<00:01:30.240> drive<00:01:30.390> first<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
remove the optical drive first and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
remove the optical drive first and
that's<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.680> screw<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.880> once<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that's that screw there but once that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
that's that screw there but once that
screws<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.560> pull

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
screws out what you can do is just pull

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.819 
screws out what you can do is just pull
the<00:01:35.280> optical<00:01:35.610> drive<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.650> then<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the optical drive out and then you can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
the optical drive out and then you can
actually<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> cover<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
actually get into here the cover and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.260 
actually get into here the cover and
just<00:01:40.560> pull<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.850> hear<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
just pull up and you can hear it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.399 
just pull up and you can hear it
unclipping<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.780> we've<00:01:46.200> got<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
unclipping so there we are we've got the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.399 
unclipping so there we are we've got the
internals<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> unit<00:01:48.360> we've<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.320> the
