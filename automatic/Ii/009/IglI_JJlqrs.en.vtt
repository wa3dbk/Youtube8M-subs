00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello everyone , I was asked to gash 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.469
 vidosik where including how dynamic 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.190
 scenes but as I said along the way it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.780
 will turn out 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.130
 sucks because here's the phone being filmed 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.630
 something like this is all ribbit 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.689
 Actually not very well, I promised to know 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.560
 anything yes I'll write it down trailer krayzis 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.560
 3 full hd all things let's look 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 in general, how many use it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.530
 I have no complaints about the monitor 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.420
 that is, everything is fine about 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 dynamic and that's not even thought 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.800
 not only when buying looked something 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.769
 what's the response time 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:10.380
 valid and everything is fine so here for now 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:13.280
 the scenes are calm but not exactly later 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 batch will start 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 Here I see the picture is very colorful there 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:27.710
 look at the monitor itself and look at 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.060
 the phone is not very well, in short everything that's 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.110
 flickers on 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.110
 on the screen there is no such thing normal 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:51.260
 that is, there is no smearing anything 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.260
 I don't see any mistake 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.390
 well, by the way since I'm showing the trailer 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 crysis 3 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.820
 play the game zdorovskaya 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:23.209
 here now pause gives so here 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:25.040
 here's krayzis 3's on the phone and 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.879
 right now I see just empty smeared 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.340
 the picture is bright red on the screen 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.260
 inscription 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.739
 deep blue background right here 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.760
 here that is, everything is clearly displayed but 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:45.799
 This I about flowers as passes therefore 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.790
 damn all this garbage could this video 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:55.720
 In principle, do not write well 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:01.940
 asked and even about the highlights 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:05.450
 asked to make a video so from the opening 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.870
 He found such an ad he certainly didnâ€™t 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.409
 full hd but dynamic that's where it comes from 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.799
 from here it's from the movie kinda like 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.799
 ultraviolet 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.110
 but by the way, though not full hd Stein on 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.750
 some kind of 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.879
 I do not observe hard pixels of squares 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.769
 ok but although his father has them 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.250
 was now 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.250
 smeared some 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.240
 Well, I even wanted to filter 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.020
 is a colorful action movie 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.180
 so well about the lights there is such 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.090
 special program ulkan she 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.220
 actually to be broken 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.730
 pixel and check but for our purposes 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.020
 will fit 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:30.370
 so here is a pure white background shorter than broken 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.500
 There are no pixels I already checked 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.980
 bright red here it is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:42.010
 orange garbage in the center but it is 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.010
 the phone takes off shorter so 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.259
 here now here is a bright green but 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:05:00.530
 on the phone of some kind 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:05:02.720
 horseradish blue blue that's more 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.130
 Looks like some kind of dirty yellow stuff 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.840
 new on the screen bright yellow and by the way 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:15.169
 he is visible stripes pwm 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:20.750
 Now a black screen so I just tell my 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:24.949
 There is a slight sensation of light 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.590
 somewhere here so here that is this 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:32.620
 ie it does not stand out either as that is, 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.620
 here and there you can see a little bit right 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:39.949
 it is only here on a black background and it is here 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.720
 almost invisible that is only if 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.569
 peer so about the glare not 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.719
 worry about dynamism 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:58.180
 worry, too, is not worth the monitor 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:06:01.580
 I advise you to take a cool do not hesitate 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.250
 there is of course like design if not 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:09.680
 like the design of the same best on 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.630
 same matrix just a lot of monitors 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:19.009
 the functionality is the same but not the other 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:21.520
 design or there are entrances to others in general up 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.520
