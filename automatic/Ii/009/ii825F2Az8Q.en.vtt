half<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> size<00:01:14.040> I'm<00:01:14.880> sure<00:01:15.030> you'll<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.270> fine

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.580 

you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.120 

so<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:18.800> we<00:02:18.920> are<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.810> big<00:02:20.810> shoot<00:02:21.110> small<00:02:21.860> little

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
so here we are in big shoot small little

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.160 
so here we are in big shoot small little
town<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.790> mostly<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.150> part<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.750> trench

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
town it's mostly just part of the trench

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.460 
town it's mostly just part of the trench
7<00:02:24.500> water<00:02:24.710> weight<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.970> watching<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.470> lock

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
7 water weight just watching the lock

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.140 
7 water weight just watching the lock
system<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.160> quite<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> lock<00:02:28.640> here<00:02:28.670> though

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
system it's not quite a lock here though

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.180 
system it's not quite a lock here though
it's<00:02:29.300> more<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.440> can't<00:02:30.680> go<00:02:30.800> through<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's more like you can't go through the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.230 
it's more like you can't go through the
land<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.580> go<00:02:31.700> over<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.410> they<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:34.240> huge

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
land you go over it so they have a huge

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.900 
land you go over it so they have a huge
array<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.200> lifts<00:02:36.830> boats<00:02:37.280> out<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.820> water

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
array that lifts boats out of the water

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.100 
array that lifts boats out of the water
and<00:02:38.450> harry's<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.290> over

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and harry's of over

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.399 
and harry's of over
drops<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.260> back<00:02:42.440> at<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.739> lakeland<00:02:42.950> get<00:02:43.250> aside

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
drops it back at the lakeland get aside

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.949 
drops it back at the lakeland get aside
it's<00:02:45.409> just<00:02:45.620> another<00:02:45.879> another<00:02:46.879> way<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.120> doing

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
it's just another another way of doing

00:02:47.959 --> 00:04:20.430 
it's just another another way of doing
some<00:02:48.110> amazing<00:02:48.170> feats<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.830> engineering

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.300 

probably<00:04:21.440> be<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.829> couple<00:04:21.919> more<00:04:22.100> mats

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
probably be here for a couple more mats

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.500 
probably be here for a couple more mats
just<00:04:22.639> taking<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.880> little<00:04:22.910> bit<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.240> stretch

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and watching the lift system taking the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.230 
and watching the lift system taking the
boats<00:04:26.810> over<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.200> roadway<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:29.060> we'll<00:04:29.180> be

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
boats over the roadway and then we'll be

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.810 
boats over the roadway and then we'll be
moving<00:04:29.389> on<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:30.139> Bala<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.220> stop<00:04:31.550> them<00:04:31.700> there
