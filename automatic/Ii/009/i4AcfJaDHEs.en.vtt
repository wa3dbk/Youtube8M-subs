00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
transferred to the water in that water

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
transferred to the water in that water
or<00:00:40.320> water<00:00:40.530> glycol<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.430> come<00:00:41.579> directly<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the chiller of operator which is this

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
piece right here

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
piece right here
what<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> chiller<00:00:46.410> evaporator<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.460> where

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
what the chiller evaporator is is where

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
what the chiller evaporator is is where
the<00:00:48.390> process<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.230> side<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the process water side in the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
the process water side in the
refrigerant<00:00:50.760> side<00:00:50.820> meet<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.410> heat<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
refrigerant side meet and the heat is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.069 
refrigerant side meet and the heat is
transferred<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> works<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.930> through

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
transferred how that works is through

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.610 
transferred how that works is through
the<00:00:55.199> second<00:00:55.590> law<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.360> thermodynamics<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
the second law of thermodynamics the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.900 
the second law of thermodynamics the
second<00:00:58.620> law<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> thermodynamics<00:00:59.489> states<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
second law of thermodynamics states a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
second law of thermodynamics states a
hotter<00:01:00.210> source<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.809> always<00:01:01.170> move<00:01:01.410> towards<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
hotter source will always move towards a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
hotter source will always move towards a
colder<00:01:02.879> source<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> refrigerant<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
colder source so the refrigerant has to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
colder source so the refrigerant has to
be<00:01:05.159> colder<00:01:05.549> than<00:01:06.270> your<00:01:06.600> desired<00:01:07.049> leading

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
be colder than your desired leading

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
be colder than your desired leading
water<00:01:07.619> temperature<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.540> warm

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
water temperature so you got your warm

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
water temperature so you got your warm
fluid<00:01:10.229> coming<00:01:10.560> into<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.040> chiller<00:01:11.250> evaporator

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
fluid coming into the chiller evaporator

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.390 
fluid coming into the chiller evaporator
the<00:01:12.570> heat<00:01:12.780> transferred<00:01:13.320> over<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the heat transferred over to the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390 
the heat transferred over to the
refrigerant<00:01:15.299> side<00:01:15.770> then<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.220> your

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
refrigerant side then you will have your

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
refrigerant side then you will have your
desired<00:01:17.820> leading<00:01:18.390> water<00:01:18.600> temperature<00:01:19.140> back

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
desired leading water temperature back

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
desired leading water temperature back
to<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.340> process<00:01:21.229> go<00:01:22.229> take<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to your process go take a look at that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
to your process go take a look at that
video<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> you'll<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.570> better

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
video and you'll get a little bit better

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.640 
video and you'll get a little bit better
in-depth<00:01:25.350> explanation<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> let's<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.470> back

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
in-depth explanation so let's get back

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.880 
in-depth explanation so let's get back
to<00:01:29.100> our<00:01:29.490> refrigerant<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.710> heat

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
to our refrigerant side here the heat

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
to our refrigerant side here the heat
has<00:01:31.979> been<00:01:32.040> transferred<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> water<00:01:33.390> side

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
has been transferred from the water side

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.109 
has been transferred from the water side
to<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> refrigerant<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> point

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to the refrigerant and at this point

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.760 
to the refrigerant and at this point
it's<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> low-pressure<00:01:38.460> gas

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's going to be a low-pressure gas

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's going to be a low-pressure gas
going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> travel<00:01:41.100> its<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
going to travel its way to the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
going to travel its way to the
compressor<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.159> what<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.280> happen<00:01:44.549> there

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
compressor and what will happen there

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
compressor and what will happen there
inside<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> compressor<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:46.619> take

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
inside the compressor is it will take

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
inside the compressor is it will take
that<00:01:47.040> low-pressure<00:01:47.369> gas<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.780> compress<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that low-pressure gas and compress it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160 
that low-pressure gas and compress it
into<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:50.090> high-pressure<00:01:51.090> gas<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.930> all

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
into a high-pressure gas that's all

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.950 
into a high-pressure gas that's all
really<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> compressor<00:01:52.890> does<00:01:53.720> after<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.840> been

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
really a compressor does after it's been

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
really a compressor does after it's been
compressed<00:01:55.579> it<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.729> leave<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.939> compressor

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
compressed it will leave that compressor

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.819 
compressed it will leave that compressor
and<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.950> air-cooled<00:01:59.579> condensers<00:02:00.479> here

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
and go to the air-cooled condensers here

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.289 
and go to the air-cooled condensers here
now<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.520> makes<00:02:02.729> an<00:02:02.850> air<00:02:03.030> cooled

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
now this is what makes an air cooled

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.749 
now this is what makes an air cooled
chiller<00:02:03.479> different<00:02:03.960> from<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.200> water-cooled

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
chiller different from a water-cooled
