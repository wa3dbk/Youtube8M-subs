we'll now notice that the theft lamp is

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.599 
we'll now notice that the theft lamp is
flashing<00:04:00.079> that's<00:04:00.560> because<00:04:00.890> we<00:04:01.010> have<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> brand

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
flashing that's because we have a brand

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.640 
flashing that's because we have a brand
new<00:04:01.670> pass<00:04:02.450> light<00:04:02.690> sensor<00:04:03.079> installed<00:04:03.349> with<00:04:03.560> our
