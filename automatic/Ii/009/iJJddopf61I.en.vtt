00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello I am today with 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.680
 guillaume a specialist of the tie 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.389
 and butterfly glasses he goes elsewhere 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 show us right away how to do 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.880
 a paper on a bow tie you 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.010
 can adjust the length 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 once the is not so the simplest 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.990
 to start and meters the length 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.930
 one at most make your nodes of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 wind to then adjust the length and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 adjust it well to your neck the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.539
 length that you can adjust next 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 some brands of bow ties 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.530
 that may change but after you have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.079
 small small systems for 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 adjust the length of the bow tie 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 this is the bow tie starts so 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 close enough to ours flap 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.309
 it is on the end that we will have great 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.860
 changes so you start with 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.219
 cross like on a tie bone 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 you leave by folding the back of the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.020
 bow tie that will do the first 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.229
 part of the bow tie 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 then we go back over 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.290
 the interior really very close to a 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 tie 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.130
 there you already have a first part of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 bow tie 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.220
 you can see here then the part 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 delicate and that's where we leave the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.509
 tie method 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 it's going to be back to this part if at 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.350
 inside the loop to get the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.549
 complete pavilion so we will do it 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.509
 in this way by first passing a corner 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.729
 which by gradually dragging 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 the bowties are in themselves as 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.930
 the ties and so if you go there 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.829
 too violently you risk to offend 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.110
 silk and spoil your taste buds 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.250
 So, once we have passed the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.310
 part of the bow tie 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 we just can take a little 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.930
 not much time 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.190
 we just have the butterfly here it is necessary 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.600
 know that if you put your fingers 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.240
 behind with you pushing forward 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.650
 the central part of a butterfly is going to 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.270
 tighten 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.860
 after according to the tastes of each 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.720
 you can wear one more tavillons 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.140
 or less wide more or less big you 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.830
 want your bow tie 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.830
 here you take the opportunity to adjust it yourself 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.850
 replace the bowtie must 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.850
 adjust to your size
