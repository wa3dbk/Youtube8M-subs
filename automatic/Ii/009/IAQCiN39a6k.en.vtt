so I decided to pull this forward set

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.189 
so I decided to pull this forward set
that<00:04:58.320> over<00:04:58.560> there

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
that over there

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.580 
that over there
now<00:05:00.389> becomes<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.539> pulps<00:05:01.810> going<00:05:02.020> back<00:05:02.259> in<00:05:02.499> the

now becomes the pulps going back in the

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.170 
now becomes the pulps going back in the
mix<00:05:02.830> there's<00:05:03.159> no<00:05:03.310> need<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.550> wait<00:05:03.789> for<00:05:03.819> every

how's<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.070> pulse<00:05:06.280> gonna<00:05:06.550> go<00:05:06.699> back<00:05:06.910> in

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
how's the pulse gonna go back in

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.550 
how's the pulse gonna go back in
so

our chiropractor friend of mine told me
that<00:06:43.860> juice<00:06:44.249> 10%<00:06:44.999> is<00:06:45.120> too<00:06:45.360> sweet

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.709 
and it's best to have he says 50/50
water<00:06:50.039> I<00:06:50.159> think<00:06:50.460> that's<00:06:50.669> -<00:06:50.939> they<00:06:51.060> did<00:06:51.300> it<00:06:51.330> so<00:06:51.599> I

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:51.719 
water I think that's - they did it so I

00:06:51.719 --> 00:07:05.080 
water I think that's - they did it so I
only<00:06:51.930> put<00:06:52.639> 20%<00:06:53.639> water<00:06:53.789> in<00:06:54.029> for<00:06:54.240> my<00:06:54.360> taste

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.720 

and<00:07:05.810> I'll<00:07:05.900> top<00:07:06.200> that<00:07:06.440> off<00:07:06.590> later

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
and I'll top that off later

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:17.720

and<00:07:09.000> then<00:07:14.510> it'll<00:07:15.510> start<00:07:15.810> with<00:07:16.110> the<00:07:17.100> banks<00:07:17.460> next

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
and then it'll start with the banks next

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.900
