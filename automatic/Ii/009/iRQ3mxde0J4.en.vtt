00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
lifting up on this opening that power

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
lifting up on this opening that power
strap<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.079> allows<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.650> back<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> boot<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
strap it allows the back of the boot to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
strap it allows the back of the boot to
actually<00:01:41.640> open<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.000> almost<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> 90<00:01:42.840> degrees

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
actually open with almost the 90 degrees

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.999 
actually open with almost the 90 degrees
and<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.520> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.210> underscore<00:01:45.600> how

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
and I think I want to underscore how

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
and I think I want to underscore how
cool<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.430> work<00:01:47.579> together

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
cool those two work together

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
cool those two work together
most<00:01:49.049> boots<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> ski/walk<00:01:50.369> feature

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
most boots that have a ski/walk feature

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.660 
most boots that have a ski/walk feature
have<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> traditional<00:01:51.840> power<00:01:52.619> strap<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.579> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
have a traditional power strap and so if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
have a traditional power strap and so if
you<00:01:53.759> pop<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> ski<00:01:54.509> walk<00:01:54.689> open<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.500> don't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you pop the ski walk open but don't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
you pop the ski walk open but don't
loosen<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> power<00:01:56.250> strap<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.729> won't<00:01:56.880> move<00:01:57.060> no

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
loosen the power strap it won't move no

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
loosen the power strap it won't move no
and<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.990> loosen<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> power<00:01:58.590> strap<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and if you loosen the power strap you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
and if you loosen the power strap you
have<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> power<00:01:59.399> strap<00:01:59.640> hanging<00:02:00.149> into<00:02:00.689> the

have a power strap hanging into the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.310 
have a power strap hanging into the
ground<00:02:01.590> oh<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.130> the

power strip so it doesn't fall here you

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.520 
power strip so it doesn't fall here you
just<00:02:07.270> pop<00:02:07.479> one<00:02:07.720> pop<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.140> other<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.440> don't

torsional<00:02:24.970> rigidity<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.570> want<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
torsional rigidity we want to have the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.510 
torsional rigidity we want to have the
boot<00:02:26.140> that's<00:02:26.350> slightly<00:02:26.560> softer<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.250> flex

boot that's slightly softer and flex

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
boot that's slightly softer and flex
this<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.270> go<00:02:28.390> over<00:02:28.570> all<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> different

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
this way to go over all the different

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.630 
this way to go over all the different
type<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.260> terrain<00:02:29.560> you're<00:02:29.800> skiing<00:02:30.070> but

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
type of terrain you're skiing but

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.130 
type of terrain you're skiing but
maintain<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.240> great<00:02:31.450> Tours<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.810> rigidity

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
maintain that great Tours and rigidity

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.050 
maintain that great Tours and rigidity
so<00:02:32.500> when<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> put<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:33.010> edge<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.700> gives<00:02:33.760> you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so when you put it on edge it gives you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.660 
so when you put it on edge it gives you
unbelievably<00:02:35.020> good<00:02:35.230> hold<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.770> then<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> sole

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
unbelievably good hold and then the sole

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.550 
unbelievably good hold and then the sole
of<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.970> boot<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> has<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.600> removable<00:02:37.989> sole<00:02:38.410> but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
of this boot it has a removable sole but

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.600 
of this boot it has a removable sole but
that's<00:02:38.680> not<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.250> purpose<00:02:39.550> of

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that's not just for the purpose of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.400 
that's not just for the purpose of
replacing<00:02:40.209> where<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.050> couple<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
replacing where you can do a couple of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.900 
replacing where you can do a couple of
different<00:02:41.650> things<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.040> absolutely<00:02:42.190> all

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
different things with it absolutely all

traditional ski binding but they are

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.250 
traditional ski binding but they are
designed<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.000> they<00:02:55.120> can<00:02:55.269> be<00:02:55.390> interchangeable
