only<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.260> independent<00:00:43.770> artist<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
only and so as an independent artist the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.850 
only and so as an independent artist the
fact<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.430> he's<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.850> upstairs<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.530> good

when<00:00:47.160> people<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.300> reality<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
when people look at in reality I think

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
when people look at in reality I think
they<00:00:49.530> could<00:00:49.710> tell<00:00:49.950> he's<00:00:50.899> he's<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
they could tell he's he's down this
earth<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.680> he's<00:00:53.039> normally<00:00:53.550> he's<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> it's
