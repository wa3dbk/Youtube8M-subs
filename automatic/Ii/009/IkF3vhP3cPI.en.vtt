looks blue in the camera but it's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.120 
looks blue in the camera but it's
actually<00:01:04.280> purple<00:01:04.909> I<00:01:05.620> don't<00:01:06.620> know<00:01:06.710> exactly<00:01:07.010> why

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually purple I don't know exactly why

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.620 
actually purple I don't know exactly why
it's<00:01:07.250> come<00:01:07.370> across<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:07.790> way<00:01:07.940> but<00:01:08.000> it's

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
it's come across that way but it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.499 
it's come across that way but it's
purple<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.439> vector<00:01:10.189> 3d<00:01:11.000> tough<00:01:11.270> case

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
purple this is the vector 3d tough case

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.889 
purple this is the vector 3d tough case
and<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.840> actually<00:01:14.840> fills<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.619> kind<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.899> I

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
and it actually fills it kind of has a I

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.459 
and it actually fills it kind of has a I
mean<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.680> kind<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.729> semi<00:01:20.090> plasticville<00:01:20.600> but

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
mean it kind of a semi plasticville but

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.700 
mean it kind of a semi plasticville but
I'm<00:01:22.460> actually<00:01:22.840> accurate<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:24.110> lot<00:01:24.259> about<00:01:24.380> this

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
I'm actually accurate a lot about this

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.990 
I'm actually accurate a lot about this
online<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.430> seemed<00:01:25.549> like<00:01:25.579> it<00:01:25.729> was<00:01:25.820> really

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
online and it seemed like it was really

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.560 
online and it seemed like it was really
nice<00:01:26.090> case<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.520> over<00:01:28.789> here<00:01:28.939> we<00:01:29.060> have<00:01:29.090> its

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
nice case so over here we have its

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.660 
nice case so over here we have its
impact<00:01:30.020> resistant<00:01:30.530> as<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.799> Snapple<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.369> design

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
impact resistant as a Snapple in design

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.819 
impact resistant as a Snapple in design
and<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:32.000> has<00:01:32.090> raised<00:01:32.390> raised<00:01:33.170> edges<00:01:33.469> so<00:01:33.799> it

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
and it has raised raised edges so it

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.770 
and it has raised raised edges so it
protects<00:01:34.280> cream<00:01:34.579> really<00:01:34.759> well<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.450> they're

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
protects cream really well and they're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.539 
protects cream really well and they're
just<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.829> looks<00:01:36.979> like<00:01:37.159> on<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.090> back<00:01:38.359> and

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
just what it looks like on the back and

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.920 
just what it looks like on the back and
like<00:01:40.549> it's<00:01:40.789> made<00:01:40.939> for<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.149> new<00:01:41.240> ipod<00:01:41.659> touch

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
like it's made for the new ipod touch

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.620 
like it's made for the new ipod touch

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
all functions include a screen protector

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.419 
all functions include a screen protector
so<00:01:54.829> it's<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.579> nice<00:01:55.700> case<00:01:56.030> screen<00:01:56.810> protector

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
so it's a nice case screen protector

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.749 
so it's a nice case screen protector
that's<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.520> first<00:01:58.729> case<00:01:58.880> second<00:01:59.689> case<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.109> the

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
that's the first case second case is the

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.209 
that's the first case second case is the
work<00:02:01.759> mate<00:02:02.060> shock<00:02:02.539> absorbing<00:02:03.320> case<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.859> this

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
work mate shock absorbing case and this

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.700 
work mate shock absorbing case and this
kind<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.700> reminds<00:02:04.909> me<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.090> otterbox<00:02:05.719> I<00:02:05.990> mean

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
kind of reminds me of otterbox I mean
