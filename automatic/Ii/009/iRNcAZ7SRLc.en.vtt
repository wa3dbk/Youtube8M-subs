in Burbank Hall where the 45 students
live<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.770> morning<00:00:53.160> lectures<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
two afternoon sections a week so the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.970 
two afternoon sections a week so the
structure<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.899> let<00:00:58.739> them

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
structure of it is to let them

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.549 
structure of it is to let them
experience<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.030> arts<00:01:00.570> both<00:01:00.870> theoretically

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
experience the arts both theoretically

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
experience the arts both theoretically
and<00:01:01.649> practically<00:01:02.370> where<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.850> live<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:04.080> don't

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and practically where they live we don't

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
and practically where they live we don't
expect<00:01:04.650> our<00:01:04.830> students<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.400> artists<00:01:06.240> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
expect our students to be artists we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
expect our students to be artists we
expect<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> arts<00:01:07.320> engage<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
expect them to be arts engage and so the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.660 
expect them to be arts engage and so the
way<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:08.909> framed<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> class<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.799> went<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
way we framed the class we went from a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.450 
way we framed the class we went from a
question<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> purposefulness<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
question of is there a purposefulness to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
question of is there a purposefulness to
art<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:15.000> call<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> why<00:01:15.600> art<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.619> spent<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
art we call it why art and we spent the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
art we call it why art and we spent the
quarter<00:01:17.369> looking<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.909> art<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> perceptual

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
quarter looking at art from a perceptual

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
quarter looking at art from a perceptual
and<00:01:19.619> cognitive<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.460> neuro<00:01:20.640> scientific<00:01:21.150> view

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and cognitive and neuro scientific view

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.990 
and cognitive and neuro scientific view
and<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.080> end<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> year<00:01:22.820> questioning<00:01:23.820> why

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and then we end the year questioning why

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
and then we end the year questioning why
not<00:01:24.360> art<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.560> broad<00:01:25.799> question<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.520> when

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
not art with the broad question of when

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.749 
not art with the broad question of when
art<00:01:27.420> pushes<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> boundaries<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.220> its<00:01:29.520> own

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
art pushes the boundaries of of its own

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.090 
art pushes the boundaries of of its own
definition<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.079> art<00:01:31.350> pushes<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
definition and when art pushes the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.880 
definition and when art pushes the
boundaries<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.729> acceptable<00:01:33.350> social<00:01:34.350> behavior

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
boundaries of acceptable social behavior

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
boundaries of acceptable social behavior
what<00:01:35.549> does<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.700> mean<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.360> society<00:01:36.920> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
what does that mean for society the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
what does that mean for society the
great<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.659> we

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
great thing about it is that like we

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480 
great thing about it is that like we
don't<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.079> funds<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.130> answers

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
don't have funds as no one has answers

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.289 
don't have funds as no one has answers
and<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.189> knowing<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.119> bit

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and but we come up of it knowing a bit

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
and but we come up of it knowing a bit
more<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:45.810> how<00:01:46.140> art<00:01:46.560> has<00:01:46.770> progressed

of criticism and pen their take on how

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.089 
of criticism and pen their take on how
the<00:02:04.950> arts<00:02:05.460> evolved<00:02:06.000> makes<00:02:06.630> us<00:02:06.930> an<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.320> lively

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the arts evolved makes us an a lively

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.949 
the arts evolved makes us an a lively
experience<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.569> key<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
experience so I think it's it's key to

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.059 
experience so I think it's it's key to
making<00:02:10.349> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
making this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.720 
making this
work<00:02:11.540> we<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.719> on<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> really<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:14.129> personal
