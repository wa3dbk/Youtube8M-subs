what<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.830> kind<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.070> restructure<00:01:10.520> our<00:01:10.610> early<00:01:10.790> on

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910

our game you know our our team would be
better<00:01:18.950> off<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.400> something<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.270> figured<00:01:20.600> out

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
better off and something we figured out

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.620 
better off and something we figured out
no<00:01:22.400> one<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.610> perspective<00:01:23.090> Wayne<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:23.600> you
