as I was saying if I do start off muck

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.689 
as I was saying if I do start off muck
within<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> next<00:04:01.769> week<00:04:02.069> or<00:04:02.280> two<00:04:02.489> I'll

the<00:04:18.930> CPU<00:04:19.639> honestly<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:20.669> think<00:04:20.880> that's<00:04:21.359> boring

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
the CPU honestly I think that's boring

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.409 
the CPU honestly I think that's boring
some<00:04:23.130> y'all<00:04:23.400> might<00:04:23.669> actually<00:04:23.849> enjoy<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.300> and

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
some y'all might actually enjoy it and

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.800 
some y'all might actually enjoy it and
of<00:04:24.539> course<00:04:25.279> you<00:04:26.279> know<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.700> do<00:04:26.760> beat<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.330> CPU

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
of course you know if I do beat the CPU

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.580 
of course you know if I do beat the CPU
I<00:04:27.840> think

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
I think

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.200 
I think
well<00:04:29.160> if<00:04:29.220> it's<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.400> same<00:04:29.580> like<00:04:29.760> last<00:04:29.970> year<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
well if it's the same like last year you

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.000 
well if it's the same like last year you
get<00:04:30.360> coins<00:04:30.630> then<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.140> packs<00:04:31.410> afterwards

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
get coins then you get packs afterwards

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.300 
get coins then you get packs afterwards
