00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
because it subsequently made me feel

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
because it subsequently made me feel
worse<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.960> look<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.380> bit<00:00:25.560> worse<00:00:25.710> but

feeling good like most people do on

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
feeling good like most people do on
Facebook<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.160> stick<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
so a couple of things you've already
noticed<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:51.239> I've<00:00:51.420> already

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
noticed is that I would I've already

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
noticed is that I would I've already
sent<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> Eric<00:00:52.350> I've<00:00:52.469> already<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.800> my

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
sent this to Eric I've already got my

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
sent this to Eric I've already got my
feedback<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> weekend<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.059> did<00:00:54.750> mention

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
feedback for this weekend he did mention

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
feedback for this weekend he did mention
i'm<00:00:55.530> looking<00:00:56.039> watery<00:00:57.289> which<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.500> guess<00:00:59.539> what

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
i'm looking watery which I guess what

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
i'm looking watery which I guess what
I'm<00:01:00.719> trying<00:01:00.750> lots<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.289> eggs<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.649> insult<00:01:02.010> but

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
I'm trying lots as eggs and insult but

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
I'm trying lots as eggs and insult but
basically<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> couple<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
basically I think it's a couple of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.840 
basically I think it's a couple of
things<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.830> won<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> fact<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.670> have

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
things really won the fact that I have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
things really won the fact that I have
been<00:01:06.030> ill<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.330> also<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> fact<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
been ill but also the fact that my I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
been ill but also the fact that my I
think<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.010> sodium<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.670> been<00:01:08.909> particularly

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
think my sodium has been particularly

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.859 
think my sodium has been particularly
high<00:01:10.040> although<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.189> weight<00:01:11.400> hasn't<00:01:11.720> gone<00:01:12.720> up

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
high although my weight hasn't gone up

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.600 
high although my weight hasn't gone up
to<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.619> gone<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.130> half<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to much it has gone up about half a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
to much it has gone up about half a
pound<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.390> seems<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.869> regulated<00:01:16.759> since

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
pound it seems to have regulated since

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.840 
pound it seems to have regulated since
I've<00:01:17.939> been<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.450> India<00:01:19.759> because<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I've been back in India because I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
I've been back in India because I
dropped<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.570> pound<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> half<00:01:22.020> last

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
dropped sort of a pound and a half last

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.710 
dropped sort of a pound and a half last
week<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.159> gone<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.700> half<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> pound

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
week and it's now gone up a half a pound

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
week and it's now gone up a half a pound
so<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.970> still

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so I'm kind of back to you know still

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
so I'm kind of back to you know still
right<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.479> point<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> moment<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.530> perhaps

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
right on point at the moment but perhaps

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
right on point at the moment but perhaps
not<00:01:29.040> licking<00:01:29.250> his<00:01:29.460> lean<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> did<00:01:30.030> last<00:01:30.060> week

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
not licking his lean as I did last week
and<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.290> other<00:01:31.470> thing<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.040> surprising<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
and the other thing that surprising is
that<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.500> seem<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.680> losing<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.130> tan<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> was
