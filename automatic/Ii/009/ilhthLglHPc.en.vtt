00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because unlike other mtroniks it could

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
because unlike other mtroniks it could
be<00:01:05.790> controlled<00:01:06.360> by<00:01:06.659> human<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.710> means<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
be controlled by human which means it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820
