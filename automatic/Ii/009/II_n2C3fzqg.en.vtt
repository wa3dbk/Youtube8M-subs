00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
want to practice as as you're moving the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.330 
want to practice as as you're moving the
ball<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.000> guy<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.240> the<00:00:36.480> wall<00:00:37.100> at<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
ball from this guy to the wall at that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
ball from this guy to the wall at that
make<00:00:39.060> sure<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.330> this<00:00:39.480> guy<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.750> also

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
make sure that this guy is also

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.670 
make sure that this guy is also
following<00:00:40.850> as<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> hit<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.080> hit<00:00:43.320> happens

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
following as the hit as this hit happens

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
following as the hit as this hit happens
towards<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> wall<00:00:44.220> keep<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.780> bar

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
towards the wall keep have the bar

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
towards the wall keep have the bar
continue<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.130> against<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> wall

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
continue all the way up against the wall

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.630 
continue all the way up against the wall
so<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.090> guy<00:00:48.380> comes<00:00:49.380> up<00:00:49.650> comes<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so that this guy comes up comes to the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660 
so that this guy comes up comes to the
wall<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.150> then<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> bounces<00:00:52.670> then

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
wall and then when it bounces then

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
wall and then when it bounces then
you're<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.120> gonna<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.480> following<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you're you're gonna be following the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.380 
you're you're gonna be following the
wall<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.830> here<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.310> bounces<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
wall from here it bounces this this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
wall from here it bounces this this
guy's<00:00:57.600> gonna<00:00:57.810> follow<00:00:58.080> the<00:00:58.260> ball<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.650> since

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
guy's gonna follow the ball and since

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.590 
guy's gonna follow the ball and since
the<00:00:59.280> balls<00:00:59.460> moving<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> hit

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the balls moving this way when you hit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.230 
the balls moving this way when you hit
it<00:01:00.630> that<00:01:01.320> creates<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.770> natural<00:01:02.370> natural

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
it that creates that natural natural

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:20.599 
it that creates that natural natural
angle<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:05.420> practice<00:01:06.420> things<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:19.609> to

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
angle so practice things like this to

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.389 
angle so practice things like this to
the<00:01:20.700> wall<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.630> guy<00:01:21.840> hits<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.469> wall<00:01:22.649> waits

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
the wall this guy hits the wall waits

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.219 
the wall this guy hits the wall waits
for<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> ball<00:01:23.880> ahead<00:01:23.999> when<00:01:24.719> it<00:01:24.840> goes<00:01:24.960> back

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
for the ball ahead when it goes back

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
for the ball ahead when it goes back
then<00:01:25.829> this<00:01:25.979> outside<00:01:26.520> guy<00:01:26.670> hits<00:01:26.939> hits<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.479> wall

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
then this outside guy hits hits the wall

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
then this outside guy hits hits the wall
in<00:01:27.719> an<00:01:27.810> angle<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.920> practice<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
in an angle so just practice that and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.200 
in an angle so just practice that and
then<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:31.319> then<00:01:31.469> DUP<00:01:31.670> that'll<00:01:32.670> improve<00:01:32.969> your

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then and then DUP that'll improve your

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
then and then DUP that'll improve your
your<00:01:33.840> consistency<00:01:34.499> and<00:01:34.649> then<00:01:34.710> after<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.069> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
your consistency and then after that you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.059 
your consistency and then after that you
can<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:36.469> increasing<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.799> speed

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
can you can start increasing the speed

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.859 
can you can start increasing the speed
and<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:38.969> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.569> hit<00:01:39.719> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and see if you can actually hit the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.179 
and see if you can actually hit the
swing<00:01:40.079> shadow<00:01:40.319> that<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.039> faster<00:01:41.549> pace

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.200 

so<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.090> make<00:01:48.390> sure<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:49.969> let<00:01:50.969> you<00:01:51.090> do

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so so just make sure you do let you do

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.550 
so so just make sure you do let you do
those<00:01:51.360> those<00:01:51.719> drills<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.320> should<00:01:52.500> be

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
those those drills and you should be

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
those those drills and you should be
able<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.070> fairly<00:01:53.460> consistent<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
able to get fairly consistent with it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.160 
able to get fairly consistent with it
like<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.229> said<00:01:55.289> do<00:01:55.860> things<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.990> be

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
like I said do things like that just be

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
like I said do things like that just be
conscious<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> fact<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.060> guy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
conscious of the fact that that this guy

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020 
conscious of the fact that that this guy
has<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.509> follow<00:02:00.840> let<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> ball<00:02:01.649> bounce<00:02:02.189> then

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
has to follow let the ball bounce then

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.689 
has to follow let the ball bounce then
you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.479> ahead
