00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome to the apples today i will tell 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.259
 you on how to view photos and videos 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.370
 or listen to music from the computer on 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.750
 iphone ipod touch or ipad 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.340
 Of course, I mean the way 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.300
 which content will not flip 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 on the device for this you can 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.609
 use apps from the appstore under 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.080
 name stream tumi 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 after the launch of the program is carried out 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.990
 search for available computers on which 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.700
 running the server side of the application 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.170
 further we will see a list of shared folders 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.410
 in each of which you can go and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.730
 view content from it 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.390
 mixing options are available and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 sort the list in folders 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.110
 view images directly 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160
 as follows 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.120
 photos can be scrolled by hand 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 or run a slideshow 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 loading the next photo at 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 scrolling takes from 1 to 3 seconds 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 at the same time the size of files ranges from 2 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 up to 3 megabytes of course if the size 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.450
 files will be larger then upload snapshots 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.220
 will happen a little longer such 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 all owners will be able to appreciate the inconvenience 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 and devices that have more than one problem 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 place on their devices when 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.729
 using the application data is not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 cached stream Tomi reminds normal 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.439
 file viewer and does not possess 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.450
 extended functionality worth mentioning 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.180
 about the possibility to broadcast photos and videos 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 via air-play to be honest I can not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 it's hard to understand why this feature is needed 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 imagine what situation is necessary 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 Stream video to and device from one 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.579
 computer and output ivan via airplay 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 on the other since the program itself 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.869
 actually it does not reproduce the content and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.299
 just opens it on the computer and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.159
 displays the image on your screen no 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.750
 restrictions in the supported list 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.159
 of files 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.049
 you can open and listen 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.000
 compositions in any of the formats 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.850
 supported by your computer as well 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.710
 watch video for most 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 users just watching the video 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.630
 remotely of interest in this 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.430
 I will now show the application as a program 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 works with video 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.509
 I have 2 loaded on my computer 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.520
 full uncoded and uncompressed 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.850
 the movie one of which has an extension 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.080
 avi other mkv 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.910
 as you can see when you first run the file 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.930
 may need ten to 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.410
 fifteen seconds to start 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.270
 further playback program 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 works smoothly without lags and 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.370
 slowdowns rewind video too 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.850
 happens quite quickly and takes 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.050
 about two or three seconds 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.100
 any video can be viewed in 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.200
 original size 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.200
 either fit to ipad screen size 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.790
 everyone who likes to watch movies on 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.010
 tablet but don't want to waste time on 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.480
 copying recoding data by 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 dignity will appreciate the stream to me 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.660
 the application has the necessary 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.500
 minimum settings and also displays 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 browsing history again 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.250
 I want to emphasize the fact that the program 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.730
 doesn't leave cached files on 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.800
 device to show this i'll come in 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.180
 memory usage statistics and show 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.180
 given by this application 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.650
 for the program to work 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.739
 I installed and running the server part 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.370

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.470
 get dressed 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.599

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.590
 but the users tab can be distinguished 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.949
