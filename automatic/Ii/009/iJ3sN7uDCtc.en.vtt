00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.020 

we're<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.439> review<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.310> anatomy<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:02.820> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
we're going to review the anatomy of the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
we're going to review the anatomy of the
skeletal<00:00:03.449> muscles<00:00:03.810> starting<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.069> most

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
skeletal muscles starting with the most

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.940 
skeletal muscles starting with the most
superficial<00:00:05.759> location<00:00:06.569> which<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:09.559> FM<00:00:10.559> ECM

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
superficial location which is the FM ECM

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.870 
superficial location which is the FM ECM
out<00:00:11.130> here<00:00:11.490> moving<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:13.830> most<00:00:14.400> microscopic

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
out here moving to the most microscopic

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.220 
out here moving to the most microscopic
level<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.699> sarcomere<00:00:17.699> down<00:00:18.480> here

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.019 

so<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.500> epimysium<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> connective

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so the epimysium is the connective

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.920 
so the epimysium is the connective
tissue<00:00:24.210> sheath<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:26.510> covers<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.810> entire

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
tissue sheath that covers an entire

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.410 
tissue sheath that covers an entire
scale<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.890> muscle<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> outside

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
scale to muscle out here on the outside

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
scale to muscle out here on the outside
and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.590> epimysium<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> connective<00:00:32.850> tissue

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and the epimysium is a connective tissue

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.630 
and the epimysium is a connective tissue
that<00:00:33.440> basically<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.680> blends<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that basically just blends into the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
that basically just blends into the
tendon<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.110> be

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
tendon right here which is going to be

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.670 
tendon right here which is going to be
attaching<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.890> muscle<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.879> bone<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.500> cut

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
attaching this muscle to bone if we cut

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
attaching this muscle to bone if we cut
open<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.250> skeletal<00:00:41.700> muscle<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.660> all

open a skeletal muscle you would see all

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 
open a skeletal muscle you would see all
of<00:00:42.960> these<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.320> circles<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of these little circles right here and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.569 
of these little circles right here and
if<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.000> pull<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.870> circles<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.579> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
if we pull one of these circles out it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
if we pull one of these circles out it's
actually<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> bundle<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.930> skeletal<00:00:49.530> muscle

smaller<00:03:18.519> myofilaments<00:03:20.170> which<00:03:21.170> are<00:03:21.320> called

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
smaller myofilaments which are called

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.340 
smaller myofilaments which are called
actin<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.220> myosin<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.540> arrangement<00:03:24.200> of

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.830 
actin and myosin and the arrangement of
them<00:03:24.620> give<00:03:25.250> rise<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.970> structure<00:03:26.480> called

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
them give rise to this structure called

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.289 
them give rise to this structure called
the<00:03:27.200> circle<00:03:27.620> mirror<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.010> it's<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.730> actin<00:03:29.180> and

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
the circle mirror and it's the actin and

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.210 
the circle mirror and it's the actin and
myosin<00:03:29.359> filaments<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.290> actually<00:03:30.709> contract

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
myosin filaments that actually contract

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.759 
myosin filaments that actually contract
to<00:03:31.910> cause<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.540> entire<00:03:32.780> skeletal<00:03:33.290> muscle<00:03:33.560> to

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
to cause the entire skeletal muscle to

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.390 
to cause the entire skeletal muscle to
contract<00:03:34.069> so<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.790> myofibrils<00:03:38.600> are<00:03:39.440> actually

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
contract so the myofibrils are actually

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.720 
contract so the myofibrils are actually
made<00:03:40.639> up<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.870> smaller<00:03:41.870> myofilaments<00:03:42.859> protein

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
made up of smaller myofilaments protein

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.590 
made up of smaller myofilaments protein
filaments<00:03:43.940> called

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
filaments called

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.140 
filaments called
actin<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.019> myosin<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.250> arrangement<00:03:46.940> of

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
actin and myosin the arrangement of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.050 
actin and myosin the arrangement of
actin<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.750> myosin<00:03:47.840> make<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.280> sarcomere

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
actin and myosin make up the sarcomere

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.500 
actin and myosin make up the sarcomere
right<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> sarcomere<00:03:51.859> runs<00:03:52.519> from

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
right here so the sarcomere runs from

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.890 
right here so the sarcomere runs from
this<00:03:54.019> area<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.400> area<00:03:55.459> that's<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.450> circle

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
this area to this area that's one circle

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.069 
this area to this area that's one circle
mayor<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.829> here's<00:03:58.100> one<00:03:58.569> circle<00:03:59.569> mirror<00:03:59.810> and

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
mayor so here's one circle mirror and

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.129 
mayor so here's one circle mirror and
here's<00:04:00.380> one<00:04:00.739> circle<00:04:01.730> mirror<00:04:01.970> they<00:04:02.569> run<00:04:02.870> from

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
here's one circle mirror they run from

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.590 
here's one circle mirror they run from
if<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:03.769> at<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.069> blue<00:04:04.519> line<00:04:04.819> right<00:04:04.850> here

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
if you look at this blue line right here

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.970 
if you look at this blue line right here
which<00:04:06.079> is<00:04:06.850> similar<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.060> right<00:04:08.239> here<00:04:08.980> sarcomere

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
which is similar to right here sarcomere

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.720 
which is similar to right here sarcomere
runs<00:04:10.310> from<00:04:10.609> 1<00:04:10.940> z<00:04:11.329> disk<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:12.560> another<00:04:12.859> z<00:04:13.220> disk

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.090 

so<00:04:17.730> we<00:04:17.850> have<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> arrangement<00:04:18.389> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.230> actin

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
so we have the arrangement of the actin

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.320 
so we have the arrangement of the actin
and<00:04:20.340> myosin<00:04:20.630> filaments<00:04:21.830> actin<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:23.330> attached

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
and myosin filaments actin is attached

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.650 
and myosin filaments actin is attached
to<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:25.050> z<00:04:25.230> disk<00:04:25.910> which<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> right<00:04:27.270> here<00:04:27.300> this

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
to the z disk which is right here this

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.190 
to the z disk which is right here this
is<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.960> thin<00:04:28.169> filament<00:04:28.790> myosin<00:04:29.790> runs<00:04:30.720> along

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
is the thin filament myosin runs along

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.780 
is the thin filament myosin runs along
the<00:04:31.410> middle<00:04:31.710> here<00:04:31.919> okay

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
the middle here okay

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.900 
the middle here okay
the<00:04:33.360> dead<00:04:33.660> center<00:04:34.139> of<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.680> circle<00:04:34.919> mirror<00:04:35.520> which

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
the dead center of a circle mirror which

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.640 
the dead center of a circle mirror which
would<00:04:36.120> come<00:04:36.330> down<00:04:36.510> like<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.410> called

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
would come down like this it's called

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.270 
would come down like this it's called
the<00:04:37.860> M<00:04:38.330> line<00:04:39.380> there's<00:04:40.380> an<00:04:40.560> area<00:04:41.010> right<00:04:41.040> here

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the M line there's an area right here

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.080 
the M line there's an area right here
where<00:04:42.440> there's<00:04:43.440> only<00:04:46.190> myosin<00:04:47.190> there's<00:04:47.669> no

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
where there's only myosin there's no

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.659 
where there's only myosin there's no
active<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:49.530> called<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.980> H<00:04:51.169> zone<00:04:52.169> and

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
active and that is called the H zone and

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.850 
active and that is called the H zone and
when<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:54.660> contraction<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> sarcomeres

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
when the contraction of the sarcomeres

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.909 
when the contraction of the sarcomeres
occurs<00:04:56.250> these<00:04:57.000> myosin<00:04:57.660> heads<00:04:58.230> will<00:04:58.770> be

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
occurs these myosin heads will be

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.520 
occurs these myosin heads will be
binding<00:04:59.160> on<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.610> actin<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.240> they<00:05:00.900> pull<00:05:01.230> them

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
binding on to actin and they pull them

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.370 
binding on to actin and they pull them
towards<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:03.180> H<00:05:03.419> zone<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> again<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.169> the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
towards the H zone so again we have the

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.610 
towards the H zone so again we have the
M<00:05:07.620> line<00:05:07.650> which<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.760> center<00:05:09.440> there's<00:05:10.440> an
