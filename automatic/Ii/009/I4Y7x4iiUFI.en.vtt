control it may be one little thing that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.800 
control it may be one little thing that
they're<00:00:31.919> afraid<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.310> once<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.180> conquer<00:00:33.630> that

they're afraid of once they conquer that

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.920 
they're afraid of once they conquer that
then<00:00:34.560> you<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.760> development<00:00:36.150> seems<00:00:36.720> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
then you know the development seems to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
then you know the development seems to
hit<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> quantum<00:00:37.950> leap<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> hits

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
hit a quantum leap and it hits

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
hit a quantum leap and it hits
hyperspeed<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.720> it<00:00:40.320> develops<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.310> fast

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
hyperspeed and it develops really fast

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.390 
hyperspeed and it develops really fast
if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.970> can<00:00:42.120> identify<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.110> conquer<00:00:43.800> these

if you can identify and conquer these
water<00:00:44.880> fears<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.660> general<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:47.100> early<00:00:47.579> age

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.830

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
submerging body part

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.500 
submerging body part
now<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.380> may<00:00:56.560> sound<00:00:56.830> trivial<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.030> adult

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
now it may sound trivial to the adult

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.320 
now it may sound trivial to the adult
but<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.830> kid<00:01:00.040> this<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.400> very<00:01:00.730> very<00:01:00.970> real

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
but to the kid this is a very very real

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.450 
but to the kid this is a very very real
fear<00:01:01.630> so<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.260> need<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.650> be<00:01:03.010> aware<00:01:03.250> that

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
fear so you need to be aware that

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.280 
fear so you need to be aware that
sometimes<00:01:03.790> when<00:01:04.330> kids<00:01:04.570> are<00:01:04.660> scared<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.230> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
sometimes when kids are scared of the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.680 
sometimes when kids are scared of the
water<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.860> may<00:01:06.370> be<00:01:06.430> simply<00:01:07.090> related<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
water it may be simply related to the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.660 
water it may be simply related to the
fact<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.110> they<00:01:08.320> are<00:01:08.470> afraid<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:08.950> submerging

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
fact that they are afraid of submerging

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.700 
fact that they are afraid of submerging
certain<00:01:10.090> body<00:01:10.330> parts<00:01:10.780> now<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.500> can<00:01:11.680> be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
certain body parts now it can be

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.440 
certain body parts now it can be
anywhere<00:01:12.520> on<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.970> body

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
anywhere on the body

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.510 
anywhere on the body
but<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.500> be<00:01:14.590> hid<00:01:14.740> at<00:01:14.860> me<00:01:15.010> could<00:01:15.250> be<00:01:15.280> their

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
but it can be hid at me could be their

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.370 
but it can be hid at me could be their
shoulders<00:01:15.880> could<00:01:16.060> be<00:01:16.210> their<00:01:16.360> hands<00:01:16.570> but<00:01:17.020> most

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
actually afraid to submerge so pay

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.820 
actually afraid to submerge so pay
attention<00:01:28.060> when<00:01:28.840> you're<00:01:28.990> little<00:01:29.530> scared

sign that they're afraid of submerging a

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.260 
sign that they're afraid of submerging a
certain<00:01:39.460> body<00:01:39.880> part<00:01:41.610> okay<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.640> wanted<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.060> talk

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
certain body part okay I wanted to talk

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.330 
certain body part okay I wanted to talk
to<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.510> parent<00:01:43.900> briefly<00:01:44.470> when<00:01:45.190> you're

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
to the parent briefly when you're

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.310 
to the parent briefly when you're
dealing<00:01:45.580> with<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:46.060> younger<00:01:46.570> swimmer<00:01:47.080> you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
dealing with your younger swimmer you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.620

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
might have a little bit a few fears and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.240 
might have a little bit a few fears and
they<00:01:49.690> might<00:01:49.840> be<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.229> little<00:01:50.440> bit<00:01:50.680> timid<00:01:50.950> or<00:01:51.130> shy

they might be a little bit timid or shy

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.370 
they might be a little bit timid or shy
around<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.910> water<00:01:52.090> there<00:01:52.540> are<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.690> few<00:01:53.020> tricks

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
around the water there are a few tricks

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.290 
around the water there are a few tricks
to<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.400> biggest<00:01:54.610> thing<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.000> probably

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
to it and the biggest thing is probably

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.910 
to it and the biggest thing is probably
the<00:01:55.479> parent<00:01:55.869> making<00:01:56.440> sure<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.770> they

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the parent making sure that they

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920 
the parent making sure that they
actually<00:01:57.040> stay<00:01:57.460> calm<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.210> they're<00:01:58.330> relaxed

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
actually stay calm and they're relaxed

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.260 
actually stay calm and they're relaxed
and<00:01:59.080> that's<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.530> swimmer<00:01:59.800> feels<00:02:00.160> safe<00:02:00.610> if<00:02:00.880> you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
and that's a swimmer feels safe if you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.029 
and that's a swimmer feels safe if you
can<00:02:01.479> create<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.899> environment<00:02:02.710> for<00:02:02.950> your

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
can create that environment for your

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.290 
can create that environment for your

back also a lack of support
now<00:04:33.140> there's<00:04:33.380> two<00:04:33.620> magic<00:04:34.190> places<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:34.790> you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
now there's two magic places that you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.300 
now there's two magic places that you
can<00:04:35.180> actually<00:04:35.480> put<00:04:35.840> support<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.950> helps

the swimmer develop freely and it kind

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.590 
the swimmer develop freely and it kind
of<00:04:39.919> frees<00:04:40.220> their<00:04:40.490> mind<00:04:40.760> of<00:04:40.970> having<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.360> stay

ones<00:04:44.690> on<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> back<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.320> head<00:04:45.530> one<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.460> just

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
ones on the back of the head one is just

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.970 
ones on the back of the head one is just
underneath<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.480> hips<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.080> if<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.680> apply

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
underneath the hips and if you apply

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
support in those two areas then your

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.720 
support in those two areas then your
swimmer<00:04:52.040> will<00:04:52.340> stay<00:04:52.640> up<00:04:52.820> nice<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.419> easy
